That's a ridiculously huge number but just for the sake of argument all allow it. 100 staff members needed before January is 0.002 percent of the amount of resumes he's received.

In that case it becomes a frozen conflict ala the Korean War. It would be much better for the US and Europe to back Ukraine until the Russians have to quit. That doesn't mean Ukraine gets all of its pre-2014 territory back however. Ukraine giving up weapons is bad not only for Ukraine but also for Europe/NATO.

426,None of this screed addresses the notion that Europe is one of the major sources of funding for Russia's war in Ukraine and that they've failed to rise to the threat of Russian revanchism. I wasn't addressing that notion. You wanted me to address that notion because you think you can somehow argue against that with uhm well we technically spend a couple billion more on oil than on Ukranian aid. Checkmate! when that has been frequently explained by the fact that a) purchases of Russian resources have diminished by sometimes as much as 90% compared to pre-war levels and b) the remaining 10% of purchases are only waht is necessary so Europe has the manufacturing capacity to actually continue supporting Ukraine. The remaining 10% are scheduled to run out in 2027 and the only one who will still keep importing is Hungary cause we know Orban sucks Putin's dick. Literally a ton of the support necessary for your statement to work is that yes two countries in Europe are Putin stooges so we know they do and will continue to buy resources. That doesn't invalidate the 90% drop compared to pre-war levels and the complete phase out. You can complain all you want about Trump (and fuck that guy all the way to the sun) but if Europe had been pulling its weight since the beginning of this and actually showed some real goddamn initiative Trump wouldn't matter. We've been consistently supporting Ukraine more than the fucking US throughout mid-2025 to the tune of 10-20% more and the only reason Americans even go back on this shit is because while they deliver weapons directly and inflate the worth of 20 year old equipment we directly pay premium for these weapons. America has taken a rocket worth a million in 1995 slapped a $1 million price tag on it in 2025 and sent it over to Ukraine at a premium while the MIC re-stocks the American capacities. I know it's something Americans don't like to hear but even fucking Biden slow-trickled the aid deliveries and inflated the numbers to give the MIC more profit.

704,In my opinion Legolas is the worst part of the Hobbit trilogy. He feels shoehorned in and the editing done to de-age Orlando Bloom is bad at best.
