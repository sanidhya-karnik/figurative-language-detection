The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/24/young-men-democrats-us-elections#comments,Why did young men move left in this month’s US elections? | Cory Alpert,"Just a few months ago, it seemed that the political landscape was changing permanently, with young people shifting right – especially young men. Democrats spun up a vortex of efforts to win them back, but they often appeared to be flailing. This month’s elections, however, told a different story.

Young men in the US face a political identity crisis. It should not be controversial to say that the world that many were promised as children has not come to fruition. Two decades of war and a turbulent economy have combined with a massively changing workforce. Young men’s disaffection should come as no real surprise.

An entire ecosystem of hucksters has emerged to take advantage of these young people, peddling a dark vision that offers violence and control as a response to a changing world. Meanwhile, the Democratic party failed to imagine a political future that included these young men. In Democrats’ parlance, anyone who took one step in that direction was hopelessly lost, unable to see the beautiful egalitarian future that we could create together.

There is a fine line here. I am not arguing for the redemption, welcome, or whitewashing of the people who have peddled this bleak reality. But we can and should build a political coalition that includes this generation, that doesn’t leave them out in the cold, only to find a home in the most bleak fringes of a political movement that tells them that a lust for control over other people, especially women, is the only way to find meaning.

On the left, we tell ourselves the story of our own vaunted sympathy, and yet we assign only blame to the young men who do something similar, looking for community and only finding it among the most opportunistic and dangerous political movements. We have done little to welcome them in.

And while Democrats had solid policies and economic plans, Republicans, backed by an army of digital content, were able to take the mantle of running on the economy and framing the left as cultural warriors out of touch with the majority of Americans.

But the good news is that this month’s elections in Virginia, New Jersey and New York City show Democrats have learned a lesson.

The three marquee campaigns of this year were all remarkably similar, despite coming from different parts of the ideological spectrum. Their messaging was relentlessly focused on affordability – how expensive and difficult life has become for the working and middle-class people of their communities. Their solutions covered a wide ideological range, but the focus remained the same.

Most young men, like most trans people and Black people and immigrants and everyone else, are dealing with housing that has skyrocketed in price, especially compared with our parents’ generations. Instead of having one career in our lifetimes, we now have to continually seek new jobs. Living independently as an adult is much more expensive and complicated now than it has been. These affordability campaigns gave young men something to do about those pressures rather than ceding that frustration to the most cynical actors.

Undoubtedly this conversation is easier to have when Donald Trump is taking three steps every day to dismantle the economy. There’s a real sense that the economy is getting worse. That it’s more difficult to pay bills and keep food on the table, especially when Republicans are, quite literally, ensuring that 42 million people cannot afford to keep food on their table by refusing to fund Snap during their government shutdown.

Republicans got distracted, trying to defend Trump and also trying to repeat his playbook of tying Democrats to the culture war of the moment. But without Trump’s singular ability to control a media narrative, Republicans with far less political talent and capital floundered, making themselves look weak and silly in the process.

The political miracle is that this ruthless focus on affordability and cost of living may have brought in many of those same young men who had followed Trump a year ago. In Virginia and New Jersey, men under 30 broke for their new Democratic governors, with about six in 10 supporting Spanberger, according to the AP. In New York, young men went for Zohran Mamdani over Andrew Cuomo by a margin of nearly 40 points, according to a Tufts Circle analysis.

It turns out that these young men are not completely lost to us. We just failed to imagine a reality where they could be in our camp.

Affordability broke through amid the longest government shutdown in US history, as consumer prices were rising ever higher thanks in part to Trump’s tariffs. For all of his bluster, eventually the economic reality becomes an unavoidable political crisis for anyone not far gone in his cult of personality who has to pay their bills.

Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey, Abigail Spanberger in Virginia, and Mamdani in New York City showed us that the frustration that every working and middle-class person feels could be directed into a political coalition that sees marginalized people as people also affected by the greed and corruption that has made life unaffordable for so many.

Young men, like everyone else, are looking for a politics that can make life a little better. Democrats are finally figuring out how to offer them that chance.",2025-11-24 00:00:00,literal,Factual reporting on reporting and policy,literal,literal,0,figurative,0.1464866,0.8535134,0.8535134,False

Random House

The publication date Patti Smith chose for her latest memoir, Bread of Angels, is not just happenstance: Nov. 4 is the day her husband Fred ""Sonic"" Smith died (in 1994), and the birthday of her comrade-in-arts, Robert Mapplethorpe (in 1946). Both men died in their 40s, ""the love of my life and the artist of my life,"" the celebrated punk rock star and author writes.

Bread of Angels is Smith's most straightforwardly autobiographical book to date. It touches on material she's written about before, but her focus this time is her trajectory from a working class childhood in Pennsylvania and south Jersey into her stage and recording career — which she put on hiatus during her marriage and reignited during her widowhood. The title Bread of Angels refers to the ""unpremeditated gestures of kindness"" Smith has experienced along the way, which color her essentially optimistic attitude toward life.

In the last 15 years, Smith has produced a tidy collection of small books that braid ruminations on her current endeavors with memories and photographs of her much-missed lovers and friends. The best is her National Book Award-winning Just Kids (2010), an extraordinarily resonant record of her relationship with Mapplethorpe. A Book of Days, in which she commemorates her journeys, personal touchstones, and the birth and death dates of her various heroes with evocative snapshots and brief appreciations, underscores her associations of people and memories with specific dates.

Smith credits her parents for a stable, nurturing childhood despite economic and health challenges. Her father, Grant Harrison Smith, returned to Philadelphia from active duty in New Guinea and the Philippines ""emotionally broken and plagued with malaria-induced migraines."" Jilted by his longtime girlfriend, he reconnected with Beverly Williams, whom he had known in high school. Their first three (of four) children came in rapid succession. Unable to complete his education, Smith's father worked the night shift in a union factory; her mother waited tables.

Smith, born in 1946, writes that she was a sickly baby whose ""Proustian childhood, one of intermittent quarantine and convalescence,"" was marked by numerous contagious diseases, but also by free-ranging fantasy play with her siblings, ""a visceral need to be free,"" and an early passion for books, shared with her mother.

In her first four years of life, Smith's family relocated 11 times, forced out of a series of condemned buildings. When she was 8, her parents bought a house in a lower-middle class development for veterans in rural south Jersey. Her Bible-reading father rejected organized religion, but her mother became an active Jehovah's Witness, taking her children with her to knock on doors. By her teens, Smith discovered her calling in music and art. When she was 15, she writes, ""The angels served a new portion; I discovered [the French poet] Arthur Rimbaud.""

Much of the material in Bread of Angels will be familiar to readers of Smith's prior memoirs, including recaps of her early years in 1960s and 1970s New York City. But she goes into more detail about her swift rise from poet to punk rocker, and the production of her first album, Horses, now celebrating its 50th anniversary. ""There was no plan, no design, just an organic upheaval that took me from written to spoken word,"" she writes. ""From solitude to collaboration ... One thing tumbled into another.""

Her account of her devotion to Fred Sonic Smith, for whom she cast off ""the mantle of fame and fortune"" and moved to Detroit, is unabashedly gushing. ""I knew instantly he would be my life. Such is the terrible mystery of love, that draws us from all that we know,"" she writes. Grounded by domesticity and children, she turned to writing, but struggled with ""characters in stories reluctant to be born, until I shook the cage of imagination, shocked them free to wreak havoc, gather wishes and trample time."" What's shocking here is the overwriting from the ordinarily pitch perfect Smith.

At points, the last third of Bread of Angels reads like quick notes for future biographers. But there are intriguing revelations, including the surprising discovery that Grant Smith was not her biological father — whose identity was uncovered with the help of the daughter she gave up for adoption when she was barely 20.

Smith's tally of her many losses in the 1980s and 1990s brings to mind the 19th century French writer Gustave Flaubert, who, after the deaths of several close friends, commented: ""My heart is becoming a necropolis."" Smith might relate. But her attitude is better reflected by her new book's upbeat epigraph, from another 19th century author, Nikolai Gogol: ""Obstacles are our wings."" Smith is a survivor who has made it her mission to ""leap back up"" and keep going after setbacks. Now approaching the end of her 70s, she has remained active — performing, touring, traveling and writing.

The tone of Bread of Angels veers between elegy and engagement. She mourns ""the worlds I knew, the hopes of my generation,"" yet celebrates ""the concentrative energy of a new idea emerging."" She concludes that her ""incandescent restlessness has somewhat quelled"" but that she hasn't changed much. Her latest project: ""the excruciating yet exquisite process of letting go.""

Al Jazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/24/ukraine-allies-give-cautious-welcome-to-modified-peace-framework,Ukraine allies give cautious welcome to ‘modified’ peace framework,"Trump claims ‘big progress’, but signs of discord from Russia persist as Putin aide Ushakov says revisions ‘unsuitable for us’.

European allies of Ukraine have given a cautious welcome to efforts to refine a United States peace proposal initially criticised for appearing to be weighted in favour of Russia’s maximalist demands.

The leaders of Germany, Finland, Poland and the United Kingdom were among those agreeing on Monday that progress had been made in the previous day’s talks between Washington and Kyiv in Geneva that yielded what the US and Ukraine called a “refined peace framework”.

Still, the European leaders stressed that work remained to be done.

“It was possible to clear up some questions, but we also know that there won’t be peace in Ukraine overnight,” said German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, adding that the peace plan initially drafted by the US had been “modified in significant parts”.

He welcomed the “interim result”.

“The next step must be that Russia must come to the table,” Merz said from Angola, where he was attending a summit between African and European Union countries. “This is a laborious process. It will move forward at most in smaller steps this week. I do not expect there to be a breakthrough this week.”

US President Donald Trump had blindsided Kyiv and its European countries last week with a 28-point peace plan criticised by some as a Russian wish list that called for Ukraine to cede more territory, accept limits on its military and abandon its ambitions to join NATO.

Britain, France and Germany responded by drawing up a counterproposal that would cease fighting at the present front lines, leaving discussions of territory for later, and include a NATO-style US security guarantee for Ukraine, according to a draft seen by Reuters news agency.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Monday that the peace plan now contained fewer than 28 points and incorporated “correct elements”, stressing that he would discuss “sensitive issues, the most delicate points” with Trump.

UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said that Ukraine’s allies in the “coalition of the willing” – a broad term for about 30 countries supporting Kyiv – will hold talks about the negotiations on Tuesday by video.

The German Foreign Office said that the chief diplomats of Germany, Finland, France, the UK, Italy and Poland consulted Monday with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha on further steps towards ending the war.

Also attending the summit in Angola, European Council President Antonio Costa said there was “new momentum” in negotiations.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the European Union would “engage further tomorrow with our partners from the coalition of the willing”.

‘Big progress’

On Monday, Trump indicated Sunday’s talks had gone well.

“Is it really possible that big progress is being made in Peace Talks between Russia and Ukraine??? Don’t believe it until you see it, but something good just may be happening,” the US president wrote on Truth Social.

Trump had given Zelenskyy, who is under the doubled pressure of Russia’s continued advance on the front line and a corruption scandal that has tainted his administration, until Thursday to agree to a framework to end the war. He also accused Zelenskyy of showing “zero gratitude” for peace efforts.

Still, The Ukrainian president welcomed Trump’s “constructive” approach on Monday.

Earlier that day, he said on X that Ukraine would “continue working with partners, especially the United States, and look for compromises that strengthen but not weaken us”.

Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk also said on Monday that negotiations were a “delicate matter” since “no one wants to discourage Americans and President Trump from having the United States on our side in this process”.

The Kremlin said it had not been informed of the results of the Geneva talks, but that it was aware that “adjustments” were made to the US proposal.

In a call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin repeated his view that the initial US plan could “serve as a basis for a final peace settlement”.

During the call, Erdogan said Turkiye was ready to support efforts to bring Russia and Ukraine together, including helping to facilitate direct talks between the two.

However, Russian presidential aide Yuri Ushakov said the European plan appeared “entirely unconstructive and unsuitable for us”, according to a report in the Russian state-run TASS news agency.

Reporting from Moscow, Al Jazeera’s Yulia Shapovalova said Russia was unlikely to accept the European revisions.

“If all Russian conditions and interests are not taken into account, Russia is ready to continue fighting because, according to Vladimir Putin, Russia is pretty successful on the battlefield and it wants to achieve its goals,” she said.

In comments made by video to a meeting at the Swedish parliament, Zelenskyy had indicated that territory would still be a key sticking point, accusing Putin of seeking “legal recognition for what he has stolen”.

Grim reality

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has decimated the east of the country, forcing millions to flee their homes, ravaging towns and cities, and killing tens of thousands in Europe’s worst conflict since World War II.

On Monday, the nearly four-year war continued to grind on, with Russian forces keeping up their deadly and devastating strikes on civilian areas while making battlefield advances in Ukraine’s southeastern Zaporizhia region.

Russian drones hit residential areas of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, overnight, killing four people and wounding 13, including two children, authorities said.

On Monday, Russian forces struck the city of Pavlohrad in Ukraine’s Dnipropetrovsk region with drones, wounding three people and damaging industrial facilities, according to regional authorities.

That morning, Russian shelling killed a 61-year-old woman in Kherson, according to the military administration of the city in southern Ukraine.

Zelenskyy said on Monday that it was in Russia’s interests to disrupt the peace process and warned Ukrainians to pay particular attention to air raid alerts in the days and weeks to come “as we fully understand who we are dealing with”.

Across the border, Russian air defences downed Ukrainian drones en route to Moscow, forcing three airports serving the capital to pause flights.

Here are the numbers,"Since the ceasefire took effect, Israeli attacks have killed at least 312 Palestinians and injured 760.

Since the declaration of a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, on October 10, 2025, Israel has violated the agreement with near-daily attacks, killing hundreds of people.

Israel violated the ceasefire agreement at least 393 times from October 10 to November 20, through the continuation of attacks by air, artillery and direct shootings, the Government Media Office in Gaza reports.

The office said Israel shot at civilians 113 times, raided residential areas beyond the “yellow line” 17 times, bombed and shelled Gaza 174 times, and demolished people’s properties on 85 occasions. It added that Israel had also detained 35 Palestinians from Gaza over the past month.

Israel has also continued to block vital humanitarian aid and destroy homes and infrastructure across the Strip.

Al Jazeera has tracked the ceasefire violations to date.

What are the terms of the ceasefire?

On September 29, the United States unveiled a 20-point proposal to end Israel’s war on Gaza, release the remaining captives held in the enclave, allow the full entry of humanitarian aid into the besieged territory and outline a three-phase withdrawal of Israeli forces.

Some of the main conditions of the first phase, which is ongoing, include:

An end to hostilities in Gaza by Israel and Hamas

Lifting the blockade of all aid into Gaza by Israel and stopping its interference in aid distribution

Release of all captives held in Gaza – alive or dead – by Hamas

Release of some 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and disappeared people from Israeli jails

Withdrawal of Israeli forces to the “yellow line”

Following mediation by partners including Egypt, Qatar, and Turkiye, representatives from some 30 countries gathered on October 13 for a ceremony to sign the Gaza ceasefire agreement, led by US President Donald Trump.

However, Israel and Hamas were notably absent, raising doubts about the summit’s ability to achieve tangible progress towards ending the war and resolving the core issues of Israel’s occupation and the 18-year-long siege of Gaza.

Israel has pledged not to allow a Palestinian state, and the US has continued its large-scale arms transfers and diplomatic backing to Israel throughout its genocidal war on Gaza, while offering only vague statements about Gaza’s future.

Israel attacks Gaza nearly every day

According to an analysis by Al Jazeera, Israel has attacked Gaza on 35 out of the past 42 days of the ceasefire, meaning there were only eight days during which no violent attacks, deaths or injuries were reported.

Despite continuing attacks, the US insists that the “ceasefire” is still holding.

Israel still killing Palestinians

Since the ceasefire took effect at noon on October 10, Israel has killed at least 312Palestinians and injured 760, according to the latest figures from the Palestinian Ministry of Health.

On October 19 and 29 – two of the deadliest days since the latest ceasefire – Israel killed a total of 154 people.

On October 19, accusing Hamas of violating the ceasefire after two Israeli soldiers were killed in Rafah, Israeli forces killed 45 people in a massive wave of air raids across the Gaza Strip.

Hamas’s armed wing, the Qassam Brigades, pointed out that Israel controls the Rafah area and it had no contact with any Palestinian fighters there.

On October 29, Israel killed 109 people, including 52 children, after an exchange of gunfire in Rafah that killed one Israeli soldier.

“The Israelis hit back, and they should hit back,” Trump told reporters, calling Israel’s attacks “retribution” for the soldier’s death.

Here are the latest figures from the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza, tracking the casualties from October 7, 2023, through November 20, 2025:

Confirmed killed: at least 69,546 people, including 20,179 children

at least 69,546 people, including 20,179 children Injured: at least 170,833 people

Israel still choking aid

The ceasefire stipulated that “full aid will be immediately sent into the Gaza Strip”. However, the reality on the ground remains very different.

According to the World Food Programme (WFP), only half the required food aid is currently reaching Gaza, while a coalition of Palestinian relief agencies says total aid deliveries amount to just one-quarter of what was agreed under the ceasefire.

From October 10 to November 20, only 5,037 trucks have reached their intended destinations inside Gaza, according to the UN2720 Monitoring and Tracking Dashboard, which monitors humanitarian aid in Gaza.

According to truck drivers, aid deliveries are facing significant delays, with Israeli inspections taking much longer than expected.

The White House says nearly 15,000 trucks carrying commercial goods and humanitarian aid have entered Gaza since October 10 to November 9, a figure sharply disputed by Palestinians and aid groups.

In addition, Israel has blocked essential and nutritious food items, including meat, dairy, and vegetables crucial for a balanced diet. Instead, non-nutritious foodstuffs are being allowed, such as snacks, chocolate, crisps, and soft drinks.

Has Hamas released all of the captives?

On October 13, as per the ceasefire deal, Hamas released all 20 remaining living Israeli captives in exchange for 250 Palestinians serving long prison sentences and 1,700 Palestinians disappeared by Israel since October 7, 2023.

As part of the deal, Hamas is also expected to return the bodies of 28 Israeli captives in exchange for 360 Palestinian bodies held by Israel.

As of November 20, Hamas had returned 25 Israeli captives’ bodies, with three remaining in Gaza. The group has said it requires heavy excavation equipment to recover the remaining bodies buried under the rubble from Israeli bombardment.

Israel has so far returned more than 300 Palestinian bodies, many of which were mutilated and showed signs of torture. Many remain unidentified.

What does international law say about ceasefires?

According to the Lieber Institute, a ceasefire is designed to halt active combat, or “freeze a conflict in place”, but it can be ambiguous in international law.

The suspension of hostilities is best understood as a cessation of active hostile military operations.

Resuming hostilities would breach political agreements, but it might not be a violation of international law unless the ceasefire was part of a binding treaty or United Nations Security Council resolution.",2025-11-11 00:00:00,metaphor,Wave of used as metaphor for series or trend,metaphor,figurative,1,literal,0.9323027,0.06769732,0.9323027,False

Bangladesh has again asked India to extradite former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who was recently sentenced to death in absentia over last year’s deadly crackdown against a student-led uprising.

Touhid Hossain, who holds the foreign affairs portfolio in Bangladesh’s interim administration, on Sunday said Dhaka had sent a letter two days ago, urging New Delhi to hand over the fugitive ex-leader.

Hasina, 78, has been in hiding in India – her close ally when she was the prime minister of Bangladesh for 15 years, until her autocratic rule was overthrown in a mass uprising in August 2024, in which more than 1,400 people were killed, according to the United Nations.

On Monday, a special International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) in Dhaka convicted Hasina of crimes against humanity and sentenced her to death, fulfilling a key pledge by the interim government, led by Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus.

Following the court ruling, Bangladesh’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement that India had an “obligatory responsibility” under a bilateral extradition treaty signed in 2013 to facilitate the former leader’s return.

The ministry said keeping Hasina is a “grave act of unfriendly behaviour”, and called it “a travesty of justice for any other country to grant asylum to these individuals convicted of crimes against humanity”.

India’s Foreign Ministry responded by saying it had “noted” the Hasina verdict. But India has so far not commented on the prospects of her extradition. Bangladeshi newspaper Prothom Alo says Dhaka has made at least three such extradition requests so far.

India’s past support for Hasina has frayed relations between the two South Asian neighbours since her overthrow.

But tensions appear to have eased slightly this week after Bangladesh’s National Security Adviser Khalilur Rahman visited India for a regional security summit, where he also met his Indian counterpart, Ajit Doval.

Media reports in Bangladesh said Rahman has invited Doval for a visit.

Al Jazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/11/20/cop30-cannot-meet-the-1-5c-goal-while-military-emissions-stay-uncounted,COP30 cannot meet the 1.5C goal while military emissions stay uncounted,"As COP30 negotiations in Belem enter their final stretch, there is hope that countries might finally agree on a roadmap to phase out fossil fuels — a breakthrough that is crucial if we are serious about keeping 1.5C alive. Yet even at this pivotal moment, one major highway is still missing from that roadmap that could undermine the progress made in Brazil: the carbon emissions of the military.

Under the Paris Agreement, governments are not required to report their militaries’ emissions, and most simply don’t. Recent analysis by the Military Emissions Gap project shows that what little data exists is patchy, inconsistent or missing entirely. This “military emissions gap” is the gulf between what governments disclose and the true scale of military pollution. The result is stark: militaries remain largely invisible in the Belem negotiations, creating a dangerous blind spot in global climate action.

The size of that blind spot is staggering. Militaries account for an estimated 5.5 percent of global emissions. This share is set to rise further as defence spending surges while the rest of society decarbonises. If militaries were a country, they would be the fifth-largest emitter on Earth, ahead of Russia with 5 percent. Yet only five countries follow the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change’s (UNFCCC) voluntary reporting guidelines for military emissions, and those cover fuel use alone. The reality is far broader: munitions production and disposal, waste management and fugitive emissions from refrigeration, air-conditioning, radar and electrical equipment are left out. And operations in international waters and airspace are not reported at all, leaving massive gaps in both climate accountability and action.

The military emissions gap widens further still when we consider the climate impact of armed conflicts. As if the horror and human suffering from fighting wars were not enough, wars also destroy ecosystems, leave a toxic legacy on lands for decades to follow, and result in significant CO2 emissions, including from the rebuilding following the destruction of buildings and infrastructure. But without any internationally agreed framework to measure conflict emissions, these additional emissions risk going unreported, meaning that we don’t know how much wars are setting back climate action.

But despite this, momentum for accountability is finally building. Nearly 100 organisations have signed the War on Climate initiative’s pledges ahead of COP30, and protesters and civil society groups in Belem are demanding the UNFCCC confront this long-ignored source of pollution. Policymakers are starting to shift, too. The European Union has taken steps towards more transparent reporting and decarbonisation in the defence sector, though this progress is now threatened by rapid rearmament. Combined with NATO’s new target for members to spend 5 percent of gross domestic product on militaries, these pledges could produce up to 200 million tonnes of CO2 and trigger as much as $298bn in climate damages annually, putting Europe’s own climate goals at risk.

International law reinforces the urgency and demand for accountability. The International Court of Justice’s recent landmark advisory opinion reminded states that they are obliged under climate treaties to assess, report and mitigate harms, including those caused by armed conflict and military activity. Ignoring these emissions doesn’t just undercount global warming; it masks the scale of the crisis and weakens the world’s ability to tackle its root causes.

The gap between current emission-reduction plans and what is needed to stay below the 1.5C limit remains catastrophic. If COP30 negotiators agree on a roadmap for phasing out fossil fuels, what happens next will determine whether it delivers real progress or remains symbolic. No sector can be exempt from climate action, and military emissions cannot continue to remain hidden.

Mandatory reporting of all military emissions to the UNFCCC – from combat and training activities to the long-lasting climate damage inflicted on communities – is essential. That data must form the baseline for urgent, science-aligned reductions, embedded in national climate plans, and consistent with the 1.5C limit.

There are some people so endlessly inventive that it's almost impossible to imagine them getting writer's block. David Byrne is one of those people.

In 1975, Byrne, along with bassist Tina Weymouth and drummer Chris Frantz, founded Talking Heads — a band that was a trailblazer in the new wave scene and went on to release several highly influential albums. Byrne is also a prolific solo artist who follows his curiosity in every direction, from sound collage and film scores to theater and dance, including his recent Broadway show for his album American Utopia.

But before writing his new album, Who Is the Sky?, it finally happened: Byrne got writer's block.

In this session, Byrne talks about what happened, how he eventually started writing again, his joyful new album and the vibrant new stage show for his current tour.

Overcrowding, poor sanitation, a lack of food and a shortage of medicine have turned Gaza’s makeshift shelters into a breeding ground for infectious diseases.

“Even the minimum standards of human dignity and hygiene cannot be maintained under these conditions,” Samaher Saeed, Medical Aid for Palestine’s (MAP) protection manager in Gaza, tells Al Jazeera from southern Gaza.

“There's no stability, no safety,” Saeed adds, capturing the daily reality faced by displaced Palestinians.

What is life like inside a Gaza tent?

To understand just what living conditions are like in a tent in Gaza, Al Jazeera visited a camp in Deir el-Balah, the governorate with the highest number of active shelters.

The living space is divided into outdoor and indoor areas. The outdoor section serves multiple daily needs, including cooking meals over an open fire, washing dishes, hanging clothes and using the outdoor toilet, while the indoor area is primarily for sleeping and shelter from the sun or rain.

The tent’s shaded area measures 20 sqm (215sq ft) and is shared by an average of 10 people, giving each just 2sqm (22sq ft) of personal space, well below the UNHCR’s recommended minimum of 3.5sqm per person and 2 metres (6.5ft) height for proper ventilation.

The tent itself is built from old blankets and fabric scraps, with sheets of nylon held up with ropes and supported by metal and wooden poles. These materials offer minimal protection from rain, do little to ensure privacy, and fail to regulate temperatures during cold winters and hot summers.

“The tents that were set up early in the war have completely deteriorated after two years of use; they no longer protect people from shrapnel, the summer heat or the winter cold,” says Saeed.

Earlier reporting by Al Jazeera in Gaza describes a mother speaking of “a summer that has ravaged children’s bodies” and being “eaten by flies and insects” where the “tent environment is very miserable”.

In the corners of the tent, personal belongings are stored in sacks and cardboard boxes, while clothes are hung up to maximise space, allowing them to be quickly packed in the face of Israel’s constant forced expulsion orders and incessant bombings.

Kitchen space

Kitchen utensils, pots and pans are tucked away in another corner of the outdoor living space, while plastic containers store precious drinking water.

Just outside, an open fire is used for cooking, but it sits next to piles of rubbish, including cardboard and other materials to be used as fuel, releasing harmful smoke into the air and creating health risks.

Hundreds of thousands of tonnes of rubbish have built up near camps.

Israel has restricted access to Gaza's two main landfills, at Juhor ad-Dik in the north and al-Fukhari (also known as Sofa) in the south, where this rubbish would normally be taken.

As of February 2025, the continued denial of access to the Sofa landfill, located in the no-go zone, is preventing the transfer of solid waste from the 30 temporary dump sites and numerous persistent ad hoc sites.

“We often find ourselves in situations where we know that people are living in dangerous or undignified environments near sewage, waste dumps or unsafe shelters, but we simply have no alternative to offer them,” Saeed says.

Sleeping area

Sleeping arrangements are rough; the best people can hope for is to find a thin foam mattress to sleep on, but there isn't one for each family member, and many end up sleeping on the ground. Blankets and pillows are stowed away during the day.

Toilet facilities

With few functioning toilets, people are forced to dig latrines or use buckets. According to MAP, on average, up to 600 people are forced to share a single latrine, 30 times more than the minimum standards.

Sewage and human waste flow into streets and near shelters as a result.

Lack of sanitation and hygiene

Access to basic sanitation and hygiene remains severely limited in Gaza, particularly for women.

Wafaa Nasrallah, a displaced mother of two, cannot afford to buy sanitary pads and has tried using rags and even nappies.

She is one of many women who cannot access hygiene items, and some have resorted to taking medication to stop their menstrual cycles entirely.

Menstruating women and girls also do not have access to enough water to wash or privacy in bathroom facilities to enable them to do so, even if they find the water.

“Girls are sleeping on bare ground during their periods due to the lack of clean bedding or private space,” says Saeed.

Israel has rendered more than 85 percent of Gaza’s water and sanitation infrastructure inoperable, from wells to treatment facilities.

Disease spreading

Preventable diseases are spreading in the camps due to overcrowding, the lack of clean facilities and a lack of medication.

According to a Journal of Medicine, Surgery, and Public Health paper published in April, Gaza currently faces an enormous infectious disease caseload, with 700,000 officially reported cases.

Contaminated water sources will “propagate waterborne illnesses such as cholera and dysentery, exacerbating the public health crisis”, where poverty, overcrowding, inadequate hygiene, contaminated food and a lack of safe drinking water all serve as significant risk factors for cholera.",2025-10-29 00:00:00,literal,Factual reporting on reporting and political figures,literal,literal,0,literal,0.86641175,0.13358825,0.86641175,True

Taylor Swift has the top album and song in the country yet again, as The Life of a Showgirl and ""The Fate of Ophelia"" hold down the No. 1 spots for a sixth consecutive week. But even as sombr and Rosalía hit new career highs, there's a major churn taking place just below the top 10, as Mariah Carey, Wham! and their cheerful ilk gear up for yet another jingling assault on the charts.

TOP STORY

Last week, the Billboard charts absorbed the full force of spooky season, as a weekend of Halloween parties produced a Hot 100 full of scary-ish songs and a return to the top 10 for Michael Jackson's ""Thriller."" At the same time, a different holiday began its annual attack on the chart, as two Christmas classics — Mariah Carey's ""All I Want for Christmas Is You"" and Wham!'s ""Last Christmas"" — made an auspiciously early return.

A week later, ""Thriller"" and their ilk have been sent back to molder in their crypts once more, while Christmas streamers who couldn't wait for Thanksgiving (you know who you are) have gone ham — and not in the seasonally appropriate, honey-glazed way — on the Hot 100. We should consider it a small win that none of them crash the top 10, but with ""All I Want for Christmas Is You"" at No. 11 and ""Last Christmas"" at No. 13, we're merely delaying the inevitable here.

""All I Want for Christmas Is You"" came this close to thwarting a major career milestone: As ""Back to Friends"" ticks up a spot to No. 10, sombr has become just the 10th artist to hit the Hot 100's top 10 for the first time in 2025. Another would-be first-timer came close this week, as country star Cody Johnson debuts on this week's chart at No. 12 with his cover of ""Travelin' Soldier."" The track, written by Bruce Robison and popularized by the act known at the time as The Dixie Chicks, has become a signature song for Johnson; his 2022 performance of ""Travelin' Soldier"" has accumulated 59 million views on YouTube, and now it's got a studio version to match. But if he's going to hit the top 10 for the first time in his career — this is his eighth time hitting the Hot 100 — he's probably gonna have to wait until January.

TOP ALBUMS

The Hot 100 isn't the only major Billboard chart to welcome a first-timer to its top 10: Spanish polymath Rosalía, whose 2022 album Motomami peaked at No. 33, blows away that career high as Lux debuts at No. 4. For an album that expands her sound well beyond chart-friendly genres — she recorded it with the London Symphony Orchestra — Lux wasn't necessarily an easy sell as a pop hit. Future weeks will tell the full story, of course, as an initial sales burst gives way to word of mouth and what will likely be a tsunami of placements on ""Best Albums of 2025"" lists.

The other top 10 debut is also a first-timer, but with an asterisk: Yeonjun, a member of the K-pop boy band Tomorrow X Together, lands at No. 10 with his first solo effort, No Labels: Part 01. Tomorrow X Together is a frequent visitor to the top 10, but Yeonjun now has a hit of his own.

There's one other serious chart breakthrough worth noting this week: After months of teasing and leaked tracks — and after entering the Billboard 200 albums chart at No. 173 last week — Paramore's Hayley Williams makes a huge jump with her new solo record, Ego Death at a Bachelorette Party. Buoyed by an official release and the addition of two new tracks, the album zips all the way to No. 12.

TOP SONGS

""All I Want for Christmas Is You"" and ""Last Christmas"" are just two of the nine holiday songs in this week's top 50, and the order in which they appear is instructive. Because, while it might seem as if the exact same holiday songs appear on each year's charts in roughly the exact same order, it's possible to plot out incremental shifts in audience preferences, year over year.

For example, there was a moment when Brenda Lee's ""Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree"" seemed to be overtaking ""All I Want for Christmas Is You"" — roughly around the time the still-living Lee released a video in 2023 for her 1958 hit. But in the time since, ""Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree"" has ceded its chart dominance to Mariah Carey and Wham!. This week, Lee re-enters the Hot 100 at No. 19, so that pecking order looks to persist in 2025.

Bobby Helms' 1957 staple ""Jingle Bell Rock"" follows at No. 20, re-entering alongside its sibling in the microgenre of ""holiday songs that evoke rock and roll without actually rocking."" Next up are the two most recently minted holiday standards, both of which have climbed steadily in recent years: Ariana Grande's 2014 hit ""Santa Tell Me"" at No. 30 and, from 2013, Kelly Clarkson's ""Underneath the Tree"" at No. 41. Their strength, relative to other holiday hits, appears to be growing.

Then, rounding out this week's holiday selections — remember that old, previously charting songs can only re-enter the Hot 100 if they're in the top 50 — are two gelatinous slabs of moldy fruitcake (Andy Williams' ""It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year"" at No. 47 and Michael Bublé's ""It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas"" at No. 48) and one gleaming gem (Nat ""King"" Cole's ""The Christmas Song"" at No. 50).

Bublé's strength and momentum, year over year, is especially notable and alarming: The Canadian singer has yet to hit the Hot 100's top 10 in his career, but he looks extremely well-positioned to do so this time around. (He's also got this week's highest-charting holiday album: Christmas, at No. 25.)

And, because the charts are kind of inherently a zero-sum game, there's a whiff of bad news for the Ives Hive. Burl Ives has been a staple of the top 5 — as recently as December 2024 — with his 1964 recording of ""A Holly Jolly Christmas."" But, at least so far, it's absent from this year's initial chart flurries.

The Ives Dive can only be blamed on one Scroogey scourge: Michael freaking Bublé, whose own take on the song debuted at No. 37 at the very beginning of this year. If Bublé becomes the new literal standard-bearer where ""A Holly Jolly Christmas"" is concerned, then that's bad news for 1) the estate of Burl Ives; and 2) everyone with taste.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/nov/24/bad-omens-review-ovo-hydro-glasgow,Bad Omens review – anthemic songs and pillars of fire dampened by arena nerves,"Melodic metalcore band Bad Omens are pulling out all the stops for their first UK arena headline tour. In the first five minutes, we’ve experienced huge riffs, pillars of fire and supernatural horror-inspired visuals. Formed in 2015, the US band found mainstream success in 2022 with their third album The Death of Peace of Mind, which embraced the kind of hooky pop songwriting and complex storytelling that made the band irresistible on TikTok. Although their fourth studio album is yet to be released, this tour represents their graduation to the same league as genre titans Bring Me the Horizon, who they supported last year. Opener Specter is enough to justify this step up: an anthemic recent single as atmospheric as the dry ice crawling around frontman Noah Sebastian.

Although tonight’s set list is rooted in metal, it showcases the band’s ambitions towards other genres, incorporating elements of industrial, electronica and drum’n’bass. This fluid approach is anchored by Sebastian’s supremely adaptable vocals, which switch from croon to scream to whisper, even deftly mimicking the flow of metal princess Poppy during their collaborative single VAN. Dying to Love is pleasingly gothic, Nowhere to Go is relatively perky pop punk, and Impose finds commonality between breakbeats and double-kick metal drums. Drummer Nick Folio deserves a particular mention for balancing visceral crunch with expansive resonance. The band’s willingness to lean into zeitgeisty pop sounds is key to their mainstream appeal: The Death of Peace of Mind is reminiscent of the gloomy R&B of the Weeknd, by way of Bring Me the Horizon – all falsetto and moody beats with heavy metal drops.

This unabashedly big sound and anthemic songwriting is well suited to arenas – but Bad Omens themselves are not, at least not yet. They’re more like consummate professionals playing a good reproduction of what’s already on record; it might be big-venue nerves, or how spread out they are, but there’s a lack of connection on stage, like a star and his backing band rather than a group with chemistry. And a reluctant star at that: when Sebastian asks the audience if they’re having fun, he doesn’t seem to be having that much of it himself.",2025-11-24 00:00:00,literal,Straightforward news about legal matters,literal,literal,0,literal,0.9855623,0.01443761,0.9855623,True

Doug Jones launches Democratic bid for Alabama governor,"Former Sen. Doug Jones announced Monday that he has filed paperwork to run for governor of Alabama, setting the stage for a potential rematch with Republican Sen. Tommy Tuberville.

Jones announced his candidacy in a video on social media, saying he would officially kick off his campaign after the Thanksgiving holiday.

""In the meantime, what I know and what we have heard all along is Alabama wants their next governor to be someone who lives here, who works here, who listens to the people of this state, who understands the people of this state,"" Jones said in the video.

Gov. Kay Ivey, a Republican, cannot run again because of term limits.

Jones also made a thinly veiled reference to Tuberville, the top Republican candidate in the race, saying Alabamians are looking for a governor who ""treats this state with grace and dignity and not just like a rest stop on the way to the Florida beach.""

Tuberville, who launched his run for governor in May, has been dogged by questions about his residency in past campaigns amid revelations that he voted and owned property in Florida. Tuberville has insisted he is a full-time Alabama resident.

Tuberville, a former Auburn University football coach, defeated Jones by 20 percentage points in 2020, when Jones ran for a full Senate term. Jones, a former U.S. attorney, won a 2017 special Senate election in the deeply Republican state against former state Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore, who faced allegations of sexual misconduct with underage girls. Moore denied the allegations.

Jones is the latest Democrat to join the primary field, which includes educator Yolanda Flowers, who lost to Ivey by 38 points in 2022.

The race will be an uphill climb for any Democrat in the solidly Republican state. Tuberville has also been building up his campaign coffers, having ended October with $6.2 million in his campaign account, according to recent fundraising reports.",2025-11-24 22:57:53.484000+00:00,literal,Factual reporting on reporting and elections,literal,literal,0,literal,0.95679265,0.043207336,0.95679265,True

In western Sudan, the number of people fleeing el-Fasher and its surrounding villages in North Darfur in search of safety is rising.

As of Tuesday, the International Organization for Migration estimated that 81,817 people have been displaced in the area – most on foot – since the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) seized the city on October 26, ending an 18-month siege and driving out the Sudanese army.

Many of the displaced have sought refuge in different parts of el-Fasher, the capital of North Darfur State, and in the nearby town of Tawila.

Thousands of people inside the city are feared to have been killed since the RSF took control.

The United Nations and international aid agencies have confirmed numerous accounts from survivors reporting that RSF fighters have carried out mass executions, torture, rape and sexual abuse and have held people for ransom. Famine is spreading while outbreaks of cholera and other deadly diseases continue to rise.

More than 9.5 million people displaced

According to the UN, Sudan is facing the world’s largest humanitarian and displacement crisis with more than 9.5 million people internally displaced across 10,929 locations in 185 localities, spanning all 18 states of Sudan.

Most of the displaced have sought refuge in South Darfur (1.84 million), North Darfur (1.75 million) and Central Darfur (978,000). More than half, or 51 percent, of those displaced are children under the age of 18.

Sudan’s civil war between Sudan’s military and the RSF began on April 15, 2023, and both sides have been accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity. The RSF has also been implicated in atrocities in Darfur that the UN said may amount to genocide.

Even before the current war began, the International Organization for Migration estimated that more than 2.32 million people had already been displaced in Sudan, mostly in Darfur, due to years of conflict and climate-driven crises.

Since April 2023, an additional 7.25 million people have been displaced within Sudan, including around 2.7 million from Khartoum State, 2 million from South Darfur and a similar number from North Darfur.

More than 4.3 million refugees

In addition to 9.58 million internally displaced people, an estimated 4.34 million have fled to neighbouring countries as refugees, bringing the total number of displaced across Sudan to 14 million – more than a quarter of the country’s 51 million population.

Most have sought refuge in Egypt (1.5 million), South Sudan (1.25 million) and Chad (1.2 million).

The tragedy this week at Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis marked the first school shooting of the new school year. It's heartbreaking and outrageous to have to note that there will almost certainly be more. Education Week, which tracks shootings at K through 12 schools, says there were more than two dozen during the last school year.

Once again, we hear about children — children — crying and scrambling to try to protect one another in a place where they should be safe. We sputter for words that have become dulled from repetition — like ""tragic,"" ""heartbreaking,"" and ""outrageous"" — because, as Minnesota's Governor Tim Walz said this week at one of the press conferences of grim-faced public officials, ""There shouldn't be words for these types of incidents since they should not happen.""

But it has come to happen over and over in America. Children run for their lives from classrooms and playgrounds. Reporters write obituaries remembering youngsters who had just begun to live. We offer prayers, thoughts, and vows that such an abominable crime must never happen again. And then it does.

Those inside the church Wednesday morning were at prayer to begin the school day. Matthew DeBoer, the principal of Annunciation Catholic School, told a press conference that he'd planned for this school year's theme to come from the Book of Jeremiah: ""a future filled with hope.""

""There's nothing that happened today that can fill us with hope,"" the principal said. ""We lost two angels today…""

""We can't change the past,"" he said. ""But we can do something about the future. There's an African proverb that says, 'When you pray, move your feet.'… So I beg you, and I ask you to please pray, but don't stop with your words. Let's make a difference and support this community, these children, these families and teachers, never again can we let this happen.""

Archbishop Bernard Hebda spoke next. As he addressed reporters, the church bell began ringing to mark the hour.

""The bell in the Catholic church is always a call to prayer,"" said the Archbishop, ""so it's a reminder for us for sure to be praying. And we have to recognize that it's through prayer and through that prayer of the feet, through that action, that we can indeed make a difference. That has to be the source of our hope.""",2025-08-30 00:00:00,irony,"Ironic quotes around ""a future filled with hope."" with negative context",irony,figurative,1,figurative,0.27833372,0.7216662,0.7216662,True
The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/24/young-men-democrats-us-elections,Why did young men move left in this month’s US elections? | Cory Alpert,"Just a few months ago, it seemed that the political landscape was changing permanently, with young people shifting right – especially young men. Democrats spun up a vortex of efforts to win them back, but they often appeared to be flailing. This month’s elections, however, told a different story.

Young men in the US face a political identity crisis. It should not be controversial to say that the world that many were promised as children has not come to fruition. Two decades of war and a turbulent economy have combined with a massively changing workforce. Young men’s disaffection should come as no real surprise.

An entire ecosystem of hucksters has emerged to take advantage of these young people, peddling a dark vision that offers violence and control as a response to a changing world. Meanwhile, the Democratic party failed to imagine a political future that included these young men. In Democrats’ parlance, anyone who took one step in that direction was hopelessly lost, unable to see the beautiful egalitarian future that we could create together.

There is a fine line here. I am not arguing for the redemption, welcome, or whitewashing of the people who have peddled this bleak reality. But we can and should build a political coalition that includes this generation, that doesn’t leave them out in the cold, only to find a home in the most bleak fringes of a political movement that tells them that a lust for control over other people, especially women, is the only way to find meaning.

On the left, we tell ourselves the story of our own vaunted sympathy, and yet we assign only blame to the young men who do something similar, looking for community and only finding it among the most opportunistic and dangerous political movements. We have done little to welcome them in.

And while Democrats had solid policies and economic plans, Republicans, backed by an army of digital content, were able to take the mantle of running on the economy and framing the left as cultural warriors out of touch with the majority of Americans.

But the good news is that this month’s elections in Virginia, New Jersey and New York City show Democrats have learned a lesson.

The three marquee campaigns of this year were all remarkably similar, despite coming from different parts of the ideological spectrum. Their messaging was relentlessly focused on affordability – how expensive and difficult life has become for the working and middle-class people of their communities. Their solutions covered a wide ideological range, but the focus remained the same.

Most young men, like most trans people and Black people and immigrants and everyone else, are dealing with housing that has skyrocketed in price, especially compared with our parents’ generations. Instead of having one career in our lifetimes, we now have to continually seek new jobs. Living independently as an adult is much more expensive and complicated now than it has been. These affordability campaigns gave young men something to do about those pressures rather than ceding that frustration to the most cynical actors.

Undoubtedly this conversation is easier to have when Donald Trump is taking three steps every day to dismantle the economy. There’s a real sense that the economy is getting worse. That it’s more difficult to pay bills and keep food on the table, especially when Republicans are, quite literally, ensuring that 42 million people cannot afford to keep food on their table by refusing to fund Snap during their government shutdown.

Republicans got distracted, trying to defend Trump and also trying to repeat his playbook of tying Democrats to the culture war of the moment. But without Trump’s singular ability to control a media narrative, Republicans with far less political talent and capital floundered, making themselves look weak and silly in the process.

The political miracle is that this ruthless focus on affordability and cost of living may have brought in many of those same young men who had followed Trump a year ago. In Virginia and New Jersey, men under 30 broke for their new Democratic governors, with about six in 10 supporting Spanberger, according to the AP. In New York, young men went for Zohran Mamdani over Andrew Cuomo by a margin of nearly 40 points, according to a Tufts Circle analysis.

It turns out that these young men are not completely lost to us. We just failed to imagine a reality where they could be in our camp.

Affordability broke through amid the longest government shutdown in US history, as consumer prices were rising ever higher thanks in part to Trump’s tariffs. For all of his bluster, eventually the economic reality becomes an unavoidable political crisis for anyone not far gone in his cult of personality who has to pay their bills.

Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey, Abigail Spanberger in Virginia, and Mamdani in New York City showed us that the frustration that every working and middle-class person feels could be directed into a political coalition that sees marginalized people as people also affected by the greed and corruption that has made life unaffordable for so many.

Young men, like everyone else, are looking for a politics that can make life a little better. Democrats are finally figuring out how to offer them that chance.",2025-11-24 00:00:00,literal,Factual reporting on reporting and policy,literal,literal,0,figurative,0.1464866,0.8535134,0.8535134,False

The Senior League World Series championship, for Little Leaguers ages 13 to 16 from all over the world, is played today in Easly, South Carolina. But the Cacique Mara team from Maracaibo, Venezuela couldn't compete. They won the Latin American qualifier rounds in Mexico last month, but were denied travel visas to the United States.

President Trump signed a proclamation in June to ban or partly ban citizens from 19 countries including Afghanistan, Cuba, Iran, and Venezuela from entering the U.S. for national security concerns. But there were exemptions for athletes participating in the World Cup, the Olympics, or other major sporting events as determined by the secretary of state.

It is not clear why an immigration officer denied travel visas to this team of Venezuelan youngsters. A State Department spokesperson told us, they have ""a policy to grant national interest exceptions to qualified travelers participating in these types of sporting events on a case-by-case basis. Due to the additional processing time required, we recommend that applicants apply well in advance of their anticipated travel date.""

Of course, a baseball team playing in a championship tournament can't apply for a visa until they've won a spot in that tournament.

Kendry Gutiérrez, president of the Cacique Mara Little League, said in a statement that his players are ""...demoralized. All they know how to do is play baseball. They don't represent any threat; they are 15-year-old kids who want to win the World Cup.""

Not allowing this group of young athletes to come to the U.S. for a major sporting event raises some questions:

Will Iran's excellent national soccer team really be permitted to play 2026 World Cup soccer games in the US? Will athletes from Iran, Cuba, Venezuela and other listed countries really be given visas to compete at the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles?

Two other Little League teams from Venezuela, one from Valencia, another from Barquisimeto, were granted visas.

International sports competitions are often saluted for promoting respect across all boundaries. And so the decision not to give visas to these teenagers from Cacique Mara is hard to understand.

Offer Vince Shlomi, the once-prominent infomercial pitchman, is running for Congress in Texas, according to a filing with the state's Republican Party.

Shlomi is running for the seat held by Republican Rep. John Carter, 84, who has served more than two decades in Congress. Carter announced earlier this month he'd run for re-election, so Shlomi has an uphill battle against an entrenched incumbent.

The former pitchman, best known for his role selling the ""ShamWow"" towel, told Fox News that he wants to ""destroy wokeism"" in Congress and that he's been motivated by the ""political infighting in the country"" to run and ""make America happy.""

In 2009, Shlomi was arrested on suspicion of battery after a fight with a woman, who was also arrested. Prosecutors declined to press charges. Shlomi told NBC News in an interview for a 2013 article that he takes ""full responsibility"" for his actions and that he would cut down on partying.

NBC News Think,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/novo-nordisk-says-alzheimers-drug-trial-older-glp-1-drug-fails-rcna245601,Novo Nordisk says Alzheimer's trial with older GLP-1 drug fails,"Novo Nordisk said on Monday an older oral version of its semaglutide drug failed to meet its main goal in late-stage trials testing whether the medicine can slow cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s patients, sending its share price down 10%.

The setback is a blow to hopes that Alzheimer’s could open a major new market for GLP-1 medicines such as semaglutide, as Novo faces rising competition to its blockbuster drugs in its core treatment areas of obesity and diabetes.

Alzheimer’s patients currently have limited treatment options. Novo's trial was being closely watched as an indication about whether GLP-1 drugs — used by millions for diabetes and weight loss — might slow disease progress.

The drug tested was Rybelsus, a pill approved only for type 2 diabetes. Like Novo’s blockbusters Ozempic and Wegovy, it contains semaglutide.

‘Lottery ticket’ fails to win

The company’s Executive Vice President for Product and Portfolio Strategy, Ludovic Helfgott, had described the Alzheimer’s trials as a “lottery ticket” in September, a reference to its uncertain prospects yet huge potential.

Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias affect more than 55 million people globally. There is no cure.

“While semaglutide did not demonstrate efficacy in slowing the progression of Alzheimer’s disease, the extensive body of evidence supporting semaglutide continues to provide benefits for individuals with Type 2 diabetes, obesity, and related comorbidities,” Chief Scientific Officer Martin Holst Lange said in a statement.

The results from the two trials of early-stage patients, called EVOKE and EVOKE+, are another setback for the Danish drugmaker and new CEO Mike Doustdar, which had seen booming success, driven by Ozempic and Wegovy, before slowing sales growth and a tumbling share price prompted a CEO change and mass layoffs.

The setback reinforces analyst skepticism about Novo‘s Alzheimer’s ambitions, with UBS having estimated just a 10% probability of success.

Participants aged 55 to 85

The trials, covering a combined 3,808 patients, were the first large trials for patients with early stage Alzheimer’s and Rybelsus.

The trials used a ratings system to assess clinical changes in areas such as memory and how patients were able to care for themselves over a two-year period. The studies aimed for a 20% slowing of cognitive decline, trial details show.

Doustdar, who took over as CEO in August, is restructuring the company to compete with Eli Lilly.

Wall Street analysts viewed the trials as high-risk, high-reward, and had said the data would determine if Novo’s Alzheimer’s program could become a future growth driver.

Treatments launched in the past several years by companies including Eli Lilly and an Eisai-Biogen partnership are the first drugs ever shown to slow cognitive decline in people with Alzheimer’s after years of failed trials, but they require infusions or injections and can cause significant side effects.",2025-11-24 13:55:28.330000+00:00,literal,Factual reporting on data and economics,literal,literal,0,literal,0.91056806,0.08943198,0.91056806,True
The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/nov/20/oneohtrix-point-never-tranquilizer-review-uncanny-ambient-music-for-an-agitated-era,Oneohtrix Point Never: Tranquilizer review – uncanny ambient music for an agitated era,"It should come as no surprise that the new album by Oneohtrix Point Never comes with a concept attached. They usually do. When not composing film soundtracks, or producing an eclectic range of other artists – the Weeknd, Anohni, Charli xcx, Soccer Mommy – Daniel Lopatin has released a string of acclaimed works, each with their own overarching idea.

The “hyperreal world music” of 2010’s Returnal was inspired by the fact that people now see more of the world than ever without actually leaving their homes. In 2015, Garden of Delete had an accompanying origin story about an adolescent humanoid alien called Ezra; 2018’s Age Of imagined artificial intelligence attempting to recreate human culture after humans themselves had been rendered extinct. Lopatin also has an all-consuming obsession with nostalgia and forgotten pop cultural artefacts: he’s made albums based around warped loops of 80s pop hits, preset sounds on obsolete synthesisers and recordings of US radio stations changing formats, discarding the musical genres in which they previously specialised in favour of the current vogue.

View image in fullscreen The artwork for Tranquilizer. Photograph: Warp Records

All of which makes Tranquilizer very much in the Oneohtrix Point Never wheelhouse. It feels not unlike a sequel to Replica, released 14 years ago. On that album, Lopatin drew on sounds from a collection of bootleg DVDs he bought online compiling old TV adverts from the 80s and 90s. Tranquilizer is constructed from a cache of old sample CDs – pre-packaged collections of royalty-free sounds that used to be sold to musicians and producers in the 90s and early 00s – that Lopatin found uploaded to the Internet Archive. An extra frisson came when, after bookmarking the page for future use, he discovered that it had been deleted. It subsequently reappeared, but it underlined the shakiness of the assumption that everything is preserved for ever in some corner of cyberspace.

There was something disorienting about the music on Replica, not least its use of minute snatches of spoken word: you’d hear the intake of breath and the first syllable of a voiceover, but the rest of the sentence would never appear, just a tiny fragment of its opening, looping or juddering. There’s something similarly unsettled about Tranquilizer. Sample CDs were frequently compiled along genre lines, labelled for use in drum’n’bass, or hip-hop, or house: from the start, the sounds on Tranquilizer strongly suggest that the CDs Lopatin downloaded were intended for those making ambient or new age music. For Residue opens with the sound of the ocean, some big, Pink Floyd-y guitar chords, wordless breathy vocals and thick, warm electronic tones. Elsewhere, you hear such obvious 90s ambient signifiers as tinkling windchime-like tones, Satie-esque piano figures, slow-paced non-specific “tribal” drums, the crackle of old vinyl and snatches of muted trumpet that recall the sound of late Brian Eno collaborator Jon Hassell. The synthesisers at the end of Modern Lust, meanwhile, are a dead ringer for those used on the KLF’s landmark album Chill Out.

Oneohtrix Point Never: Dis – video

Despite its title, Tranquilizer never feels particularly recumbent. Rather, it lulls the listener into a false sense of security with the familiarity of its sounds, then throws you for a loop. Sometimes the effect is straightforwardly unsettling, as when the patterns of the sounds on Bumpy run jarringly out of time, like a stuck record, or abruptly switch and change on Vestigel; or bend in pitch, lending a sickly, lightheaded air to Lifeworld. Sometimes the effect is overwhelming and euphoric: the shift during Rodl Glide, where a slow ooze of sound is dramatically replaced by full-on rave dynamics, or the sudden eruption of chattering synths midway through Dis. (In a startlingly Proustian period detail for listeners of a certain age, the track is also disrupted by the sound of speaker interference caused by an old 2G mobile phone.) Over five and half minutes, closer Waterfalls moves from windswept empty landscapes to busy urban propulsion, from passages that sound like the Japanese new age music collected on Visible Cloaks’ celebrated 2010 mix series Fairlights, Mallets and Bamboo to a burst of something that resembles an early 80s kids TV theme: the effect is heady and exhausting rather than relaxing.

For all the calm its source material was ostensibly intended to provoke, the record spends an hour in constant, agitated motion: chillout music transposed into an era where it’s increasingly difficult to chill out, where the constant bombardment of content and the dopamine hit of doomscrolling has made relaxing something we have to work at. Tranquilizer seems unlikely to help you calm down. It’s too kaleidoscopic and restless, too crammed with sounds: an album that demands – and repays – your full attention, rather than simply drifting by.

By the time Ozzy Osbourne died this week at the age of 76, he'd shown that people's lives can have second acts — and more.

He had a rough childhood in Birmingham, England, left school at 15, worked odd jobs, including at a slaughterhouse, then was arrested for robbing a store, and spent six weeks in prison.

Yet Ozzy Osbourne could sing. He became a founding member of Black Sabbath, one of the bands that invented heavy metal music. But the band let him go in 1979 for often being drunk, or strung out on drugs.

Imagine how much drug and drink you'd have to do to get thrown out of a heavy metal band that had songs about drugs, like ""Snowblind"" and ""Sweet Leaf.""

Ozzy Osbourne then struck off on a solo career, and would sell more than 100 million albums.

But he persisted with drugs, drink, and a recklessness that shouldn't be just laughed off. He bit the head off a dove while signing a record deal in Los Angeles. He famously bit the head of a bat that was thrown onstage at him in Des Moines.

Ozzy canceled shows, or performed in a stupor, and sometimes attacked his bandmates. He once had a slash, as they say in British pubs, on a monument to those who died at the Alamo. He snorted a line of ants with Mötley Crüe. There are many other stories. He went into rehab programs, stopped, started, and stopped all over again.

Then, in the 2000s, Ozzy Osbourne became a hit on cable television: The Osbournes was an MTV reality series about the domestic life of his family. A performer once proclaimed as 'The Prince of Darkness' reappeared as a slightly daft and bumbling, burrito-loving suburban dad, albeit with an f-bomb charged vocabulary.

This week Alice Cooper, a founder of shock-rock, wrote on Instagram, ""I always saw Ozzy as a cross between the prince of darkness, which is the persona his fans saw, and the court jester. That was the side that his family and friends saw.""

And just last month, even as he struggled with Parkinson's, Ozzy Osbourne reunited with his Black Sabbath mates for a last show in Birmingham.

And he sang in one of their last songs:

""Yes, I've been a bad guy

Been higher than the blue sky

And the truth is I don't wanna die an ordinary man.""

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/24/donald-trump-peace-plan-kremlin-ukraine#comments,Trump’s ‘peace plan’ was a pro-Kremlin abomination whose failure is a glimmer of hope for Ukraine | Rajan Menon,"The US president, Donald Trump, has said “something good just may be happening” at the talks in Switzerland intended to end the war in Ukraine. European and Ukrainian negotiators have been attempting to “rework” the 28-point peace plan that the president put forward last week into one more favourable to Ukraine. Trump keeps signalling that he is willing to compromise, but his original plan put Ukraine in a very tough starting position, handing Vladimir Putin concessions that Russia has so far failed to gain on the battlefield.

It is true Russia has made recent advances – especially around Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad in Donetsk province, and in parts of Zaporizhzhia. And Ukraine lacks the troops and firepower to retake all the territory lost since 2022, let alone Crimea. But the Ukrainian army isn’t about to unravel, and neither is Putin close to fulfilling his original objective: conquering the four Ukrainian provinces of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. Russia fully controls only Luhansk. This war could drag on until the summer. By then, Putin’s forces will have fought Ukraine for as long as Stalin’s fought Nazi Germany.

Ukraine’s shortages are well known: too few soldiers to hold an 800-mile contact line and inadequate air defences after Trump severely cut direct US military assistance. Europe’s stepped-up support hasn’t compensated. What is remarkable, given Ukraine’s disadvantages, is the scale of Russia’s losses: more than 1 million casualties according to the UK Ministry of Defence, nearly 150,000 confirmed dead, and more than 23,000 pieces of equipment destroyed or damaged. Ukrainian deep strikes on Russian refineries – at least 17 by mid-November – have caused fuel shortages, long lines at petrol stations, panic buying, higher prices, rationing and a cut in refining capacity by up to a fifth.

It is in this context that Trump unveiled his peace plan – an early Christmas present for Putin. It was negotiated by Kirill Dmitriev, a Putin confidant and CEO of Russia’s $10bn sovereign wealth fund, and on the US side by Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner. The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, seems to have played a minimal role.

Witkoff and Kushner may be shrewd business negotiators, but they have scant diplomatic experience and even less knowledge of Ukraine. (Witkoff has recited Kremlin talking points after meeting Putin.) Their influence stems largely from personal ties to Trump. Pitting them against someone like Dmitriev virtually guaranteed a deal tilted toward Russia. A few examples illustrate the imbalance:

Ukraine – not Russia – is required to cap its armed forces at 600,000. Russia faces no comparable constraints.

Ukraine must amend its constitution to drop its commitment to joining Nato.

Russia had long expressed concerns about Nato expansion; President Boris Yeltsin objected in the mid-1990s, well before Putin took the helm. But acknowledging Russia’s concerns is different from claiming Ukraine’s Nato membership was imminent in 2022. Between Nato’s 2008 Bucharest summit – where it vaguely promised eventual membership – and the invasion, Ukraine made no concrete progress toward accession. Had Nato truly wanted Ukraine in, it could have moved swiftly, as it did with Finland and Sweden.

And that’s only the beginning. Trump’s plan recognises Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk as de-facto Russian – granting Putin parts of Donetsk he hasn’t captured. It freezes battle lines, allowing Russia to retain territory seized in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. The plan doesn’t give Putin everything, but it gives him enough to claim victory.

What does Russia concede? Virtually nothing. The plan does say frozen Russian assets will help rebuild Ukraine, but Moscow was never going to recover that money anyway.

Meanwhile, Russia receives further rewards: readmission to the G8; reintegration into the global economy; negotiations toward a staged lifting of sanctions; and cooperation with the US on energy, infrastructure, AI and rare earths. The plan also demands Ukrainian de-Nazification, validating Russia’s absurd narrative that Ukraine is riddled with Nazis – something any visitor can see is false.

Despite Russia’s ongoing war crimes – atrocities in Bucha, Irpin and Borodianka; forced relocations to Russia of children; repeated strikes on apartment buildings, most recently in the western city of Ternopil; and abuse, torture, and execution of Ukrainian prisoners of war – the plan grants the Kremlin full immunity from prosecution, negating international criminal court warrants for Putin and his top officials.

None of this should be surprising. Trump has been open about his admiration for Putin. He has been disdainful toward Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He has even blamed Zelenskyy for starting the war.

Some commentators, echoing Trump, argue that Ukraine’s war is futile and not a vital US interest. But that hardly justifies forcing Ukraine to accept a one-sided deal crafted without its participation – and accompanied by an ultimatum of mere days.

Other supporters of the plan insist, as Trump has, that it’s time to end the blood-letting, even as Israel’s strikes in Gaza continue during the ceasefire underwritten by Trump. Some who rightly criticise Israel’s conduct seem oddly indifferent to Russia’s war crimes.

Trump certainly has the authority to halt weapons deliveries to Ukraine – his decision to do so was another boon for Putin. But he has gone far further. By concocting a plan that may as well have been written in the Kremlin and excluding Ukraine from negotiations, he hasn’t just put his thumb on the scale. He’s put his hand on it. That’s morally indefensible and strategically myopic.

There is some positive news. After reports that Rubio told members of Congress the 28-point plan was produced by Russia, he held talks with Andriy Yermak, Zelenskyy’s closest adviser, to rework it based on Ukraine’s reactions – although Rubio has denied this. Trump accused Ukraine of ingratitude but added that the plan was “not my final offer” and that his deadline could be extended. If the upshot of all this is that Trump’s proposal doesn’t fly, that will be a good thing – above all for Ukraine.",2025-11-24 00:00:00,metaphor,Battle lines used as metaphor for conflict positions,metaphor,figurative,1,literal,0.8684892,0.13151081,0.8684892,False
NBC News Think,https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-hoka-walking-shoes-review-rcna172789,We Tried the Best Hoka Walking Shoes of 2025,"I’ve been reporting about sneakers for over five years, and during almost every conversation I have with podiatrists, shoe buyers and athletes, Hoka comes up. The brand only launched about 15 years ago, but it’s quickly become a household name. It offers highly cushioned shoes that can support your feet whether you’re running a marathon or standing all day, but what about while walking?

To answer that question, I coordinated three months of testing among the NBC Select staff, who wore different Hoka sneakers and reported their findings. Here’s everything we learned about the best Hoka walking shoes.

Methodology

Before our testing period, I interviewed two experts — Dr. Anne Sharkey, a podiatrist at the North Austin Foot and Ankle Institute, and Jewels Busenberg, a senior buyer at Zappos — about what makes Hoka’s shoes distinct, factors to pay attention to while wearing them and which models are typically the best for walking. (Ed’s note: The inclusion of products sold by Zappos in this article was made independently of Busenberg.) With their guidance, I put together a list of five Hoka shoes for eight NBC Select staff members to test.

Hoka gifted our team courtesy samples, and two staff members tested each sneaker. Where possible, one person tested a women’s size and one person tested a men’s size for each shoe. We tested each Hoka sneaker for three months. We wore them indoors on treadmills and outdoors on pavement and trails for varying amounts of time.

How we tested Hoka walking shoes

While testing Hoka walking shoes, we considered the following factors:

Activity: We wore each sneaker while walking varying distances and for varying periods. We wore them for exercise and leisure, including commuting around New York City.

Arch support : There are two main categories that shoes fall into: cushioning shoes and stability shoes. Cushioning shoes are best for people with high arches because their feet need help absorbing shock, says Sharkey. On the other hand, stability shoes are ideal for people with flat feet because they’re designed with features that help prevent overpronation, she says. Some shoes fall between cushioning and stability — they’re typically best for those with neutral arches. We evaluated how well our sneakers aligned with our arch type and evaluated overall support.

Fit: We wore Hoka walking shoes in our typical sneaker sizes. During the testing period, we noted whether our shoes felt big, small or true to size. We also evaluated fit by making sure there was a thumbs width of space between the front of our shoe and our longest toe to account for potential swelling, especially at night, per Sharkey’s recommendation. We also noted whether any part of the shoes rubbed against our feet, and whether our heels slipped at all while walking, which should not happen with a properly fitted sneaker, says Busenberg.

The best Hoka walking shoes

All the Hoka walking shoes we tested and recommend below are available in men’s and women’s sizes, as well as standard and wide widths. Some earned the American Podiatric Medical Association’s Seal of Acceptance — I noted which ones.

Among other features, the Hoka’s website specifies each shoe’s stability and cushioning level, which I included below. Hoka breaks stability level into three categories, from least to most stabilizing: neutral, moderate and stable. It also breaks cushioning level into three categories, from the least/firmest to the most/softest: responsive, balanced and plush. I also listed each shoe’s heel drop, which is the difference in height between the heel and toe, and heel stack height, which is the amount of material between your heel and the ground. Heel stack height tends to be the thickest part of the shoe.

Best max cushioning

The Bondi 9 is one of the most easy-to-identify Hoka sneakers due to its thick cushioning in the midsole, the brand’s signature feature. There’s also extra foam in the heel area, giving it a billowed shape that acts as a crash pad every time you take a step. It absorbs the majority of shock when your foot meets the ground so you don’t feel it elsewhere, which is ideal for those who have high arches. With all this foam, however, comes extra weight. “They’re somewhere in between light and heavy,” says Jordan Bowman, NBC Select commerce editor, who wore the sneakers to walk his dog multiple times daily. “But overall, they didn’t weigh me down at all.”

Since the Bondi 9s are so highly cushioned, they lift you off the ground by a few inches, which, at times, made Bowman tip his body forward. He also wasn’t always able to feel the road beneath him. That’s typically par for the course with a true max cushioning shoe, so if you’re interested in this one from Hoka, be prepared. “These shoes feel like a cloud, and I found them to be incredibly comfortable,” says Bowman. “They supported my feet, ankles and neutral arches well, too.”

Best for long distances

The Hoka Gaviota 5 is a stability shoe designed with the brand’s H-frame, an H-shaped piece of foam that goes all the way around the sneaker and crosses through the center. The H-frame helps reduce overpronation, meaning the ankle tilting too far inward, while holistically stabilizing the entire foot, so it’s best for those with flat and neutral arches, according to the brand.

Lindsay Schneider, NBC Select commerce editor, prominently felt the foam around the edges of the shoe, which was sometimes uncomfortable for her ankles since she has higher arches. Still, she says the Gaviota 5s are objectively comfortable. “They’re really cushioned — you don’t feel every nook and cranny on the ground underneath you as you walk,” says Schneider. Bianca Alvarez, former NBC Select associate reporter, who has neutral arches, found the foam evenly distributed and supportive. “I wore these sneakers while walking around New York City and logged 18,634 steps in one day,” she says. “My feet weren’t aching at all and I never felt unstable.” Alvarez also says that while the Gaviota 5s aren’t super lightweight, they’re not heavy to the point where moving feels like a chore.

Alvarez says these Hokas never make her feel unstable and are lightweight. Courtesy Bianca Alvarez

Best for everyday wear

These sneakers are the most un-Hoka-like Hokas Rebecca Rodriguez, NBC Select editorial projects manager, and I have ever worn. They’re not highly cushioned, don’t give you much of a lift and lack the cushy feel most people expect from the brand — and that’s exactly why we love them. “They feel like a firm mattress that’s supportive in all the right places,” says Rodriguez. “They’re very comfortable and never hurt my feet, especially after a long day of walking around in them.” The Transports’ toe box is also on the wider side and never bothered Rodriguez’s bunion.

The Hoka Transports are a lifestyle shoe, meaning they’re designed for everyday wear rather than exercise. I throw them on to walk around New York City leisurely or run errands. One of my favorite features is the sneakers’ elastic laces. Instead of tying them, you pull a toggle to tighten or loosen the shoe. However, the shoes come with standard laces, so you can swap out the elastic ones if you don’t like them. The Transports also have a 3D grip pattern that adds traction, which I found helpful while walking on trails.

Best overall

If you’re looking for a Goldilocks walking shoe — meaning one that has just the right amount of everything — this is it. The Clifton 10 is a no-frills sneaker that reliably supports my neutral arches whether I'm exercising or commuting. Its overall construction is near-identical to its predecessor, the Clifton 9, which I've also tested. But the new model has a thicker, softer and more stable layer of plush cushioning, giving it a smoother feel on surfaces like trails and pavement.

I typically walk about five miles in these shoes each time I wear them. In addition to a gentle rocker outsole that keeps me moving forward at whatever pace I set, they have great traction and controlled bounce. The foam also sufficiently cushions my feet so they never feel tired, but it’s not so soft that I’m sinking into it. The sneakers have a roomy toe box and fit true-to-size, in my experience.

Best stability shoe

From the moment NBC Select SEO editor Nikki Brown put the Hoka Arahis on, she found them comfortable. That's partially because these sneakers, like the Gaviotas, have an H-frame to keep the feet and ankles steady with each step. “I have very, very flat feet that curve inward, and I love the high level of arch support in this sneaker,” says Brown. “They have a decent amount of stability and I felt grounded in them.” She wore her Arahis while on long walks, commuting to work and running errands, noting that they didn’t require a break-in period. I agree — I walked over 25,000 steps the first time I wore these shoes and they never made my feet sore or felt like I needed to stretch them out.

Mili Godio, NBC Select updates editor, tested the Arahis, too, walking outdoors and indoors on the treadmill. She didn’t find them as comfortable as Brown and I because she has a higher arch, but she still appreciated their firm, supportive cushioning. “They’re very light without feeling flimsy,” says Godio. “I found myself seamlessly springing forward while walking.”

What’s so great about Hoka sneakers?

Since its inception, one factor has made Hoka’s sneakers distinct: a thick cushioned midsole. “Hoka created the max cushion trend,” says Busenberg. The brand’s shoes are designed with lightweight, highly responsive foam, meaning it compresses to soften landings and absorb shock, then bounces back to spring you forward whether you’re walking, running or standing for long periods of time, says Sharkey. And while the overall feel of the foam — be it firm, plush or somewhere in the middle— varies by shoe, the thick midsole is typically a guarantee.

Despite highly cushioned sneakers being trendy, some shoppers are on the fence. “There’s a view among some that the thicker the shoe, the more geriatric-looking it is,” says Sharkey. “Some people just find them clunky.” But once someone tries on a pair of Hokas and experiences their responsiveness, it can change their perspective. “People put on Hoka’s sneakers and they feel really good,” says Sharkey. “They stop caring what the shoes look like and grow willing to wear them due to the feel.”

Compared to brands like Brooks, Nike and New Balance, which have been around since 1914, 1964 and 1906, respectively, Hoka is a newer brand. It was founded in 2009, so it’s only about 15 years old. But in that short period, it’s become popular because it's attractive to so many communities. “Hoka is able to tap into all markets, from healthcare workers that are on their feet all day, to trendy celebrities, to elite long distance runners,” says Busenberg. The brand has even prompted its competitors to release their own shoes with thick cushioned midsoles, like Brooks with its Ghost Max and Glycerin Max sneakers, Saucony with its Hurricane 24 sneakers and Asics with its Gel-Nimbus 26, says Sharkey.

Two other factors make Hoka’s sneakers stand out: its MetaRocker technology and Active Foot Frame.

The MetaRocker is a curved outsole that rolls you forward to some degree and supports smooth, efficient heel-to-toe transitions, says Busenberg. “The brand increases and decreases the amount of MetaRocker in each shoe depending on the goal,” she says. “The faster the transition, the more “rocker” the shoe will have. On the contrary, if the shoe is meant to provide more stability and ground coverage, it will have a less curved MetaRocker.”

The Active Foot Frame hugs the perimeter of your foot to stabilize it. The frame in a more stabilizing shoe has higher walls, while the frame in a less stabilizing shoe has lower walls, according to the brand.

What’s the difference between Hoka walking shoes and running shoes?

On its website, Hoka labels what activity each shoe is best for, like an everyday run, a walk, a trail run or “lifestyle,” meaning casual wear. Some shoes are labeled best for walking and running — so can you walk in running shoes, and vice versa? “I would never tell someone to run in walking shoes, but you can walk in most running shoes, which means there’s more options available,” says Sharkey. “It’s important to run in running shoes, but there’s some flexibility when it comes to walking,” says Sharkey.

With that said, what are the main differences between walking and running shoes? Here’s what experts told me:

Running shoes usually have a higher heel and a lower toe, which creates a pronounced rocker-shaped outsole and leads to a more energy-efficient stride, propelling you forward faster, says Sharkey. There’s also prominent cushioning in the heel and midfoot area. Most runners are heel strikers, meaning their heel hits the ground first, then their weight transitions to the forefoot, pushing them forward. Added cushioning helps with shock absorption, says Busenberg.

The toe box is also a bit bigger, which allows the toes to spread out more, and there’s often even cushioning throughout the shoe, says Sharkey.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/nov/13/acdc-concert-review-melbourne-show-australia-tour,AC/DC review – a thrilling show stuffed with classics … and your eardrums will never be the same,"On Wednesday afternoon, 374 bagpipers gathered in Melbourne’s Federation Square to play AC/DC’s It’s a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock’n’Roll), setting a new world record just up the road from where Bon Scott and the band famously played the song on the back of a flatbed truck riding up Swanston Street 50 years before.

It’s the one hit AC/DC no longer plays live, retired out of respect to Scott after his death in 1980. But you barely notice it is missing when their live shows are this stuffed with classics: an audible thrill ripples through the 80,000 punters in Melbourne Cricket Ground when AC/DC opens with If You Want Blood (You’ve Got It) then tears straight into Back in Black. Who else could play such a huge hit so early in a show? But Accadacca can, in what is essentially a greatest hits celebration that goes for more than two hours.

Let’s address the elephants in the room: yes, Brian Johnson is 78 and, no, his voice can’t reach the heights or hold out as long as it did in the 1980s. He can’t screech as he once could on songs like High Voltage or Highway to Hell, but he sure gives it a go with a smile on his face. Johnson was forced to leave AC/DC’s 2016 world tour because of severe hearing loss (Axl Rose stepped in) but a fix was found and you can tell he’s happy to be back, cackling like a gremlin between songs. (Accadacca doesn’t do stage banter, and no one minds.)

Likewise, Angus Young – still wearing his schoolboy shorts at 70 – is noticeably slower on certain early tracks, including the frenetic opening to Thunderstruck. But it is still Thunderstruck, and who cares when a whole stadium is singing that loudly, that joyfully, as one?

With his shock of white hair and skinny legs poking out of his shorts, Young simultaneously looks like an ancient wizard and confusingly childlike; when he trots back to the band at the end of a song, he looks like a lost little boy running for his parents – until he launches into a frenzied solo, his fingers moving almost too fast to see. He can still duckwalk the length of a huge stage, wild-eyed and juddering around as though he’s been electrocuted.

He slowly loses clothes during the set, even using his tie like a violin bow to play his guitar. By the end, when his shirt is almost completely unbuttoned, he’s in charge of the whole show.

On Let There Be Rock, Young launches into a lengthy, indulgent and hugely entertaining guitar solo that almost feels like a challenge to any who thought AC/DC weren’t still up to it. The rest of the band fades away as Young struts, taking breaks only to revel in the cheers before throwing himself on the floor and rolling around like a man possessed. “Where did that come from?” Johnson asks afterwards; who could say?

Johnson and Young are our ringleaders but they have tight support in the rhythm guitar of Stevie Young, who officially came onboard in 2014 after his uncle Malcolm was diagnosed with dementia; as well as the bassist, Chris Chaney, and the drummer, Matt Laug, who plays with the determination of a man trying to trigger an earthquake. Your eardrums won’t be the same again.

Though the tour is named for the 17th album Power Up, released in 2020, they only play one song from it. Instead, we get the best of rest: Shoot to Thrill, High Voltage, Highway to Hell, You Shook Me All Night Long, Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap, TNT and Whole Lotta Rosie. There’s even room for a surprise with Jailbreak, a song they have not played live since 1991, which is welcomed with huge enthusiasm.

This is AC/DC’s first show in Australia in 10 years and Melbourne is their first stop – after all, it is the band’s “ancestral homeland”, as Johnson puts it, being “the home of Mr Scott”. It’s hard not to suspect this may be the band’s last world tour, and maybe even their last trip to the homeland – but what a thrilling spectacle it is if you can get a ticket.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/24/horror-stories-feminised-workplace-crisis-male-identity-women,Horror stories of a ‘feminised workplace’ mask the real crisis in male identity | Finn Mackay,"First it was mechanisation threatening our jobs, then AI and now this: the Great Feminisation is taking over the workplace. Well, that’s according to American journalist Helen Andrews, who popularised this thesis in a speech to the National Conservatism conference in Washington DC.

The idea is that too many women in the workplace, and in positions of power, has led to the dominance of stereotypical feminine values, to the detriment of everyone. Girly things like conflict resolution rather than manly plain speaking, fussy HR departments, or a lack of healthy aggressive competition, have all created an imbalance in the workplace and in the world, suppressing stereotypical masculine values. Andrews fears for her sons and their future in the feminised world that she believes threatens us all.

The thesis makes two fundamental errors. First, stereotypes attached to femininity don’t represent all women, any more than stereotypes about masculinity define all men. Second, nobody needs a feminised world, whatever that nonsense even means, but we all need a feminist world. There’s a big difference.

For centuries, it was policy to keep women out of education and most professions, although women have, of course, always worked – in agriculture, in factories, or in service to rich people. Much of this was not in the formal economy, it was cash in hand. Work like childcare, washing or sewing was done at home, rather than in the public sphere. Yet work has always been gendered as masculine, because formal, paid employment outside the home has been seen as the preserve of men. So work comes to define masculinity, and therefore men, being viewed as core to men’s identity.

It is not only conservatives making these kinds of arguments. Scott Galloway, an American academic and author of a much-discussed new book, Notes on Being a Man, has summarised masculinity thus: “getting up at fucking six in the morning and going to work and doing shitty work such that you can protect your family economically”. In his book, he links falling wages and unemployment rates with a crisis in masculinity, and in men’s sense of identity. While he doesn’t argue for women’s removal from the workplace, he does frame these issues – that affect everyone, across the labour market – as male concerns.

The real problem facing men is that, like femininity, masculinity is still defined by backward stereotypes about what men should be. These stereotypes – including visible signifiers of financial success, respect and seniority in the workplace and public sphere – have always been put out of reach for many men, and perhaps now for most. A new report, The State of UK Men, from Beyond Equality, revealed that 88% of the men surveyed believed that being a man means providing financially for your family – and just over half felt it was more important that men, rather than women, were the breadwinners. However, 40% reported that their income was not enough to meet their daily needs, and more than half constantly worried about their financial future.

Women face these same economic challenges. The same survey found that equal numbers of men and women lack any sense of purpose or meaning in their life. The gender pay gap in the UK is around 13% across all employees and women are still more likely than men to be in part-time work, traditionally lower paid. Women are also more likely to be heads of households and raising children; they are what charities such as the Women’s Budget Group call the main “shock absorbers” of poverty.

The violence of poverty affects everyone, yet society responds with peculiar sympathy and grief when men face barriers to success in the arenas we have picked out to define their worth. This is what I call the masculinity burden. Attacks on men’s income, employment or job security are viewed not only as challenging in a human way, as they would be for anyone, but doubly challenging because they are portrayed as attacks on, and affronts to, masculinity itself. From this perspective, it is not that 50% of the experiences of precarity – women’s – are not seen; it’s that they are just not seen as being as bad for women, because women don’t carry this extra burden of masculinity.

The gendered effects of life experiences, such as redundancy or low pay, are clearly real. The State of UK Men finds that work and stable finances are still very much classed as the measure of men’s worth, leading to failure feeling like an existential threat. This is the pain and shame of not meeting gendered expectations. Women are no strangers to this either, in the ceaseless pressure of beauty standards attached to femininity, the presumption of motherhood and judgments about mothering, or in status being attached to male partners. The expectations can be different, but it’s the gendered rules that are the problem, rigging the game for us all, setting us up for failure in one area or another.

What men need to succeed in the workplace has nothing to do with the numbers of women employed – it has to do with job security, livable wages, affordable rents, reliable sick pay and flexible work around parenting and caring. This is what men say they want, too: one of the many positives from the report is that 83% of men believe in sharing housework and care with their partner, and 80% want practical support to help fathers be more present in family life. These policies would help everyone – not just at work, but out in the world, because all of us have human needs to give and receive love and care in our families and communities.

While President Donald Trump pushes for a quick resolution, the churning mud of the battlefield has produced only slow and painstaking gains for the Kremlin during the four years since its full-scale invasion.

From the front-line city of Pokrovsk in eastern Donetsk to Zaporizhzhia in the south and the northern region of Kharkiv, there is little doubt that Russia is making advances.

President Vladimir Putin has urged Ukraine to surrender key territory at the negotiating table — as Washington has suggested — or face Moscow's military taking it by force anyway. Trump has echoed this sentiment, warning that Ukraine ""will lose in a short period of time"" if it does not agree to the deal he has backed.

But battlefield monitors suggest the picture is not quite so bleak for Ukraine as Trump and Putin suggest.

Russia's gains are slow and incremental, won at a heavy cost against Kyiv’s overstretched army, according to these mostly Western observers, who see Moscow as overstating its position for diplomatic gain in negotiations with Washington.

Pokrovsk, a transit hub that has been the center of the fighting for months, could soon hand the Kremlin its first major capture in two years.

Yet, Russia would not be able to take the rest of Donetsk ""without significant casualties, probably in the hundreds of thousands,"" Chris Parry, a former NATO commander and rear admiral in the British Royal Navy, told NBC News in an interview. If Ukraine gives that up in a deal, it ""will leave the rest of the country vulnerable to a strike anytime that Putin wants to come back,"" he said.

Indeed, since Aug. 15, Russia has has been advancing at ""foot pace,” gaining just 3½ square miles a day, according to an analysis Sunday by the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington think tank.

In all, Russia has occupied only an additional 1% of territory since November 2022, war-watchers agree. Most of the 20% of Ukraine that Russia controls is made up of land seized by Russian-backed fighters after 2014, and the illegally annexed Crimean Peninsula.

Assuming it can keep up even this crawl, Russia would not capture the rest of Donetsk until at least August 2027 “and likely even longer,” the Institute for the Study of War said. And Putin is pressuring Ukraine to hand over this territory, not because it truly is a fait accompli, but merely “to save Russia significant amounts of time, effort, manpower, and resources,"" it said.

On the flip side, not even Ukraine's most ardent supporters could claim that its position is easy. Could it survive the Russian advance if it wasn’t coming under U.S. pressure to capitulate?

“That’s the million-dollar question,” said Michael A. Horowitz, a Jerusalem-based geopolitical consultant. “We’re in a battle of attrition, and both sides are paying a very high cost to defend or capture smaller and smaller areas.”

Pokrovsk is “on the verge of falling into Russian hands,” said Horowitz, who follows the conflict in minutiae.

That would allow Russian troops to turn their attention north to the “fortress belt” of Druzhkivka, Kramatorsk, Slovyansk and Kostyantynivka, a defensive line of cities that Kyiv has spent years reinforcing.

Giving Donetsk to Russia would hand over these cities anyway.

Ultimately, few Ukrainians believe this would be the end of the Kremlin’s aggression. Rather, it would give Russia a potent foothold in the heart of the country, from which it might be able to add to its history of broken ceasefires and diplomatic promises.

Ukrainian troops have for more than a year defended Pokrovsk. Now, most are pinned down in their positions, unable to move because of loitering Russian drones, and only resupplied by robotic tracked vehicles controlled remotely.

Further northeast up the Donetsk front line, Russia claimed its forces had captured a string of villages, including Yampil.

Meanwhile, in Zaporizhzhia, Russia has likely captured 15 villages since September, the Black Bird Group, a Finnish open-source intelligence agency, told The Kyiv Independent on Sunday.

Last week, both sides traded familiar claims and denials of Russian victory in Kupiansk, in the eastern Kharkiv region, which Russian commander Sergei Kuzovlev told Putin was a “key cog in Ukraine’s defenses.”

As of last Thursday, the general staff of the Ukrainian military said it was still under its control, deriding Russian ""propaganda"" that was “solely aimed at concealing the critical losses of the Russian army.""

NBC News could not independently verify the battlefield accounts from either side.

Putin has used these claims of victory to threaten Ukraine and Europe.

He warned in a speech Friday that if Ukraine rejects Trump’s peace efforts, “then both they and the European warmongers should understand that” the Kremlin’s recent victories will “inevitably be repeated in other key parts of the front.”

Jimmy Cliff, the Jamaican musician and actor who helped propel reggae into the international spotlight, has died at 81 years old. The singer-songwriter was known for hits such as ""Many Rivers to Cross,"" ""You Can Get It if You Really Want"" and the title track in the 1972 crime film The Harder They Come, in which he also starred as the main character.

According to his wife, Latifa Chambers, Cliff died due to a seizure followed by pneumonia. In an announcement on social media, Chambers wrote, ""To all his fans around the world, please know that your support was his strength throughout his whole career.""

Born James Chambers in 1944, Cliff grew up in a rural village in Jamaica, and began singing in school and in church. His father worked as a tailor, and hoped his son would study medicine. After being exposed to American music from New Orleans and Florida through the radio, a teenaged James moved to Kingston to pursue an artistic career.

His first major hit in Jamaica, ""Hurricane Hattie,"" referenced a 1961 storm that wreaked havoc in the Caribbean. In 1964, Cliff was selected to perform at the World's Fair in New York City as a representative for the island. The following year, British-born producer Chris Blackwell signed Cliff to his label, Island Records, and persuaded him to move to England.

Though he initially struggled to find his footing with audiences abroad, Cliff earned critical and commercial success for songs such as ""Wonderful World, Beautiful People"" and the protest anthem ""Vietnam."" Despite addressing war and tragedy in his music, the artist infused his lyrics with a hopeful outlook.

""I grew up economically poor, spiritually rich,"" Cliff told NPR in 2010. ""So even though I had this condition, that kind of balance made me always take the downside and kind of put an up to it.""

Cliff's career reached new heights when he was cast in the lead role of Ivanhoe ""Ivan"" Martin in the seminal Jamaican film The Harder They Come, directed by Perry Henzell. In it, Ivan is an aspiring reggae musician who moves to Kingston from the countryside, faces poverty and exploitation in the city and descends into a life of crime, eventually becoming a violent fugitive with a chart-topping single. The film features several of Cliff's songs, which helped turn The Harder They Come into a national sensation in Jamaica and an international cult classic.

""That movie really had a tremendous effect on bringing the Jamaican world, music and culture and everything, to the forefront,"" Chris Blackwell, who also served as executive producer for the film, told Fresh Air's Terry Gross in 2022.

Cliff continued to perform and record for decades, collaborating with artists including Elvis Costello, Annie Lennox and Wyclef Jean. In 1985, he was one of the dozens of artists featured on the all-star anti-apartheid song ""Sun City."" The following year, Cliff won a Grammy Award for best reggae recording for his album Cliff Hanger.

In 2010, he became the second reggae artist, after Bob Marley, to be inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. Two years later, Cliff reintroduced himself — and reggae — to the world with his album Rebirth, which would go on to win a Grammy for best reggae album in 2013.

In an interview with NPR, Cliff described that album as a revitalization of his artistic vision, which necessitated going back to the sound that first launched his career from the studios of Kingston — playing with the same instruments and following the same live-to-tape recording techniques that he'd employed in the genre's beginnings. The album included a cover of ""The Guns of Brixton"" by The Clash, which references Ivanhoe Martin in its lyrics.

""One of the reasons for covering that song was to show and remind people the influence that reggae music had on punk music,"" Cliff told NPR.

Al Jazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/24/trump-orders-blacklisting-muslim-brotherhood-branches-as-terrorist-groups,Trump orders blacklisting Muslim Brotherhood branches as ‘terrorist’ groups,"White House cites groups’ alleged support for Hamas, accusing them of waging campaign against US interests and allies.

Washington, DC – United States President Donald Trump has ordered his aides to start a process to label the branches of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, Lebanon and Jordan as “terrorist” organisations, citing their alleged support for the Palestinian group Hamas.

Trump issued the decree on Monday as Washington intensified its crackdown on Israel’s foes in the region.

The decree accused Muslim Brotherhood leaders in Jordan of providing “material support” to Hamas and the Lebanese branch of the group – known as al-Jamaa al-Islamiya – of siding with Hamas and Hezbollah in their war with Israel.

It also claimed that an Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood leader “called for violent attacks against United States partners and interests” during Israel’s war on Gaza. But it was not clear what the White House was referring to. The Muslim Brotherhood has been banned in Egypt and mostly driven underground.

“President Trump is confronting the Muslim Brotherhood’s transnational network, which fuels terrorism and destabilization campaigns against US interests and allies in the Middle East,” the White House said.

Trump’s order directs the secretary of state and the treasury secretary to consult with the US intelligence chief and produce a report on the designation within 30 days.

A formal “foreign terrorist organisation” label would then officially apply to the Muslim Brotherhood branches within 45 days after the report.

The process is usually a formality, and the designation may come sooner. The decree also opens the door to blacklisting other Muslim Brotherhood branches.

The White House is also pushing to label the groups as “designated global terrorists”.

The designations would make it illegal to provide material support to the group. It would also mostly ban their current and former members from entering the US, and enable economic sanctions to choke their revenue streams.

Longstanding demand of right-wing activists

Established in 1928 by Egyptian Muslim scholar Hassan al-Banna, the Muslim Brotherhood has offshoots and branches across the Middle East in the shape of political parties and social organisations.

Across the Middle East, Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated parties take part in elections and say they are committed to peaceful political participation.

But the group has been outlawed by several countries across the region.

Blacklisting the Muslim Brotherhood has been a longstanding demand for right-wing activists in the US.

But critics say that the move could further enable authoritarianism and the crackdown on free political expression in the Middle East.

The decree could also be used to target Muslim American activists on allegations of ties to the Muslim Brotherhood or contributions to charities affiliated with the group.

Right-wing groups have long pushed to outlaw Muslim American groups with unfounded accusations of ties to the Muslim Brotherhood.

Nihad Awad, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), said the designation should not have an impact on Muslim American advocacy groups and charities.

“The American Muslim organisations are solid,” Awad told Al Jazeera. “They are based in the US. The relief organisations serve millions of people abroad. I hope that this will not impact their work.”

But he noted that anti-Muslim activists have been trying to promote “the conspiracy theory that every Muslim organisation in the US is a front to the Muslim Brotherhood”.

Recently, Republican Texas Governor Greg Abbott designated both the Muslim Brotherhood and CAIR as “foreign terrorist organisations and transnational criminal organisations”.

CAIR has sued the governor’s office in response.

Analysts say Trump’s order was aimed at pandering to domestic audiences, and the threat of a terrorism designation means very little to the Middle East.

“It’s very amateurish foreign policy, but it appeals to the right-wing zealots in the US and Israel,” said Rami Khouri, a distinguished fellow at the American University of Beirut.

He noted that the order comes as the US tries “desperately to make progress” on the ceasefire in Gaza, which “the Israelis largely ignore, and Hamas largely adheres to”.

The White House wants to “keep showing that the Trump administration is doing everything it can to fight terrorism and bring peace and a happy, good life for all. This is, of course, fantasy,” Khouri said from the US city of Boston.

“I don’t think many people take it seriously. It’s not aimed at the Middle East. It’s aimed at domestic television audiences in the US and donors who provide the Republican Party with support, and the Republican Party is haemorrhaging support now because of its various and ineffective policies,” he added.",2025-11-24 00:00:00,literal,Factual reporting on policy and elections,literal,literal,0,literal,0.8131985,0.18680145,0.8131985,True

There were no casualties from the eruption, which sent thick plumes of smoke up to 14km (nine miles) into the sky, sending ash clouds to Yemen, Oman, India, and northern Pakistan, according to the Toulouse Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre (VAAC) in France.

Ahmed Abdela, a resident of the Afar region, said it “felt like a sudden bomb had been thrown”. Many people who had been heading to the Danakil desert, a local tourist attraction, were left stranded in ash-covered Afdera on Monday, he said.

Mohammed Seid, a local administrator, said there were no casualties, but the eruption could have economic implications for the local community of livestock herders.

“While no human lives and livestock have been lost so far, many villages have been covered in ash, and as a result, their animals have little to eat,” he said.

The volcano, which rises about 500 metres in altitude, sits within the Rift Valley, a zone of intense geological activity where two tectonic plates meet.

The Smithsonian Institution’s Global Volcanism Program said Hayli Gubbi has had no known eruptions during the current geological epoch, which experts know as the Holocene.

The Holocene began approximately 12,000 years ago at the end of the last Ice Age.

Al Jazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/24/attack-in-pakistans-peshawar-what-we-know-about-victims-attackers,"Attack in Pakistan’s Peshawar: What we know about victims, attackers","Three security personnel are killed in an attack on paramilitary headquarters in northwestern city of Peshawar.

At least three security personnel have been killed when a suicide bomber and gunmen attacked the Federal Constabulary (FC) headquarters in Pakistan’s northwestern city of Peshawar.

“Three FC personnel deployed at the gate were martyred and four others were wounded,” said Peshawar Capital City Police Officer Mian Saeed Ahmad, adding that one assailant died after detonating explosives and two other attackers were shot dead by security forces.

Monday’s attack, which wounded 11 people, came less than two weeks after a suicide attack outside a court in the capital, Islamabad, killed 12 people.

Here is what we know so far and why attacks have surged in Pakistan in recent months.

What happened in Peshawar?

Just after 8am (03:00 GMT) on Monday, a suicide bomber detonated his explosives at the gate of the security headquarters, after which other attackers entered the complex, located in the heart of the city, according to local media.

About 150 security personnel had gathered inside the headquarters for morning parade drills when the attack took place, Ahmad said.

“The terrorists involved in today’s attack were on foot and failed to reach the parade area, and a timely response by our forces prevented a much larger tragedy,” he told The Associated Press news agency.

He said authorities had collected samples of the body parts of the attackers for DNA tests. He added that police are still investigating to determine the identity and nationality of the attackers.

Zulfiqar Hameed, the police chief of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, told the AFP news agency that “the attack has concluded, and a clearance operation is under way to determine whether any unexploded ordnance is present.”

Where in Peshawar did the attack take place?

The attack took place at the FC headquarters, located in a densely populated area on Sunehri Masjid Road in Peshawar Cantonment, a garrison area under the administrative control of the Pakistan army.

The FC is a paramilitary police force based in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. It was established in 1913 through the merger of two smaller paramilitary forces, the Border Military Police and Samana Rifles. It was originally called the Fron­tier Constabulary until it was renamed by the government in July.

What do we know about the victims?

Three paramilitary personnel were killed in the attack, Javed Iqbal, the deputy commandant of the force, said.

Additionally, 11 people were wounded. Asim Khan, a spokesperson at the government-run Lady Reading Hospital, said all 11 were listed in stable condition.

Who has claimed responsibility for the attack?

Jamatul Ahrar, a faction of the Pakistan Taliban, also known as Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, has claimed responsibility for the attack, the local newspaper Dawn reported.

The Pakistan Taliban have also been blamed for similar assaults in the country, which has witnessed a surge in such attacks in recent months.

The unrest has put pressure on relations between Islamabad and Afghanistan’s Taliban-led government. Pakistan alleges the Pakistan Taliban have been able to operate unhindered inside Afghanistan since the Taliban’s 2021 takeover there.

What happened to the attackers?

There is still no clarity on the number of attackers. AP reported there were two suicide bombers without mentioning the total number of people involved in the attack while AFP said there was a bomber among the assailants. Reuters reported there were three suicide bombers.

“Initially, three militants tried to attack the headquarters. One terrorist blew himself up at the gate while two others tried to enter the premises but were gunned down by FC personnel,” Ahmad told reporters, according to Dawn.

Have attacks increased in Pakistan?

Pakistan has seen an uptick in attacks in recent years.

The country has recorded 1,517 “terrorism-related” incidents this year as of Wednesday, according to the South Asia Terrorism Portal, maintained by the London-based charity Action on Armed Violence.

According to the portal, there were 1,303 “terrorism-related” incidents in 2024, 921 in 2023 and 630 in 2022.

Figures from the Islamabad-based Center for Research and Security Studies showed that 2024 was Pakistan’s deadliest year in almost a decade with 2,526 deaths in attacks. The victims included nearly 700 security personnel, more than 900 civilians and about 900 rebels.

How have authorities reacted?

President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the attack in an X post.

President Asif Ali Zardari strongly condemns the attack on the Federal Constabulary HQ in Peshawar, offering heartfelt condolences & praising the courage of security forces. He affirms that externally backed Fitna-al-Khawarij cannot weaken Pakistan’s unity, resilience or resolve. — The President of Pakistan (@PresOfPakistan) November 24, 2025

Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also condemned the attack in a statement, saying the sacrifices of the personnel killed in the attack will be remembered, Dawn reported.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/24/shabana-mahmood-open-britain-immigration-asylum-policies,Shabana Mahmood is an avatar of open Britain – that’s what makes her fable about immigration so seductive | Nesrine Malik,"Over the past couple of weeks, Shabana Mahmood has launched not only her new asylum crackdown policy, but also her “story”. The two are inseparable: her story justifies the crackdown. It moralises the crackdown. And it silences criticism of the crackdown. Sold as an origin story from within an immigrant and racialised experience, the purpose is to imbue her politics with sacred authenticity – the credibility of the first person. It is clever and effective. It is cynical and disgraceful.

“I am the child of immigrants” is how Mahmood now starts her fable. Immigrants who came here legally. She goes on to tell us that immigration is tearing this country apart, and proposes policies that mean UK-born children, who have known no life anywhere else, will be deported. As she launches policies that will leave refugees homeless and without support, tear families apart, punish those legally in the country for claiming any benefits and make settlement and security a long and arduous process, Mahmood declares: “this is a moral mission for me”.

A test of logic for sure, but the story can help. You see, after being accused of “stoking division” with “immoderate language”, Mahmood says “unfortunately, I am the one who is regularly called a ‘fucking Paki’ and told to ‘go back home’.” She knows – better than virtue-signalling white people – what the trenches actually look like. And so she must protect immigrants by hurting them. In her telling, racism and xenophobia seem not themselves objectively bad things that must be combatted, but a natural outcome that occurs when too many rights are given to immigrants and asylum seekers. If only they had fewer rights, then people wouldn’t hate them so much and we would hit some golden ratio where everyone will be happier. Because immigration perception and immigration reality are famously aligned things.

Credulous observers will quiver in the face of her personal conviction. Whatever you think of her politics, you’ve got to see that she means it. Because how can she not? She is brown and the daughter of immigrants! Let me break it to you gently: it is entirely possible for people of colour and the descendants of immigrants to be disingenuous and use their identities as excuses for their terrible politics. The former Conservative home secretary Suella Braverman dedicated her maiden speech in parliament to her father and mother, both immigrants. And yet, she later said “I would love to be having a front page of the Telegraph with a plane taking off to Rwanda. That’s my dream, it’s an obsession”.

Mahmood is not a novelty, just an addition to the ranks of Suella Braverman, Kemi Badenoch, Priti Patel and even Rishi Sunak, who in various forms used their identities to dictate what the correct immigration and race politics should be, because they’ve been there. Mahmood is just the first Labour politician to do so. Her contribution reveals two things. One is mundane, the other is structural. First, there is nothing unusual or new about immigrants creating different, lower classes of immigrants and then separating themselves from them: legal v illegal; working and housed v needing benefits; assimilated v ghettoised. But here is the structural part: being a politician of immigrant background is a powerful thing in a country utterly banjaxed by immigration discourse.

This is a sort of late-stage identity politics. A way in which the victim narrative so condemned by critics of “wokeness” remains holy and unquestionable when it is used for a purpose that isn’t equality. It’s using identity as a way to elevate and uphold stories that can be wielded in the service of authority, not to challenge it.

It takes a prodigious amount of stupidity or ignorance not to see that the home secretary provides that important service, at a time when the nation is riven by racism and xenophobia. Reform UK is ascendant, and the Labour government is trying to outflank the right while trying not to look enormously racist and xenophobic while doing so. Enter Mahmood to reassure you that it is, in fact, a sort of kindness to force children on to planes and eye up items that are not of “sentimental value” so that asylum seekers can contribute to their costs. Enter Mahmood to collapse all sorts of categories together, in one instance saying division is caused by asylum seekers, in another saying it is caused by the high recent rate of net immigration, expanding the numbers of people that need to be slapped with harsher conditions so they don’t force the public to become racist.

And it also requires a very short memory to believe that Mahmood is acting out of evangelist conviction, rather than convenience when, not too long ago, she supported a general amnesty for undocumented workers who have been living in the UK for 10 years, and in 2020 called on the Tory government to halt a deportation flight. She now vows to fight “vexatious last-minute claims” that “frustrate” removals.

But to show you the allure of being an anti-immigration immigrant, this will not be seen as a cynical reversal but, as the Spectator puts it, as a conversion – a final seeing of the light. And who cares about the embarrassing optics of it all, when the reward is Mahmood’s admission into the ranks of the contenders, the players? Much has been written, since her two-story debut, of the “new hard woman of British politics”, the proponent of “Mahmoodism”, a devout outsider driven by conviction politics, the next prime minister. Michael Gove is barely able to contain his excitement at the minister he considers “far and away the most impressive person in the Labour government”.

There is a sort of gamified glee to it all. The contrast between the pain Mahmood is about to inflict on some of the most vulnerable and desperate – exemplified by the flippant “sorry, we’re closing!” imagery that accompanied her announcement that asylum hotels will be shuttered – and the excitement she has triggered in the political discourse, tells its own story. Mahmood is here to provide the answer, to absolve. To free the country from its anxieties about immigration and race. To turn away from the hard work of confronting the economic failure, cultural capitulation and cowardice that has enabled the rise of the far right.

Mahmood’s story is seductive, because it allows us to believe that the problem is not a bigger one about a country where dark nativism lurks unchecked, and where scarcity and inequality are endemic, but rather about resentment and racism being naturally triggered by too many foreign bodies that need feeding, watering and housing. If the child of actual immigrants says so, if the target of actual racism believes so, then, thank god, how can we doubt it?",2025-11-24 00:00:00,literal,Factual reporting on data and policy,literal,literal,0,figurative,0.060509115,0.9394909,0.9394909,False
The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/24/english-public-school-nigel-farage-reform-leader,I endured an English public school. But that’s not the only reason I’m unsurprised about the Farage allegations | Musa Okwonga,"When I see the allegations of racism against Nigel Farage from his schooldays, I can’t say I am greatly surprised. There are those who believe that the Reform UK leader’s persona must have been developed to win over working-class voters, or the “red wall”. I know that it is quite in keeping with the sentiments expressed by plenty of young men in elite institutions like English public schools – the kind of men who run the world.

Farage was educated at Dulwich college from 1975 to 1982; there, fellow students have told the Guardian, he allegedly used racist insults about fellow pupils and sang a song with the lyrics “Gas ’em all”. I attended Eton a couple of decades later, but the attitudes of some of the people I encountered there were not very different. One pupil, having fallen out with me over some perceived slight, boasted that his great-grandfather was a slave driver. A Jewish friend who was there with me at the same time told me how common it was to hear “Jew” or “rabbi” being used to describe anyone who was thought to be mean with their money. When I later saw Old Etonian Boris Johnson referring to black people as “piccaninnies” with “watermelon smiles”, I thought back to the peers of mine who would erupt into rants filled with racist stereotypes whenever they saw the West Indies cricket team on the TV.

But there is another reason I am not surprised when I read about Farage’s alleged teenage behaviour. As grim as these stories are, just look at the damage that Farage has gone on to do as an adult, and the company he has gone on to keep. If you were looking in the school yearbook, wondering “where are they now?”, then under his entry you would want to add: “He inspired the country on a tide of xenophobia to leave the EU, a decision that most of the country either regrets or outright hates, and afterwards went abroad to get a standing ovation from the German far right”. What has truly changed since Farage’s schooldays is the society around him. We will get back to that in a moment.

For now, though, I am thinking about school. I don’t know what Farage was like when he was a teenager, but – in my own regrettable experience, and as I am reliably informed – the majority of people who expressed racist worldviews at school and university have not moved away from those opinions with age. If anything, they have become significantly more extreme in their outlook, viewing the era of Trump and Musk with relish.

And why wouldn’t they? Not only have several of my former classmates retreated behind their walls and gates, they are now fuelled by the various algorithms that send a never-ending stream of loathing to their smartphones. Just as a mosquito requires stagnant pools of water in which to thrive, so their stagnant social circles provide the perfect breeding ground for increasingly toxic strands of bigotry. I was recently at a university reunion and it was striking to see one man, who has somehow gone on to scale even greater heights of racial prejudice than in his student days, surrounded as if he were a returning hero. Most disappointing was to see an old and close friend voice deep and growing enthusiasm for the politics of Johnson.

Almost as disappointing was to hear of Farage’s visit to my old school and to hear that, in the words of one onlooker, Eton boys had cheered Farage’s “worst comments on migrants and Covid”, and had subjected visiting girls to “racial slurs” and “misogynistic comments”. When I saw this quote, my sympathies went immediately to the students of migrant heritage in that environment, especially the visibly foreign ones. The college said it had apologised “unreservedly” for the “totally unacceptable” behaviour, but it is difficult to understand what other outcome they expected. This is what Farage does; this is his skill. When it comes to stoking hatred, Farage is what is referred to in the football world – a world that, for shameless political gain, he is now pretending to understand – as a generational talent. He is a Pied Piper, leading his followers to a future that – for now, at least – they find absolutely exhilarating.

Where, though, is his vision of immigration leading the UK? To answer that we can look to the actions of senior members of the current government, who have already bent their policies to his will. The mood they have created is so sour that, as reported by the Guardian, “record numbers of overseas-trained doctors are quitting the UK, leaving the NHS at risk of huge gaps in its workforce, with hostility towards migrants blamed for the exodus.” For the longest time, the approach by European politicians such as Farage has been “if you don’t like it, then leave”. It should be no surprise that, increasingly, the response is “with pleasure”.

We return, now, to how the society around Farage has changed. We have long had a media culture that prefers its political shows to be populated by entertainers rather than experts, and that trend has accelerated in recent years. We are also now in an era when, every single day, the richest person in modern history – who, according to The New Yorker, is responsible through aid cuts for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of human beings – wakes up and amplifies the most extreme far-right content from the biggest communication platform the world has known, a platform he solely owns. In the UK, the soaring economic inequalities – supercharged by Brexit – have led to such scarcity that many voters are turning against those arriving in the country, blaming them for trying to steal more of a shrinking pie.

Of course, it is in Farage’s interests to stop people from focusing on who is actually using the bulk of resources, because the greediest consumers are some of his funders and friends. Farage’s ultimate message is simple: open borders for the super-rich, closed borders for everyone else. It’s not quite as catchy a slogan as “take back control”, but, as the reality of his true position becomes clearer, it may just take flight. If that does happen, then we will be able to say that the adults in the UK are finally taking Farage as seriously as several of his classmates always have.",2025-11-24 00:00:00,metaphor,Soaring used as metaphor for rapid increase,metaphor,figurative,1,figurative,0.06653979,0.9334602,0.9334602,True
Al Jazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/31/one-month-into-a-us-government-shutdown-how-its-going-so-far,One month into a US government shutdown – how it’s going so far,"The US government has been shut down for 30 days. Al Jazeera visualises where things stand right now.

The US government shutdown, which began on October 1 when Democrats and Republicans failed to agree on a funding bill, has now passed one month. Americans are increasingly facing delays and interruptions to their everyday lives.

Around 730,000 federal employees (32 percent of the federal workforce) have been working without pay, according to data from the Bipartisan Policy Center, while 670,000 have been furloughed – sent home without pay – because government departments can’t legally pay them. That number will go up as the shutdown drags on and government departments run out of money.

The shutdown has led to the disruption to or even full cessation of a number of services, including essential food assistance.

How long has the shutdown been going on?

In the lead-up to the shutdown in October, US President Donald Trump threatened to pursue mass federal layoffs after Democrats refused to approve a Republican-backed spending bill without key amendments that would restore funding for public health programmes.

Neither side backed down, resulting in the shutdown, which is now the second-longest in US history.

It has been rare for government shutdowns in the past to last for longer than a few days, but they do happen sometimes.

The last shutdown was during Trump’s first term as US president. Albeit only a partial shutdown, it was the longest in US history, lasting 35 days from December 22, 2018, to January 25, 2019. It was sparked by a row over the building of a wall along the border with Mexico and ended only when Trump announced a tentative deal with congressional leaders to reopen the government for three weeks while negotiations continued.

Since 1976, when the current process for setting and approving government budgets was established, the government has experienced 20 funding gaps, resulting in 10 shutdowns.

What happens during a shutdown, and which services are affected?

During a government shutdown, non-essential federal services such as national parks and museums, or regulatory agencies, are halted or reduced, and many government employees are furloughed – placed on unpaid leave.

Essential personnel – such as military service members, law enforcement officers, air traffic controllers, and agents for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) – are required to keep working, often without pay, until funding is restored.

How many people work for the federal government?

More than two million people are employed by the federal government across the US.

Just over seven percent (162,489) of all federal workers are based in Washington, DC, followed by 6.7 percent (150,679) in California, 6.5 percent (147,358) in Virginia, 6.4 percent (144,497) in Maryland and 5.8 percent (130,686) in Texas.

The locations of 276,235 employees are not publicly available.

How many are furloughed or working without pay?

According to the latest estimates from the Bipartisan Policy Center, some 730,000 federal employees are working without pay, while about 670,000 have been furloughed.

At the Department of Veterans Affairs, 97 percent of 462,000 personnel are still performing their duties. Most are being paid as most of the department’s funding does not come from annual appropriations – Congress-approved budgets.

About 95 percent of the Department of Homeland Security’s 271,000 employees are still working – most without pay – including Secret Service agents, immigration and border control officers, airport security, Coast Guard workers and emergency workers in disaster relief.

Some 90 percent of the Department of Justice’s 115,000 employees are still working – mostly without pay – including law enforcement, FBI agents, criminal prosecutors and prison guards.

Conversely, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has 91 percent of its 4,300 employees furloughed. Only those involved in monitoring markets and handling urgent fraud issues continue to work.

About 89 percent of the Environmental Protection Agency’s 15,000 workers have been furloughed. Security guards, criminal investigators and emergency response workers continue to work.

About 87 percent of the Department of Education’s 2,450 government staff have been furloughed. Those still working include workers distributing student aid and grants to schools.

What is the impact on federal programmes?

Come November 1, some essential government programmes will lose funding altogether.

The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) said on October 10 that it would have “insufficient funds” to pay food benefits by the end of this month.

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) – overseen by the USDA – will run out of funds by the end of this week. More than 42 million Americans rely on food assistance.

SNAP does have access to a $5bn contingency fund, which might sustain benefits for a few weeks – SNAP costs the federal government $99.8bn each year, or roughly $8.3bn per month. But, according to Reuters, the USDA will not use these for assistance that is set to lapse in November.

The Trump administration has said it will not use emergency funds to prop up the programme.

Also facing a lack of funding is the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), which provides food, breastfeeding support and education to more than six million pregnant women, young mothers and children.

What will the economic impact be?

The impact of a shutdown on the economy is usually temporary and not far-reaching. Furloughed and unpaid workers’ pay is generally backdated once a shutdown ends and funding is released.

However, that doesn’t mean it has no impact. Contracted workers tend to be worse affected than others, as these workers will only receive back pay if their contracting employers are able to provide it.

The Trump administration has also threatened not to provide back pay or to fire workers altogether, meaning this time around, the shutdown could affect the economy more.

According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the partial shutdown in 2018-19 reduced gross domestic product (GDP) growth by about 0.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018 ($3bn) and by about 0.2 percent in the first quarter of 2019 ($8bn). This was mainly due to the loss of furloughed workers’ pay and delayed spending on goods and services.

About $3bn of these losses were not expected to be recovered, so GDP in 2019 was estimated to be 0.02 percent lower than it would otherwise have been.

This time around, analysts estimate that the shutdown will shave 0.1-0.2 percentage points off GDP for each week that it carries on, which equates to about $15bn a week.

In a JPMorgan briefing note, economist Michael Feroli wrote: “The impact could be worse this time due to the threatened layoffs and actual job loss, which could create risks for the labour market and consumer spending.”

Al Jazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/24/us-judge-dismisses-criminal-charges-against-james-comey-letitia-james,"US judge dismisses criminal charges against James Comey, Letitia James","The court found that lawyer Lindsey Halligan had been illegally appointed to her role as acting US attorney under President Donald Trump.

A United States federal judge has thrown out the criminal charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James and James Comey, the former head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).

On Monday, District Judge Cameron McGowan Currie determined that the prosecutor overseeing the two cases, Lindsey Halligan, had been illegally appointed, which in turn rendered the indictments void.

“All actions flowing from Ms Halligan’s defective appointment”, including the indictments against Comey and James, were unlawful exercises of executive power and are hereby set aside”, Currie said.

The decision is a major setback for the administration of President Donald Trump, who personally petitioned for criminal charges against James and Comey.

On his social media platform, Comey praised the decision from the court.

“I’m grateful that the court ended the case against me, which was a prosecution based on malevolence and incompetence and a reflection of what the Department of Justice has become under Donald Trump,” he said in a video uploaded on Instagram.

He continued to say that a message must be sent that the president “cannot use the Department of Justice to target his political enemies”.

In a statement to US media, James said she was “heartened by today’s victory”.

“I remain fearless in the face of these baseless charges as I continue fighting for New Yorkers every single day”.

But the legal worries for James and Comey, both prominent Trump critics, may not be over yet.

In dismissing the criminal charges, Currie rendered her verdict without prejudice, meaning that both cases could be refiled.

She did, however, rule that Halligan “had no legal authority” to bring the indictments, leaving questions about the future of her role as prosecutor.

In the aftermath of the ruling, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt denounced Currie as a “partisan judge” and emphasised that the administration would fight the decision.

“I know there was a judge who is clearly trying to shield Letitia James and James Comey from receiving accountability, and that’s why they took this unprecedented action to throw away the indictments against these two individuals,” Leavitt said.

“But the Department of Justice will be appealing very soon. And it is our position that Lindsey Halligan is extremely qualified for this position – but more importantly, was legally appointed to it.”

Al Jazeera’s Alan Fisher, reporting from Washington, DC, also said that an appeal by the Justice Department was “almost certain”.

“But for the moment, this is a victory for James Comey and also a victory for Letitia James, and a defeat for Donald Trump and his Department of Justice”.

A controversial choice as prosecutor

Halligan had been appointed in September to serve as interim US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia.

Trump had a public falling-out with Halligan’s predecessor, Erik Siebert, who reportedly refused to file charges against James due to a lack of evidence.

That triggered outrage in the White House. Siebert announced his resignation on September 19, and the following day, Trump took to social media to declare that he had fired the prosecutor himself.

“He even lied to the media and said he quit, and that we had no case,” Trump wrote. “No, I fired him, and there is a GREAT CASE, and many lawyers, and legal pundits, say so.”

The president also addressed Attorney General Pam Bondi in the message, saying that the Department of Justice needed to move forward with charges against James, Comey and a US senator, Adam Schiff of California.

“What about Comey, Adam ‘Shifty’ Schiff, Leticia??? They’re all guilty as hell, but nothing is going to be done,” Trump wrote.

He urged Bondi to act immediately to secure indictments, signalling that Halligan would help.

“We can’t delay any longer, it’s killing our reputation and credibility,” Trump said. “JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!”

Before her appointment, Halligan had no prosecutorial experience, and her background was largely in insurance law. Previously, she served as a personal lawyer to Trump.

Within days of taking up her role as US attorney, Halligan had secured an indictment against Comey for allegedly lying to Congress and obstructing a Senate proceeding.

Then, on October 6, Halligan unveiled a second indictment against James, accusing her of mortgage fraud.

A third indictment arrived on October 16, this time against Trump’s former national security adviser, John Bolton.

All three have denied wrongdoing and claimed the charges were acts of political retribution. Comey, James and Bolton have all criticised Trump publicly, and James even successfully pursued a civil fraud case against Trump in New York state.

Comey, James seek dismissal

Lawyers for the defendants have explored multiple channels to have the cases dismissed before trial.

On November 13, Judge Currie heard opening arguments in one petition brought by James and Comey.

They asserted that Halligan’s appointment as US attorney was invalid, since she did not have judicial approval.

Normally, interim US attorneys may only stay in the position for a span of 120 days. After that period, federal judges in the district may decide who fills the role.

Siebert had served for a 120-day period and had gotten judicial permission to continue as acting US attorney until the Senate could confirm a permanent occupant for the role.

But Halligan did not have the judges’ approval. That made her appointment as US attorney illegal, according to lawyers for Comey and James.

Lawyers for the Justice Department, however, argued that the issue amounted to a mere “paperwork error” – and that Attorney General Bondi had signed off on the indictments.

Still, the hearings in Currie’s courtroom raised serious questions about the validity of the indictments.

Currie raised concerns that the grand jury transcript in Comey’s case was incomplete, an issue later echoed by Magistrate Judge William Fitzpatrick in a separate ruling on November 17.

He said the records indicate “a disturbing pattern of profound investigative missteps”, including misleading statements from the prosecutor and the use of an unrelated search warrant. He also pointed out that it seemed the final indictment against Comey had never been fully presented to the grand jury, as required.

In another courtroom last week, overseen by Judge Michael Nachmanoff, the Justice Department acknowledged that it had indeed failed to give the grand jury a chance to review the final Comey indictment.",2025-11-24 00:00:00,literal,Factual reporting on reporting and policy,literal,literal,0,literal,0.64508325,0.35491675,0.64508325,True

He was 81.

""It’s with profound sadness that I share that my husband, Jimmy Cliff, has crossed over due to a seizure followed by pneumonia. I am thankful for his family, friends, fellow artists, and coworkers who have shared his journey with him,"" his wife, Latifa Chambers, wrote on Instagram.

He was best known for songs including ""Many Rivers to Cross"" and ""The Harder They Come,"" the title song for the movie of the same name from 1972, which featured Cliff. The film's soundtrack was a major international success and helped spread the appeal of Jamaican reggae.

Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness said in a statement: ""His music lifted people through hard times, inspired generations, and helped to shape the global respect that Jamaican culture enjoys today.""

Tributes poured in from the musical world, including many from artists whom Cliff inspired.

""A true foundation, a pillar of our music, and one of the first to carry reggae out into the world,"" Ali Campbell, of the British reggae group UB40, said on X.

Born in Jamaica in 1944, Cliff scored his first local hit at age 14 with ""Hurricane Hattie"" and would go on to win two Grammy awards and pick up seven nominations.

He was only one of two Jamaicans to be inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, alongside Bob Marley. He was inducted in 2010, with an introductory speech by Wyclef Jean. An essay commemorating Cliff by writer Rob Bowman said that if he had done nothing but star in ""The Harder They Come,"" he would have merited inclusion.

Cliff was a foundational figure in the Jamaican reggae scene. He worked as an A&R man, discovering new talent for Beverley's Records. The legendary label promoted ska, rocksteady and eventually reggae and played a role in the discoveries of both Desmond Dekker and a young Bob Marley.

A prolific artist well into later life, Cliff collaborated with a string of non-reggae musicians, including the Rolling Stones and Paul Simon. At the same time, the likes of Bruce Springsteen and Willie Nelson have recorded versions of his songs.

Bob Dylan declared Cliff's song ""Vietnam"" the ""greatest protest song ever written,"" according to Cliff's website.

After a creative resurgence in 2012 with the Grammy-winning album ""Rebirth,"" Cliff said, according to his website: ""Now, I feel I have not completed what I’m here on this planet to do.

Simon & Schuster

Earlier this month, I kept picking up and putting down Lily King's new novel, Heart the Lover. I love King's writing but the opening section was hard for me to take — not in a grisly Cormac McCarthy or scary Stephen King kind of way — but in an ""Ugh, I remember being that girl, that age"" kind of way.

Heart the Lover opens in a college class of the 1980s. The professor, a man, is teaching 17th-century British literature and he's selected a student's essay — a creative piece — to read aloud. But, first, he holds up the essay to remark on ""its vulgar packaging"" — the fact that it's typed on ""neon-orange"" paper.

Sponsor Message

The embarrassed student-author is a young woman nicknamed ""Jordan."" She tells us that Halloween construction paper was all she had available when she was typing the essay on deadline. Here's how Jordan, decades later, will remember what follows:

“There are two smart guys in the class. They sit up front together .... The professor runs things by them so often I assume they’re his grad school TAs. When my essay gets passed back to me, they both turn to watch where it goes.



After that day, the copper-haired one [Sam] begins migrating back. Three classes later, he takes a seat beside me.



Soon he is walking me across campus ....



We talk exclusively about the class.



‘He’s not focusing enough on Cromwell,’ [Sam] says, ....



I agree. What else can I do? I am a mere student, and he is a scholar. That much is clear right away. ... And Sam isn’t even a grad student. He’s a senior, like me.



Later I go to the library and read about who Cromwell was, ...

Ugh. Now, young Jordan is no pushover — she's ambitious, putting herself through college on loans and waitressing jobs and she harbors a barely formed desire to be a writer. But her path will take longer to carve out.

The well-read bright boys, meanwhile, house sit and are invited to dinners by their male professors. They're the heirs apparent to the kingdom of books and ideas; Jordan's gifts are wrapped in the wrong packaging, just like her orange construction paper essay.

King's writing is so vivid, so immediate, that her opening sparked flashbacks of my own time in such classrooms, but sexism is just the way things are, not the subject of this intensely moving novel. Heart the Lover is both a prequel and a sequel to King's novel, Writers & Lovers, which made my ""best of the year"" list in 2020. ""Jordan"" is the nickname that those two clever college boys give Casey Peabody, who some of us readers have met already in Writers & Lovers.

In that earlier novel, Casey is older, a 31-year-old who's been waitressing and writing her first novel for over six years. Heart the Lover suggests a big reason why Casey would have been stuck in her 20s. But the structure of Heart the Lover is so ingenious, its emotional charge so compelling, you don't have to have read the earlier novel to be drawn into what's essentially a great triangular love story.

The young Casey (again, here nicknamed Jordan) is pursued by Sam and then by his best friend, the other star student in that classroom, a boy named Yash. The ""first love"" erotic energy between Jordan and Yash is off the charts and the two envision an artsy adult life together in New York. Yash, however, feels conflicted by his loyalty to Sam and by his need to safeguard his autonomy. Guess which way the seesaw tips and who gets crushed beneath?

I'll stop the plot summary there because readers deserve to experience for themselves the devastation of the final section of Heart the Lover, which takes place at a reunion of the now middle-aged trio in a dying man's hospital room. If you've ever lived through such a moment you'll appreciate how King renders the all of it: the banality of visitors' small talk; the unreal sense of melodrama, the sporadic awareness that a deadline for final conversations is approaching.

Heart the Lover is about screwing up, wising up, finding yourself and realizing what you may have lost in the process. To quote Elena Ferrante, another great chronicler of women's lives, Heart the Lover is also about the ""velocity with which life is consumed.""",2025-11-03 00:00:00,irony,"Ironic quotes around ""s lives, heart the lover is also about the "" with negative context",irony,figurative,1,figurative,0.062186595,0.93781346,0.93781346,True
NBC News Think,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/vaccine-children-exemption-data-measles-methodology-rcna229853,Behind the data: Tracking the rate of vaccination and school exemptions,"This year's lethal spread of measles in rural West Texas and other pockets of the U.S. was a strong warning about how protection against deadly childhood diseases is eroding around the nation.

This was a key conclusion of a six-month NBC News investigation, in collaboration with Stanford University, resulting in the most comprehensive analysis of vaccinations and school exemptions to date.

NBC News gathered massive amounts of data from state governments and archives of public records reaching back years or decades. With the help of infectious disease researchers at Stanford, NBC News filed scores of requests for documents, including materials obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, and wrestled different types of data into a standardized format to map and compare rates across thousands of counties.

The analysis found that a large swath of the U.S. currently does not have the basic, ground-level immunity medical experts believe is necessary to stop the spread of measles, which had once receded into the past.

NBC News data investigation: How progress against childhood diseases is backsliding. The Vaccine Divide: Much of the U.S. currently doesn't have the protection needed to prevent outbreaks, the monthslong investigation reveals. One key finding of the analysis is stunning.

St. Louis offers a window into the overwhelming problem communities face nationwide.

How protected is your community? Search for current vaccination exemption rates in thousands of counties across the U.S. and see how the numbers have changed over time.

The idea for this project originated from a conversation about how to cover changes in vaccine policy and opinion between the NBC News Health and Medical unit and Dr. Peter Hotez, a vaccine expert and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Dallas.

The conversation led to infectious diseases scientist Dr. Nathan Lo at Stanford University, who had mapped out vaccination and exemption data in a few states. Lo became a collaborator in this monthslong data project, helping identify the limitations of the broader state-level vaccination trends that are collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Outbreaks start locally

We put vaccination trends under a microscope, down to the county level. The findings could help public health officials better predict where the next outbreak may occur and how to best allocate resources to stop it.

Or parents of children at high risk of complications from infectious diseases could find out if their community is a potential hot spot.

The analysis has identified unexpected trends.

For example, St. Louis, a diverse, major metropolitan area, is in the midst of a slide in immunization rates. That’s why it is a reporting focus.

These findings uncover a fracture in an already fragmented society: The vaccine divide.

Our Methodology

How NBC News collected the data

NBC News built a database of kindergarten vaccination and exemption information using data provided by state governments, primarily health agencies. The data combines public information available for some states and data provided directly to NBC News.

The data covers kindergartner vaccinations for each academic year.

After collection, the data was collated and exemption rates were calculated in order to be analyzed. The analysis focuses on four facets of the data:

Medical exemptions: Exemptions granted when students have a medical condition that would make vaccination potentially harmful. Nonmedical exemptions: Exemptions for students who opt out of required vaccinations due to personal beliefs or religious convictions. MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) vaccinations: For states in which data is subdivided by number of doses, MMR vaccination is counted by the second dose. Up-to-date vaccinations: Students are considered “up-to-date” with their vaccinations if they have received the full vaccination series required for enrollment in their school.

How the data was processed

With a hodgepodge of formats, jurisdictions and collection practices across states, the task required extensive work to ensure that possible inconsistencies in the data were managed.

Certain states, such as Ohio and New York, required further calculations to aggregate the state-supplied data.

Other states required hand input of hundreds of rows of tabular data.

All data was checked for accuracy.

Analyzing the data

Each state collects its data differently. Some use health districts instead of counties. Some states provided over a decade of data, others only two years. Some states redacted certain data due to privacy concerns.",2025-09-18 20:50:24.182000+00:00,literal,Factual reporting on data and policy,literal,literal,0,literal,0.98062056,0.01937946,0.98062056,True

NPR

It feels fitting, in a way, that so many notable books this week are premised on endings — of lives, relationships, eras, even. After all, Armistice Day, or Remembrance Day — also known as Veterans Day in the U.S. – is Tuesday. The day annually marks the end of one of history's most catastrophic conflicts, World War I.

For the most part, the endings that animate many of this week's new novels don't seek such world-historical consequence. Ann Packer, Quiara Alegria Hudes and the other authors who grace the list below are concerned with much more intimate details, the kind you're more likely to encounter just down the street than on a battlefield or at an international summit.

That said, the twisty history of currency — the subject of this week's one nonfiction entry in the roundup — reinforces a lesson learned with the peace of 1918: Beware of endings; they have the odd habit of being yet another beginning in disguise.

Some Bright Nowhere, by Ann Packer

Ann Packer's first novel in a decade finds the American author again pursuing a deceptively simple premise: A long-married couple must prepare for and confront their final weeks together before death comes for one of them. But don't be fooled by the saccharine-sounding summary. As Fresh Air's Maureen Corrigan explained in a review of Packer's previous novel, The Children's Crusade, the author has a knack for turning what might have been ""mundane mass-market fiction"" into a rich, splintered narrative that ""illuminate[s] the unexpected depths of the commonplace.""

Though her name is new to the adult fiction shelf, the veteran playwright penned the book for the Tony-winning musical In the Heights, wrote the screenplay for its 2021 film adaptation and won the 2012 Pulitzer Prize for her play Water by the Spoonful, about the return of an Iraq war veteran. In The White Hot, she explores a departure, in the voice of a young mother who tries to understand and explain her decision to leave her family for the freedom of a one-way ticket far, far away.

Laing's writing roams a Venn diagram of memoir, art criticism, history and fiction, rarely pursuing just one genre without including at least some elements of the others. Her memoir The Lonely City, for instance, wove the stuff of academic journals into a chronicle of her life in New York City. Her only previous novel, Crudo, dressed up in the persona of author Kathy Acker for an exercise that NPR's reviewer admiringly called a ""memoir in drag."" For its part, The Silver Book, though a novel, sets its inventions in an especially consequential – and controversial – era of Italian cinema: the final year or two before the brutal, unsolved murder of director Pier Paolo Pasolini.

People celebrating this holiday weekend may have different ideas about what sparked the American Revolution: a yearning for liberty; a revulsion at taxation without representation; or a desire to have a national sport where players can touch the ball with their hands.

And of course, disdain for King George III. ""He has plundered our seas,"" America's Founders wrote in the Declaration of Independence, ""ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.""

Today's British monarchy might not be powerful enough to fix a traffic ticket for a prince. But the royal family can still be potent influencers, as we use the term today.

This week it was announced that starting next year, the Prince and Princess of Wales will begin to grant the Royal Warrants that confer the crown's seal of approval on certain goods and services.

King Charles and Queen Camilla have granted more than 400 such warrants, and it's interesting to sift through the list of what met royal muster.

The list includes familiar British names, like Bentley and Jaguar motorcars, Burberry outfitters, Smythson Stationers, Turnbull and Asser Shirtmakers, and Twining's Tea and Coffee.

But there's also the ribbon and tassel manufacturer Cole Fabrics — the royal family must go through a lot of tassels — the artisanal Besom Broom and Pea Stick maker A. Nash, Change Waste Recycling Management Services, and Milborrow Chimney Sweeps. Buckingham Palace alone has hundreds of chimneys. Chim-Chim-Cheree!

""In luxury brand marketing,"" Professor Qing Wang of the University of Warwick in Coventry, England, told us, ""the image of the British royal family coats of arms is a strong cue for quality, a touch of class that makes it popular, even especially among American consumers.""

And so it may not surprise that this week the JL Partners polling firm released a survey of 1,000 U.S. voters in which 19% said they favor replacing the sitting U.S. President with the British monarch. More than one in three of 19 to 29-year-olds surveyed said they would favor a restoration of royalty.

NBC News Think,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cold-and-flu/flu-season-just-beginning-doctors-are-already-high-alert-rcna245148,"Flu season is just beginning, but doctors are already on high alert","The flu has started spreading earlier than usual in some parts of the country, prompting concerns that cases could soon erupt as millions of Americans travel and gather for Thanksgiving and other upcoming holidays.

The warning signs come as a form of the virus, called H3N2 subclade K, has set off massive outbreaks in Canada and the U.K.

Dr. Cameron Wolfe, an infectious disease specialist at Duke University School of Medicine in Durham, North Carolina, said he’s noted a sharp increase in flu cases over the past few weeks.

“Typically, I might see one or two cases a week at this point,” Wolfe said. “At the moment, we’ve had two, three, four per day coming in.”

Alicia Budd, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s domestic influenza surveillance team, said: “We certainly do expect we’re going to see influenza activity increasing over the next several weeks.”

The majority of flu circulating so far this season in the U.S. is the H3N2 strain, according to the CDC. H3N2 flus tend to cause more hospitalizations and deaths in older adults.

An early uptick in cases, Wolfe said, can create unique risks for this age group.

“If you’re seeing a really early flu season, you run the risk that some nursing homes may not have finished their vaccine deployments. Maybe a hospital hasn’t fully vaccinated its staff,” Wolfe said. “The community in general may not be as protected as it might have been if a virus turns up in January, for example.”

While flu activity is considered low overall, the CDC’s latest flu report shows cases are on the rise. The agency estimates that at least 650,000 people have had the flu so far this season. Around 7,400 people have been hospitalized and 300 have died, according to the report.

The uptick in cases and emergency room visits are occurring mostly in children, Budd said.

Last year, 280 children in the U.S. died from the flu. It was the deadliest flu season ever recorded for children, aside from the 2009-10 H1N1 pandemic.

No pediatric deaths have been reported so far this season. Still, the early rise in flu activity is unsettling for doctors who spent last winter watching the virus sweep through schools, day cares and, consequently, hospitals.

“It feels like the calm before the storm,” said Dr. Buddy Creech, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee. “We may have a difficult influenza year.”

The H3N2 strain is known for its ability to mutate easily. The subclade K form of the strain popped up over the summer with a handful of mutations. It emerged after the makeup of this season's flu shots had been set.

Budd, of the CDC, said the agency is studying how well the flu vaccine matches this latest flu strain. Still, she encouraged people to get the shot.

The majority of flu circulating so far this year is an A strain, called H3N2, according to the CDC. H3N2 is known for its ability to mutate easily.

This particular H3N2 variant, referred to as subclade K, popped up over the summer, after the makeup of this year’s flu shots had been set. It’s already caused massive outbreaks in Canada and the U.K.

Budd said the agency is studying how well the flu vaccine matches this latest flu strain. Still, she encouraged people to get the shot.

“Even in years where the strain in the vaccine may not be as similar to the strains that we’re seeing circulating, we know that the vaccine can help prevent severity of illness,” Budd said.

Doctors across the U.S. are closely monitoring increases in flu cases.

“Does it turn on our antenna a little bit more? Yes,” said Dr. Daniel Varga, chief physician executive at Hackensack Meridian Health in New Jersey. “It makes us be even more vigilant at looking at the traditional monitoring we do locally.”

Dr. Melanie Kitagawa, medical director of the pediatric intensive care unit at Texas Children’s Hospital in Houston, said it’s still not too late to get a flu shot.

Ben Bland is the director of the Asia-Pacific Program at Chatham House, an international policy think tank based in London. He is also the author of two books on Asian politics.

Even before President Trump returned to the White House earlier this year, conversations with diplomatic and security officials across Europe and Asia revealed a deep contradiction. On the one hand, U.S. allies fear the breakdown of the international order that has underpinned their stability in recent decades. On the other, they are hesitant to invest in the structural changes needed to adapt to a more uncertain world.

Sponsor Message

But this may be changing. U.S. allies in Europe and the Indo-Pacific have shown an increasing willingness in recent months to coordinate and cooperate across a wide range of shared interests, from trade to defense and alliance management to China. As democratic middle powers that are committed to open trade and investment, the U.K., France and Germany, Washington's most important European allies, have much in common with Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea, the Indo-Pacific pillars of the U.S. alliance system.

The foreign ministers of these seven countries and Poland, another key European security player, met recently on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York, acknowledging that ""peace, security and resilience in the Indo-Pacific and Europe are becoming more intertwined"". Meeting in a new format, and without the U.S. present even while on U.S. soil, they promised to cooperate more closely on maritime security, cybersecurity, economic security, climate change and broader geopolitical uncertainties.

On economic policy, these countries are looking to shield themselves from Beijing's weaponization of its dominance in manufacturing and emerging technologies. They are also seeking better defenses against growing protectionist pressures emanating from the U.S., which pre-date the return of President Trump to the White House.

How can U.S. allies organize among themselves?

Whether or not autarky makes sense for a superpower like America, its allies in Europe and the Indo-Pacific will suffer in a world where barriers to trade and investment continue to rise. Large, advanced, open economies such as the U.K., France, Germany, Japan, South Korea and Australia will need to work much harder together in the coming years to defend the free flow of goods, services and investments.

One avenue for doing so is cooperation around the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), a regional trade agreement that was backed by Washington before President Trump withdrew in 2017. Australia, Japan, New Zealand and the U.K. are CPTPP members, while South Korea is considering joining, and the European Union has discussed deepening trade linkages with the CPTPP.

Another area where these nations could form a stronger coalition is technology. Both China and the U.S. are taking ever more assertive measures as they vie for leadership in key technologies from artificial intelligence and semiconductors to electric vehicle batteries. None of Washington's major allies have the financial heft or corporate base to compete in their own right. But they can pool knowledge and resources to try to ensure they are not left behind. And they can discuss how to prevent being isolated in a world of bifurcating technological systems and standards.

On defense and intelligence, there is clearly no substitute for the anchor role that Washington plays. However, European and Indo-Pacific allies are already expanding the linkages between themselves, rather than relying on the U.S. for leadership, connections and defense procurement. For example, instead of procuring fighters from the U.S., Italy, Japan and the U.K. are already working together to develop their own next-generation aircraft under the Global Combat Air Program. This could be the start of a broader push to interweave defense and security between allies in Europe and the Indo-Pacific.

Overcoming tensions and leading without a leader

This shift is not about severing ties with Washington. On the contrary, it is about reacting to changes in U.S. domestic politics, and ensuring that U.S. allies in Europe and the Indo-Pacific can make more meaningful contributions in their own right.

However, coordinating between middle powers in Europe and Asia without the heft of U.S. leadership will be challenging.

Within the EU, France and Germany still clash, with their own joint fighter jet program, the Future Combat Air System, in doubt because of political wrangling and commercial rivalry. The U.K. is mending fences with its European neighbors after Brexit but standing outside the EU makes defense and industrial cooperation difficult.

In the Indo-Pacific, the historical tensions between Japan and South Korea have in the past limited their ability to cooperate with the U.S. and other allies.

It will take vision to look beyond these tensions and smart leadership to find creative, flexible and cost-effective solutions. If U.S. allies in Europe and the Indo-Pacific fail to do more together, alone they will not have the resources or scale to thrive in these uncertain times.

Trump made no mention of any discussions on Taiwan. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs had earlier reported that Xi told Trump the return of the island to China was an “integral part of the post-war international order” forged in the joint US-China fight against “fascism and militarism”.

Xi’s overtures came as his country faced off against Japan over the future of the self-governing island, which China considers its territory. Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi recently said Japan’s military could intervene militarily in any attack on Taiwan.

According to China’s Foreign Ministry, Trump told Xi that the US, which does not officially recognise Taiwan’s claim to statehood, yet remains the island’s most important partner and arms supplier, “understands how important the Taiwan question is to China”.

The phone call also coincided with the Trump administration’s latest push to end the war in Ukraine. China has positioned itself as a neutral party in the conflict. In Monday’s call, Xi said he supported “all efforts that are conducive to peace”, expressing hope that the crisis be resolved “at its root”, according to the Foreign Ministry.

The conversation came nearly one month after the two men met in person in the South Korean city of Busan as a trade war between the two countries rocked international markets.

A tentative deal reached in October’s meeting saw Beijing agree to suspend export restrictions on critical minerals for one year.

Washington said it would cut back tariffs on Chinese products and that Beijing would up purchases of soya beans from US farmers after shunning the product for months.

Trump said on Monday that he had spoken about “Fentanyl, Soybeans and other Farm Products” with his Chinese counterpart.

“We have done a good, and very important, deal for our Great Farmers – and it will only get better,” Trump wrote, without providing further details.",2025-11-24 00:00:00,literal,Factual reporting on reporting and economics,literal,literal,0,figurative,0.48251814,0.51748186,0.51748186,False
The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/nov/24/diaries-artworks-auctioned-marianne-faithfull-personal-belongings-carrie-fisher,"Diaries, artworks and more to be auctioned from Marianne Faithfull’s personal belongings","Diaries and a gift from actor Carrie Fisher are among the personal items from Marianne Faithfull that are going up for auction in London.

The musician died in January aged 78, leaving behind a cache of fascinating portraits, photographs and ephemera from a glamorous, sometimes troubled life. “Each piece tells a story and reflects her spirit and inimitable taste,” her son Nicholas Dunbar said. “It is time now for these belongings to find new homes and I hope that they will bring as much joy to their new owners as they did Marianne.”

The diaries include one from 1959 when Faithfull was in her early teens, and a 1989 journal entitled Goals. Artworks include a print by South African artist Marlene Dumas with the inscription “Say it in Broken English”, a reference to one of Faithfull’s most iconic lyrics; Babylon, a work on paper by Anita Pallenberg, who was in Faithfull’s social circle alongside the Rolling Stones; and Abductee, a collage by Australian pop artist Martin Sharp.

Furniture from the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries is up for sale, along with items from Faithfull’s wardrobe, including a Louis Vuitton by Marc Jacobs black wool coat.

A trunk belonging to Fisher and gifted to Faithfull is expected to sell for between £1,000 and £1,500.

The singer and actor were “very, very close” according to the singer Rufus Wainwright, who paid tribute to Faithfull in the Guardian after her death. “I had several wild evenings seated between them, kind of along for the ride. They were completely classic, original legends, who seemed to live in a universe all their own, and it was very decadent, incredibly funny and totally rock’n’roll.”

Faithfull became an icon of swinging-60s London, with pop hits including As Tears Go By and an acting career with roles opposite the likes of Orson Welles and Alain Delon. She was a muse to the Rolling Stones and co-wrote the song Sister Morphine, which she recorded and was covered by the Stones on Sticky Fingers.

But she became addicted to cocaine and heroin, and spent some years homeless in London, before getting clean in the 1980s and rebuilding her music career, going on to record with artists including Nick Cave, Damon Albarn and Metallica.

The auction items are on view at Bonham’s in Knightsbridge as part of their Sound & Cinema auction, which will run until 3 December. The auction house’s pop culture specialist Rebecca Anthony heralded Faithfull as “a cultural icon with an exceptional sense of style and lasting legacy, we are delighted to bring items from her personal collection to auction for the first time”.",2025-11-24 00:00:00,metaphor,Rocks used as metaphor for causes disruption,metaphor,figurative,1,literal,0.863796,0.13620399,0.863796,False

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/23/the-guardian-view-on-animal-testing-we-can-stop-sacrificing-millions-of-lives-for-our-own-health#comments,The Guardian view on animal testing: we can stop sacrificing millions of lives for our own health | Editorial,"Science is a slaughterhouse. We rarely acknowledge the degree to which animal life underwrites the research that provides us with medicines, or the regulation that keeps us safe. Live animals were used in 2.64m officially sanctioned scientific procedures in the UK in 2024, many of them distressing or painful and many of them fatal. But the government’s new strategy to phase out animal testing – published earlier this month – suggests that in the near future emerging technologies can largely replace the use of animals in our scientific endeavours.

The UK previously banned cosmetics testing on animals, and has already taken steps to regulate and reduce their use in research. But some needlessly cruel experiments still take place: the forced swim test (FST) for example, in which a rodent is placed in a body of water it cannot escape and researchers measure whether antidepressants extend the time it struggles for life. The government says no new FST licences will be granted, in effect banning it. Similar targets are set over the next few years to end the testing of caustic chemicals on eyes and skin.

This is welcome, but there are many other widespread practices – such as giving mice tumours to research cancer – which most people would still consider acceptable, despite their obvious barbarity. When animal wellbeing is pitted so starkly against human benefit, our collective compassion has a limit. The government will succeed only if it can convince scientists and the public that these longstanding and trusted experimental methods can be replaced with something as good or better.

Fortunately, there are emerging alternatives. So-called organ-on-a-chip systems, which use lab-grown cells arranged into a miniature network that can simulate complex bodily systems, are already in use. And machine learning systems are proving as adept at predicting potential toxic effects from medicines as they have been at predicting protein structures. These approaches won’t always provide perfect insight into how a given treatment might work for humans, but of course neither do animal tests. Undergraduate scientists are still taught these classic cautionary tales: paracetamol is toxic to dogs and cats, while thalidomide was shown to be safe in rats.

Unlike the slogans and aspirations in its AI strategy, the government appears to have a real plan for applying these technologies. There is £60m in direct funding committed– and a focus on identifying specific animal research methods currently in use, measuring their effectiveness and validating animal-free alternatives that could provide similar results. And it is heartening that the strategy maps out several points over the next decade when specific alternative methods are expected to mature, rather than gesturing at technology in general as a panacea.

This is an opportunity for both scientific and economic progress. Animal testing isn’t just cruel, it is expensive and time-consuming. The EU and US have similarly committed to reduce animal experimentation, so there will be rewards for developing technology and knowhow that can be applied worldwide. But most importantly, there is a moral imperative to free these animals. Previous governments greatly reduced the number of so-called charismatic species – animals favoured by humans such as dogs and horses – used in experiments. Today, 95% of lab animals in the UK are rodents, birds or fish.

toggle caption Andrew Harnik/Getty Images

Today, NPR will lose access to the Pentagon because we will not sign an unprecedented Defense Department document, which warns that journalists may lose their press credentials for ""soliciting"" even unclassified information from federal employees that has not been officially approved for release. That policy prevents us from doing our job. Signing that document would make us stenographers parroting press releases, not watchdogs holding government officials accountable.



No reputable news organization signed the new rule — not mainstream outlets like NPR, The Washington Post, CNN, and The New York Times, nor the conservative Washington Times or the right-wing Newsmax, run by a noted ally of President Trump. Some 100 resident Pentagon press will be barred from the building if they don't sign by the end of business on Tuesday.



I've held my Pentagon press pass for 28 years. For most of that time, when I wasn't overseas in combat zones embedding with troops, I walked the halls, talking to and getting to know officers from all over the globe, at times visiting them in their offices.

Sponsor Message

Did I as a reporter solicit information? Of course. It's called journalism: finding out what's really going on behind the scenes and not accepting wholesale what any government or administration says.

I remember how then-Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld was ecstatic after the fall of Baghdad in 2003, insisting that it showed the success of the U.S. invasion. Not long after, I ran into an officer at the Pentagon who told me, ""No, Tom. It's not a success. Saddam Hussein's supporters are attacking our supply lines. Now, we have to send more troops back to guard them."" That was because the United States, at Rumsfeld's insistence, never sent an adequate number of forces to Iraq to begin with — a fact another Army general warned me about, unsolicited — and I reported on, before the war even began.



Instead of toeing the official line, that reporting helped people understand what U.S. troops were really facing. Far from being a success, the fall of Baghdad marked the beginning of an insurgency that stretched on for years.

(Defense Department officials, by the way, have already restricted reporter movements in the Pentagon. They closed that particular hallway to reporters several months ago.)



In 2009, when the Obama administration announced a ""surge"" of State Department employees to Afghanistan to help the military keep the peace in restive, far-flung provinces, one Marine officer told me months later: ""If there was a surge, we never saw it."" And when the administration touted an Afghan ""government in a box,"" to bring experienced Afghans to the provinces, it proved to be a failure. One general told me: ""Next time they tell you there's a government in a box, check the box.""



Again, I reported both stories. That's my job.



Over the years, to be able to inform the public and hold the government to account for the wars being waged in Iraq and Afghanistan and the fight against the Islamic State in Syria, NPR reporters, producers, photographers and I have spent a lot of time in combat zones.

We got to know soldiers and Marines over the years while embedding with them, talking with them and getting their perspective, which was often far different from what we were told officially at the Pentagon. Sometimes officials at the Pentagon would declare progress or success. Out in dusty combat outposts or on patrols, we would learn the truth was far more complicated. I'm still in touch with many of those soldiers and Marines we met long ago. I'm having a beer with one of them the end of this week. They want the truth to get out, too.



In June 2016, U.S. officials were insisting that Afghan troops were making progress against the Taliban. I was part of a team of NPR reporters that embedded with Afghan forces to find out if that official line was indeed true, trying to get the ground truth about what had become America's longest war. We were travelling in an Afghan convoy in western Afghanistan when we were ambushed. I lost two friends and NPR lost two brave colleagues, photographer David Gilkey and translator Zabihullah Tamanna, that day. Producer and colleague Monika Evstatieva and I were in that convoy, took small arms fire, but were unharmed.



When we flew by helicopter to bring David and Zabi's bodies to a nearby American base, the U.S. general there ordered an honor cordon, a tribute that is usually reserved for fallen troops, not civilians from the United States and Afghanistan. Out of respect for two people who'd lost their lives in their line of duty, doing their jobs documenting the truth as journalists, U.S. soldiers lined up in the darkness on either side as David and Zabi were carried off the helicopter. I fought hard not to weep at one of the most decent, humane, and heartfelt gestures I've ever seen.

In NPR's lobby, there's a memorial to David and Zabi, including one of the cameras David was carrying that day, scorched and damaged.



So yes, we've received solicited and unsolicited information on everything from failed policies and botched military operations that led to unnecessary military and civilian deaths, to wasteful government projects that both Democratic and Republicans administrations would rather stay in the shadows.



That's our job.



Now, we're barely getting any information at all from the Pentagon. In the 10 months that the Trump administration has been in office, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has given just two briefings.

Sponsor Message

And there have been virtually no background briefings, which were common in the past whenever there has been military action anywhere in the world, as there has been with the recent bombings of Iran's nuclear facilities and of boats off the coast of Venezuela alleged to be carrying illicit drugs. In previous administrations, Defense Department officials — including the acerbic Rumsfeld — would hold regular press briefings, often twice a week. They knew the American people deserved to know what was going on.



Thomas Jefferson, no fan of the press himself, once wrote that our liberty depends on the freedom of the press, ""and that cannot be limited without being lost."" He knew a free and fair press is an essential safeguard to a functioning democracy.



So now, how will the American people find out what is being done at the Pentagon in their name, with their hard-earned tax dollars, and more importantly, the decisions that may put their sons and daughters in harm's way? With no reporters able to ask questions, it seems the Pentagon leadership will continue to rely on slick social media posts, carefully orchestrated short videos and interviews with partisan commentators and podcasters.



No one should think that's good enough.

They usually do. When not composing film soundtracks, or producing an eclectic range of other artists – the Weeknd, Anohni, Charli xcx, Soccer Mommy – Daniel Lopatin has released a string of acclaimed works, each with their own overarching idea.

The “hyperreal world music” of 2010’s Returnal was inspired by the fact that people now see more of the world than ever without actually leaving their homes. In 2015, Garden of Delete had an accompanying origin story about an adolescent humanoid alien called Ezra; 2018’s Age Of imagined artificial intelligence attempting to recreate human culture after humans themselves had been rendered extinct. Lopatin also has an all-consuming obsession with nostalgia and forgotten pop cultural artefacts: he’s made albums based around warped loops of 80s pop hits, preset sounds on obsolete synthesisers and recordings of US radio stations changing formats, discarding the musical genres in which they previously specialised in favour of the current vogue.

View image in fullscreen The artwork for Tranquilizer. Photograph: Warp Records

All of which makes Tranquilizer very much in the Oneohtrix Point Never wheelhouse. It feels not unlike a sequel to Replica, released 14 years ago. On that album, Lopatin drew on sounds from a collection of bootleg DVDs he bought online compiling old TV adverts from the 80s and 90s. Tranquilizer is constructed from a cache of old sample CDs – pre-packaged collections of royalty-free sounds that used to be sold to musicians and producers in the 90s and early 00s – that Lopatin found uploaded to the Internet Archive. An extra frisson came when, after bookmarking the page for future use, he discovered that it had been deleted. It subsequently reappeared, but it underlined the shakiness of the assumption that everything is preserved for ever in some corner of cyberspace.

There was something disorienting about the music on Replica, not least its use of minute snatches of spoken word: you’d hear the intake of breath and the first syllable of a voiceover, but the rest of the sentence would never appear, just a tiny fragment of its opening, looping or juddering. There’s something similarly unsettled about Tranquilizer. Sample CDs were frequently compiled along genre lines, labelled for use in drum’n’bass, or hip-hop, or house: from the start, the sounds on Tranquilizer strongly suggest that the CDs Lopatin downloaded were intended for those making ambient or new age music. For Residue opens with the sound of the ocean, some big, Pink Floyd-y guitar chords, wordless breathy vocals and thick, warm electronic tones. Elsewhere, you hear such obvious 90s ambient signifiers as tinkling windchime-like tones, Satie-esque piano figures, slow-paced non-specific “tribal” drums, the crackle of old vinyl and snatches of muted trumpet that recall the sound of late Brian Eno collaborator Jon Hassell. The synthesisers at the end of Modern Lust, meanwhile, are a dead ringer for those used on the KLF’s landmark album Chill Out.

Oneohtrix Point Never: Dis – video

Despite its title, Tranquilizer never feels particularly recumbent. Rather, it lulls the listener into a false sense of security with the familiarity of its sounds, then throws you for a loop. Sometimes the effect is straightforwardly unsettling, as when the patterns of the sounds on Bumpy run jarringly out of time, like a stuck record, or abruptly switch and change on Vestigel; or bend in pitch, lending a sickly, lightheaded air to Lifeworld. Sometimes the effect is overwhelming and euphoric: the shift during Rodl Glide, where a slow ooze of sound is dramatically replaced by full-on rave dynamics, or the sudden eruption of chattering synths midway through Dis. (In a startlingly Proustian period detail for listeners of a certain age, the track is also disrupted by the sound of speaker interference caused by an old 2G mobile phone.) Over five and half minutes, closer Waterfalls moves from windswept empty landscapes to busy urban propulsion, from passages that sound like the Japanese new age music collected on Visible Cloaks’ celebrated 2010 mix series Fairlights, Mallets and Bamboo to a burst of something that resembles an early 80s kids TV theme: the effect is heady and exhausting rather than relaxing.

For all the calm its source material was ostensibly intended to provoke, the record spends an hour in constant, agitated motion: chillout music transposed into an era where it’s increasingly difficult to chill out, where the constant bombardment of content and the dopamine hit of doomscrolling has made relaxing something we have to work at. Tranquilizer seems unlikely to help you calm down. It’s too kaleidoscopic and restless, too crammed with sounds: an album that demands – and repays – your full attention, rather than simply drifting by.

The United States government has designated what is known among Venezuelans as the “Cartel de los Soles” as a “terrorist organisation”, marking Washington’s latest effort to put pressure on President Nicolas Maduro as the US weighs up military action on land.

On November 16, the US Department of State declared that the Cartel de los Soles, or Cartel of the Suns, a term Venezuelans use to refer to officials engaged in corruption, would be added to the “foreign terrorist organization” (FTO) list from today. The US alleges the “cartel” is overseen by Maduro himself.

Speaking to One America News on Friday, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said the designation “brings a whole bunch of new options to the United States”, adding that Washington does not consider Maduro a legitimate leader.

While Washington claims Cartel de los Soles is overseen by the Venezuelan president and includes members of his inner circle, including in the military, Maduro denies any personal involvement in drug trafficking and even the existence of the alleged cartel.

In a statement responding to the move, Venezuela’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the action was a “ridiculous lie” used to justify future military intervention.

What is the Cartel de los Soles?

The US State Department alleges that the Cartel de los Soles, along with the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua criminal gang, is responsible for extensive drug-trafficking operations in the US and Europe.

According to the think tank InsightCrime, the name Cartel de los Soles emerged in the 1990s when Venezuelan generals and senior officers, who wore sun insignias on their epaulettes, were investigated for drug trafficking and related crimes.

Advertisement

Jeremy McDermott, codirector of InsightCrime, told CNN the cartel “is not a traditional, vertically organised drug-trafficking organisation. It is … a series of normally disconnected cells embedded within the Venezuelan military”.

Despite the allegations by President Donald Trump’s administration, the US Drug Enforcement Administration has never described the Cartel de los Soles as a drug-trafficking organisation in its annual National Drug Threat Assessment nor has the World Drug Report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.

What does the ‘terrorist’ designation mean?

There is no universally accepted definition of a drug cartel, but the term generally refers to a centrally controlled criminal organisation that operates across borders and uses violence to profit from illegal activities.

While the US Department of the Treasury has previously sanctioned the Cartel de los Soles, the new FTO designation gives the US government more powers to take action against it.

The designation criminalises all “support” for the Cartel de los Soles and bars its representatives from entering the US. As such, it is now a crime to provide funds to the group. And due to its alleged links with the military, that could potentially prevent foreign firms from doing business with the Venezuelan state.

The new classification also authorises diplomatic and financial penalties against the group, such as freezing its assets.

Crucially, the FTO designation bolsters the political and legal case for US military action in Venezuela, presenting an ostensible counternarcotics effort as part of a broader campaign for a change in government, analysts said.

Why has the US government taken this step?

The Trump administration has adopted an increasingly hard line towards Maduro, who claimed re-election in January despite accusations of fraud. Caracas banned Maduro’s main political rival, Maria Corina Machado, from running.

Washington, which has carried out a string of military strikes on Venezuelan boats it alleges are trafficking drugs in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, has not shared any evidence of Maduro’s direct involvement in drug trafficking. However, it continues to insist that the Venezuelan president is the head of the Cartel de los Soles and he is associated with Tren de Aragua.

In July, Trump’s national security adviser and secretary of state, Marco Rubio, accused Maduro of being “the leader of the designated narcoterrorist organisation Cartel de los Soles” and responsible for “trafficking drugs into the United States and Europe”.

In August, the US government raised its reward for information leading to Maduro’s arrest from $25m to $50m. But its characterisation of Maduro as a drug kingpin is seen by many – and by Maduro himself – as a way for the US to unseat him from power.

In October, Maduro accused the US of “fabricating a new war … [and] an extravagant narrative, a vulgar, criminal and totally fake one”. Maduro’s comments followed Trump’s announcement that he had authorised CIA operations in Venezuela.

Maduro said he believes Trump is aiming to reshape the political landscape in the Caribbean. If he falls, Maduro said, then US political foes in Cuba and Nicaragua could lose access to subsidised Venezuelan oil and could be destabilised.

What military action has the US taken?

Since September, the US has carried out a string of air strikes on what it says are drug-trafficking boats off the coasts of Venezuela and Colombia, amounting to the largest military deployment to the Caribbean in decades and killing at least 83 people.

Meanwhile, Washington has dispatched several warships, including the nuclear-powered super-carrier USS Gerald R Ford, the world’s largest and most advanced naval aircraft vessel, to the Caribbean Sea in recent weeks.

But Mark Cancian, a senior adviser to the defence and security programme at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, said the carrier is not designed for Trump’s mission, as described.

“The Ford is not well suited for counterdrug operations. … It’s well suited to attack adversaries either at sea or on land,” he posted in an analysis on X on November 14.

The show of force recalls a long history of military interventions and coup-mongering across Latin America by US governments, often motivated by fear of hostile powers close to US borders.

In recent decades, ties between Washington and Caracas have been dominated by tensions since the rise of Maduro’s left-wing predecessor Hugo Chavez. The relationship deteriorated further after Maduro came to power following Chavez’s death in 2013.

What will happen next?

Trump says he has “sort of” made up his mind about what to do in Venezuela but has not announced his decision yet.

Last week, when asked about the possibility of deploying US troops in Venezuela, Trump replied: “I don’t rule out that. I don’t rule out anything. We just have to take care of Venezuela.”

He told reporters on November 16 that “we may be having some discussions” with Maduro and “Venezuela wants to talk”, but he did not provide details.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2025/nov/24/australia-climate-fossil-fuels-anthony-albanese-gas-expansion,How can Australia convince the world to give up fossil fuels if Anthony Albanese is contradicting himself on gas expansion? | Bill Hare,"With another set of global climate talks behind us, the Australian government faces some tricky tasks before it takes over negotiations at the next round of talks next year in Turkey.



Cop30 in Belém, Brazil, did not deliver the bold fossil fuel phase-out roadmap we needed, but it did nudge the system forward with more scrutiny of fossil fuel producers.



And despite the weakness of the outcome, one can gain some important comfort by the fact that Bélem – and the G20 in Johannesburg at the weekend – both solidly endorsed the Paris agreement, its central goal of keeping warming to 1.5C and the importance of net zero emissions.



Cop30 agreed that an “ambition accelerator” will be needed to fill the gap between what governments are planning (projected to warm the world by 2.6C) and the agreed guardrails of the Paris agreement: a limit of 1.5C.



It also, crucially, began the momentum for developing a roadmap for a just transition away from fossil fuels, with more than 80 countries – including Australia – signing the “Belém declaration” on a transition away from fossil fuels.

While this declaration didn’t get support from the whole conference, Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has promised to move forward on its implementation during the course of this year, until he hands over to Cop31 in Turkey.

And there, Australia, under its deal with Turkey, will take over that momentum.

But there are significant questions as to whether the government will be able – or more importantly willing – to move this momentum for a fossil fuel phase-out forward.



This is especially so given that the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has just doubled down on his patently false claim that gas is needed for the energy transition.

The International Energy Agency released its annual report in the first week of Cop30. Its net zero emissions pathway confirms our concerns about Australian gas. The IEA’s new net zero scenario clearly states there is no need for new long-lead oil and gas projects, or coalmines.



It says fossil gas use needs to reduce quickly to 40% below today’s levels by 2035. Importantly, it also warns that a massive glut of liquefied natural gas supply is developing, a glut that is consistent with the IEA’s current policy scenario that would warm the world by 3C by 2100.



Gas is not needed to replace coal, and is not doing so across Asia – the destination for the vast majority of Australian fossil gas exports.



Add to this the leaked Deloitte draft report to the Western Australian government that warned Australia’s gas export bonanza to Asia would crowd out renewables and lock in CO 2 emissions for years to come.



Yet yesterday the prime minister was still dancing around this question, saying Australia’s gas would be needed as a backup to renewables but also that this “firming” would not require any new gas fields and should see the government move toward a phase-out of the massive export program it has approved all the way to 2070.

The truth is that much less gas is going to be needed to “firm” renewables, as grid-scale battery technologies take over the market.

In the next breath Albanese confirmed that his government would continue to allow new gas fields to go ahead, just as he allowed the massive North West Shelf development go ahead to 2070.



These two statements are in direct contradiction with each other and do not bode well for the prospect of his government moving forward a global agreement that aims to get the world to transition away from fossil fuels.

The IEA has also confirmed that carbon capture and storage is not the magic bullet Australia claims it is to deal with fossil gas emissions. Indeed our work shows that if Asian countries – and Australia – continue with expansion plans for deploying CCS, they could add an extra 25bn tonnes of CO 2 emissions to the atmosphere by 2050.

There are many in Australia’s political scene who ask, what does all of this have to do with us?



For those who love Australia’s bush, forests, coral reefs, marine life and ecosystems, I would say nearly everything. Because all of this depends on keeping warming to 1.5C.

This month we’ve also seen reports emerge of massive coral mortality at Ningaloo reef, caused by climate change-fuelled marine heatwaves. This reef and others like it are finished unless we can get fossil fuels phased out quickly and achieve net zero CO 2 in the next 25 years or so.



It’s physics. Getting to net zero CO 2 globally means we can halt global warming.

And getting to net zero CO 2 means rapidly phasing out fossil fuels. There’s simply no other way.

Australia cannot continue to develop and expand fossil fuel exports and pretend it’s going to be a renewable superpower supporting a 1.5C limit.

These contradictions will come into sharp focus over the next year and they are likely to get increasingly dangerous for the Albanese government as people wake up to the climate catastrophe unfolding around them, while watching their government fumble on the world stage.",2025-11-24 00:00:00,literal,Factual reporting on reporting and policy,literal,literal,0,literal,0.98808086,0.011919115,0.98808086,True
The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/nov/21/tobias-jesso-jr-interview-songwriter-shine-dua-lipa-justin-bieber-adele,‘Justin Bieber is an insanely courageous artist’: Tobias Jesso Jr on how he became the songwriter to the stars,"Goon, the 2015 debut album by Canada-born LA musician Tobias Jesso Jr, was one of the revelations of the 2010s. An album of heartfelt, earnest ballads in the vein of 70s singer-songwriters such as Randy Newman and Harry Nilsson, it instantly established Jesso as a rising indie star and was one of the year’s most acclaimed records. The problem was that Jesso didn’t care much for the attention: he struggled to feel like a genuine performer, leading him to drink heavily before shows, and felt he was playing a version of himself in interviews. “I was forced to do all these things I wasn’t really confident in,” he says. “I was just like … I don’t know what I’m doing, anywhere.” So, toward the end of his breakout year, he cancelled all future shows and, in essence, put his career on ice.

In the decade that followed, he kept himself behind the scenes, in the process becoming one of the world’s most successful and in-demand pop songwriters – thanks, in no small part, to his focus on simple, emotions-first songwriting. He co-wrote Adele’s hit When We Were Young and a handful of tracks on Dua Lipa’s 2024 album Radical Optimism; has collaborated with Harry Styles, Justin Bieber, FKA twigs and Haim; and in 2023 won the first ever Grammy for songwriter of the year.

Now, a decade on from his first record, and with little notice, Jesso has released Shine, its equally heartfelt follow-up. Speaking over Zoom from his home in Silver Lake, Los Angeles, he seems as surprised as anyone that he’s stepping back into the spotlight. “Getting into the songwriting thing, you learn all these tricks of the trade,” he says. “I had to forget all those and go: ‘What do I want to say? How do I want to say it?’ I knew with this, if I was really going to stand behind it, I needed to make [it] the uncompromised version of myself.”

At only eight tracks, totalling less than 30 minutes – all, once again, featuring only Jesso and his piano – Shine is a modest album. But its waters run deep, touching on his mother’s dementia diagnosis as well as fatherhood – Jesso shares a young son with his ex-wife, the Australian songwriter Emma Louise. He began to have an inkling that he wanted to write for himself again after his breakup earlier this year – a feeling he hadn’t experienced since he was writing Goon.

“I like to share my stories in [songwriting] sessions and use things from my life to fill in the gaps, but I never really felt like I had a whole song to say,” he says. “Before this album, I was doing sessions and going through a breakup, and I had to process a lot. I found myself not wanting to share special lines or things that would come to me because they were so rooted to me. I just had this gut knowing that I needed to work these songs out myself.”

Around the beginning of May, Jesso blocked six weeks out from his schedule – the longest break from his day-to-day songwriting work he’d ever taken – and set to work writing Shine. Some of the songs on the album are brand new; others are reworked from Jesso’s huge folder of unused ideas that he’s amassed over the past decade. The first song he finished was the album’s opening track, Waiting Around, a scorching postmortem of his breakup: “You were upset / Every other morning / Like a sharp knife / Had me dancing on edge,” he sings.

In recent years, pop has been dominated by tabloid-baiting pop that tempts listeners into trying to work out the real-life narrative behind the songs: think Olivia Rodrigo’s Drivers License, about a real-life love triangle, or Lily Allen’s recently released, much discussed West End Girl, a tell-all about her divorce from the actor David Harbour. Jesso says that he “didn’t want to fall on any tricks” when it came to writing about his personal life. “I didn’t want to use names or any little dates or stuff: I wanted to make it for me, a song that I felt like would convey exactly where I am and what I’m going through,” he says. “I wasn’t trying to be disrespectful … When I finished [that song], I was like: ‘Man, I just wrote one of my songs again, holy fuck! It’s amazing that I did that.’”

I want to find the artists who want to get a little bit more unique, not just chase something that’s already been done

One song on the album – the dramatic, intense I Love You, which builds to a clattering maelstrom – had a less conventional genesis. During a reading from Wendy L’Belle-Tividad, an LA psychic whose client list includes a number of high-profile musicians, Jesso was told that there was a song missing from Shine, which was “really dramatic”. The next time he was sitting at the piano, he wrote I Love You, undeniably the loudest and most dramatic song he’s ever written, building to an intense, alarming climax that sounds like a door slamming over and over. “That’s my favourite song I’ve written to date,” he says. “But here’s the thing: I’m like, was it inception or was it a psychic reading?”

While Shine does bear great resemblance to Goon – which definitely has something to do with Jesso’s distinctive, pleading timbre – it’s also undeniably the work of someone who has been in the pop trenches for the better part of a decade, in part because of the poppy structure of the songs and in part because of credited collaborators such as Tommy King and Julian Bunetta, fixtures of the LA pop scene. While Jesso says that, for the most part, he tried to ignore his big-budget pop instincts, he credits Justin Bieber, with whom Jesso worked on his recent albums Swag and Swag II, as a bolstering force.

“The sessions with Justin were right before I wrote this stuff, and he is the most insane, courageous artist – [he’ll] just get on a mic and start singing something, and it sounds like a song. It just happens so naturally,” he says. “[Working with him] was so raw compared with these pop sessions where they’re like: ‘What’s on the Top 40?’ – there was no trickery. It was mind-boggling that at his level, he was doing something that I was scared to do. It changed my perspective on a lot of things.”

Those kinds of sessions, he says, are rare. “I’m still disenchanted with how a lot of pop music gets made – it’s a little bit of a cop-out. I’ve been party to it as well, so I can safely say I also am embarrassed about being party to it,” he says. “I feel very grateful for [being] able to work with artists that I don’t feel like would ever put themselves into that sort of deplorable writing; the artists I choose to write with would also kind of cringe at a few of those Top 40 songs.”

He continues: “I’m not dogging anyone for writing pop songs in any way, you know? Write all the pop songs you want. Maybe it is about money.” Jesso does not name names, but it’s easy enough to conjure the kind of music he’s talking about: disposable, trend-chasing pop that’s heavily reliant on samples or references, or which simply rehashes older, well-trodden ideas. “I want to find the artists who don’t agree with that and maybe want to get a little bit more unique and push a little bit more, and not just stay in the zone where you’re chasing something that’s already been done.”

View image in fullscreen Shine on … Tobias Jesso Jr. Photograph: Justin Chung

One such artist he’s worked with recently is Olivia Dean, the Brit School graduate whose second album, The Art of Loving, released in September, is one of the year’s genuine breakout records. Dean recently sold out four dates at the O2 in London, with two more on their way there; Man I Need, a 70s-ish lounge single co-written by Jesso, peaked at No 5 on the US Hot 100 chart. “Olivia is a great example of … Some people you just meet and you just go: ‘You got it – you’re a force,’” he says. “You can see when someone carries their own integrity and their own assurance of what they’re doing, and for a songwriter, that’s the most exciting thing. Somebody who’s very strong in their opinion is like a godsend to me.”

Even so, Jesso says artists such as Bieber and Dean are probably outliers. “I don’t know that the pendulum seems like it’s gonna swing back to like, 70s-style songwriting or quality – putting it in for the craft – with AI and everything that’s happening now,” he says. “It’s gonna get a lot worse. People are already using AI for everything, so it’s like: cool now it’s not even gonna be human.”

Although Jesso prefers to be the only songwriter in a room with an artist, there are exceptions where he doesn’t mind being one of a handful of credited songwriters, as was the case when working on Dua Lipa’s Radical Optimism. “Going in with Dua and getting to work with Dua, and getting to work with Kevin [Parker of Tame Impala], getting to work with Danny [L Harle], and all these people, it’s like a dream. Having names on the board doesn’t matter if they’re all people you really want to work with,” he says. It was a similar experience, he says, working in France with Bieber and his collaborators. “Usually when you see 10 names on a song, you’re going: ‘Probably four of those didn’t do shit. Or just changed a word.’ But those motherfuckers put themselves on the line for all of those songs – every name on there is a name that should be on there.”

Working on Shine hasn’t changed the fact that Jesso still wants to keep his day job as a behind-the-scenes songwriter, though he’s due for another upheaval. He’s about to move to a farm he owns in Byron Bay, Australia, where he plans to spend half the year in order to be close to his son, who’s about to start school there. “I’ve got a few close friends close by, which is really good, but it’s going to be a big new start and a big change. I guess there’s a lot of space for not really knowing if it’s going to be filled with joy or sadness,” he says. “Over the last five years, I’ve tried to find a way to bring more life into the mix, more than just work, because I think for a long period of time in my life, it was just all work – it was an obsession, almost. This is sort of a big test: can I handle months of life without too much work?”

Shine won’t require too much of the stuff he hated circa Goon – he’s doing few interviews and will probably only play one or two shows, “just to show people the songs … like, three-song sets”, he says. “I don’t know that performing will ever be me; it just doesn’t feel like something that’s ever me. I don’t think I see myself in front of an audience,” he says. “I’m getting ready and prepared for the move, but you know, if I’m like, depressed in Australia, I’m gonna have my piano – maybe I write a bunch more songs, maybe I don’t.”

Or, to put it even more succinctly: “I think 10 years away for me is pretty comfortable.”

Susan Stamberg once began an interview with an orchestra conductor by asking a question she confessed she'd always wanted to ask someone in his line of work: ""Don't your arms get tired?""

Maestro Jorge Mester of the Louisville Orchestra told her, ""You know it's the most obvious question and never gets asked."" He said his right arm was a little heavy, but added that only unemployed conductors' arms get tired. His stayed in good condition.

Listening to Susan Stamberg reminded us that often the best questions are short, simple, and open-minded. She has been the master of that art.

And many of us at NPR feel that we are here today because of Susan Stamberg.

She gave personality to a fledgling network that was almost an afterthought in the Public Broadcasting Act.

News voices in the 1970s tended to be somber, accent-less, and almost exclusively male. Susan Stamberg became the first woman ever to anchor a daily national evening news broadcast in the U.S., when she began to co-host All Things Considered in 1972. She was serious as the news required. But she was also curious, relentless, and utterly delightful.

Susan's voice made Americans say: ""They sound different, don't they?"" Her voice has been sharp, sometimes saucy, and could be silken — then let out a bell-ringing laugh.

She turned, ""What is NPR?"" into ""Have you heard NPR?""

Today, there are women at all ranks and responsibilities in what we now call ""media,"" working as correspondents, anchors, news directors, CEOs and more.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/global/commentisfree/2025/nov/24/macron-and-merz-europe-slide-far-right#comments,Macron and Merz must look at themselves if they want to stop Europe sliding to the far right,"Europe’s leaders cannot stop talking about democracy. President Emmanuel Macron says he wants to kickstart a democratic “resurgence”, and Friedrich Merz, the German chancellor, has warned of an “axis” of autocratic states targeting liberal democracy in Europe. Having promised to “fight” for what she calls European “values”, Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, has just announced a new “democracy shield” and a Centre for Democratic Resilience to prevent foreign interference and deal with external threats. I keep hoping for similar scrutiny of democratic backsliding within the EU – but so far it has not happened.

Foreign interference, disinformation and the creeping illiberalism of Hungary, Poland and Slovakia deserve attention. But lost in this fretting is a more inconvenient truth: within Europe’s “mature” democracies, there is a steady corrosion of the rule of law, a degradation of political discourse and the normalisation of racism, xenophobia and discrimination.

Growing up in a country where democracy was fragile and frequently interrupted, I learned early that the issue is not merely about elections. It is about the quality of governance and of politicians. It depends on protecting human rights and dignity, ensuring social justice, respecting minorities – and minority views – and creating a genuine sense of belonging for all citizens.

That is why I am troubled when EU governments and political elites undermine the rule of law, constrain free speech, normalise police violence and ignore signs that racism and xenophobia have seeped into public life. Across the bloc, the demonisation of racialised refugees and migrants has become common. Ironically, even as they champion democratic renewal, Merz, Macron and von der Leyen are chipping away at the very values they claim to defend.

When Merz urged journalists to “ask your daughters” about why Germany’s changing “cityscape” threatens their security, he did more than infantilise German women. He activated toxic colonial and orientalist tropes of Black and brown men as violent, hypersexual, uncivilised aggressors, as bodies to be policed, controlled and deported. Though he later acknowledged migrants’ economic contributions, the damage was done. Merz moved Germany’s Overton window on what is considered acceptable in political discourse, thereby giving more oxygen to the far right.

In France, too, Macron’s legacy will be marked not only by his attempts at liberal reforms but by his legitimisation of far-right narratives. By echoing Marine Le Pen’s rhetoric on national identity, Islam and migration, Macron has normalised what was once unsayable for centrists. The far-right National Rally now stands as a respectable government-in-waiting precisely because the so-called liberal centre helped embed its ideas in the mainstream.

A similar dynamic is playing out within EU institutions. Italy’s Giorgia Meloni may have set the shameful example by outsourcing the processing of asylum seekers to Albania, but it is the European Commission that has incorporated deportation as a legitimate policy tool in the EU’s new migration pact – and von der Leyen who keeps signing migration-deterrence deals with regimes such as those in Tunisia and Egypt that are accused of abuse and torture.

Israel’s genocide in Gaza has laid bare the many ways in which the EU is in violation of its own norms and principles, as well as in flagrant breach of its obligations under international law to prevent and punish genocide. In Germany, police forces have been condemned by UN experts for criminalising and suppressing legitimate Palestinian solidarity activism. In Belgium, the use of teargas, batons and water cannon against peaceful protesters outside the European parliament prompted calls for an investigation from Amnesty International. EU institutions are quick to condemn state violence in other parts of the world, but are silent when it occurs within their own borders.

After every European election, we reassure ourselves that the “centre is holding”. The reality is that whether in national governments or in the European parliament, far-right parties are increasingly shaping the European agenda. The conservative European People’s party has grown ever-more comfortable forming majorities with far-right groups, especially on environmental policy. Politicians across Europe are adopting far-right talking points on migration and Muslims. The excuse is always that this is being done to contain the hardliners, even though studies consistently show that such mimicry amplifies and normalises extremism.

Still, there are glimmers of hope. Spain’s Pedro Sánchez has shown moral clarity on Gaza and adopted a national migration policy which is rooted in dignity and solidarity. In the Netherlands, Rob Jetten of the centre-left D66, expected to lead a new coalition, ran on a platform of hope rather than hate and spoke out against Israel’s genocide. The UK Green party’s Zack Polanski and Ireland’s new president Catherine Connolly are helping to revive a progressive political discourse in their countries. And across the Atlantic, New York’s new mayor, Zohran Mamdani, a proud son of immigrants and unapologetic advocate for justice, housing and solidarity, has demonstrated that democracy’s vitality depends on moral courage and inclusive coalitions – and that racial and religious identity can be a source of pride.

Al Jazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/11/25/elite-capture-how-pakistan-is-losing-6-percent-of-its-gdp-to-corruption,‘Elite capture’: How Pakistan is losing 6 percent of its GDP to corruption,"New IMF report prompts calls for corruption reforms. But experts say that needs political will, not technical tinkering.

Islamabad, Pakistan – A new assessment by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has concluded that corruption in Pakistan is behind an economic crisis driven by “state capture” – where public policy is manipulated to benefit a narrow circle of political and business elites.

The Governance and Corruption Diagnostic Assessment (GCDA), finalised in November 2025, presents a grim picture of a system marked by dysfunctional institutions that are unable to enforce the rule of law or safeguard public resources.

According to the 186-page report, corruption in Pakistan is “persistent and corrosive”, distorting markets, eroding public trust and undermining fiscal stability.

The report, requested by the Pakistani government, warns that without dismantling the structures of “elite privilege”, the country’s economic stagnation will persist.

While corruption vulnerabilities are present at all levels of government, according to the report, “the most economically damaging manifestations involve privileged entities that exert influence over key economic sectors, including those owned by or affiliated with the state.”

The report argues that Pakistan stands to gain substantial economic benefits if governance improves and accountability is strengthened. Such reforms, it notes, could significantly lift the country’s gross domestic product (GDP), which stood at $340bn in 2024.

“Based on cross-country analysis of the reform experience of emerging markets, IMF analysis projects that Pakistan could generate between a 5 to 6.5 percent increase in GDP by implementing a package of governance reforms over the course of five years,” the report said.

Stefan Dercon, a professor of economic policy at the University of Oxford who has advised the Pakistani government on economic reforms, said that he agreed that the absence of accountability in corruption cases was eating away at the country’s economic potential.

“Failure of implementation [of laws and principles of accountability] gives vested interests too often free rein and addressing this must be at the core of efforts for economic reform,” he told Al Jazeera.

Here is what we know about the IMF report, the areas of weakness it highlights, the policy recommendations it makes, and what the experts say.

What does the IMF report say?

Pakistan has turned to the IMF 25 times since 1958, making it one of the fund’s most frequent borrowers. Nearly every administration, whether military or civilian, has sought IMF assistance, reflecting chronic balance of payments crises.

The current programme was started under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.

The GCDA’s release comes ahead of the IMF executive board’s expected approval of a $1.2bn disbursement next month, part of the ongoing 37-month-long, $7bn programme.

Pakistan narrowly avoided default in 2023, surviving only after the IMF extended an earlier nine-month deal, which was followed by the ongoing 37-month programme.

According to the GCDA, Pakistan consistently ranks near the bottom of global governance indicators among nations. Between 2015 and 2024, the country’s score on control of corruption remained stagnant, placing it among the worst performers worldwide and within its neighbourhood.

At the heart of the IMF’s findings is the concept of “state capture”, where, according to the fund, corruption becomes the norm and, in fact, the primary means of governance. The report argues that the Pakistani state apparatus is frequently used to enrich specific groups at the expense of the broader public.

The report estimates that “elite privilege” – defined as access to subsidies, tax relief and lucrative state contracts for a select few – drains billions of dollars from the economy annually, while tax evasion and regulatory capture crowd out genuine private sector investment.

These findings echo a 2021 United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) report, which said economic privileges granted to Pakistan’s elite groups, including politicians and the powerful military, amount to roughly 6 percent of the country’s economy.

Ali Hasanain, an associate professor of economics at the Lahore University of Management Sciences, said the IMF’s description of elite capture is accurate but added that it was “hardly a revelation”.

He pointed to the 2021 UNDP report and other domestic studies that describe how Pakistan’s economic system has long served politically connected actors who secure “preferential access to land, credit, tariffs and regulatory exemptions.”

“The IMF diagnostic repeats what many domestic studies, including those by the World Bank and Pakistan’s own institutions, have already emphasised: Powerful interests shape rules to maintain their advantage,” he told Al Jazeera.

The new report notes that tax expenditures, including exemptions and concessions granted to influential sectors such as real estate, manufacturing and energy, cost the state 4.61 percent of GDP in the 2023 fiscal year alone.

It also calls for an end to special treatment for influential public sector entities in government contracts and urges greater transparency in the functioning of the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC).

The SIFC, created in June 2023 during Sharif’s first term, is a high-powered body comprising civilian and military leaders and tasked with promoting investment by easing bureaucratic obstacles. Although positioned as a flagship initiative jointly owned by the government and the military, it has faced sustained criticism for a lack of transparency.

The report describes broad legal immunity granted to SIFC officials, many from the armed forces, as a major governance concern. It warns that this immunity, combined with the council’s authority to exempt projects from regulatory requirements, creates significant risks.

Highlighting the absence of transparency, the GCDA says the SIFC should publish annual reports with details of all investments it has facilitated, including concessions granted and the rationale behind them.

“The recently established Special Investment Facilitation Council, which has been vested with substantial authority to facilitate foreign investments, operates with untested transparency and accountability provisions,” the report said.

Judiciary and rule of law

The report identifies the judiciary as another critical bottleneck. Pakistan’s legal system is overwhelmed by more than two million pending cases. In 2023 alone, the number of unresolved cases before the Supreme Court increased by 7 percent.

Over the last 12 months, Pakistan has passed two constitutional amendments, both of which faced severe backlash from many in the legal community who said that they represent a “constitutional surrender”. In essence, the amendments create a parallel Federal Constitutional Court that critics say will reduce the powers of the Supreme Court, while also changing rules that guide how judges are appointed and transferred, in ways that opponents say could give the executive great control over whom to promote and whom to punish.

The government, however, has insisted that the changes were made to improve the efficiency and efficacy of the judicial system.

Similar credibility challenges affect the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) and the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), the two principal bodies responsible for investigating corruption.

The GCDA cites a 2024 government task force, which found that NAB has, at times, exceeded its mandate and launched politically motivated cases. This selective accountability, the report says, has damaged public trust and created a climate of fear within the bureaucracy, slowing decision-making.

While NAB says it recovered 5.3 trillion rupees ($17bn) between January 2023 and December 2024, the report notes that conviction rates remain low.

The diagnostic calls for fundamental reforms to NAB’s appointment processes to ensure independence and a shift from “political victimisation” to “rule-based enforcement”.

Was the report necessary?

The IMF outlines reforms which experts acknowledged would be comprehensive if pursued by authorities.

Yet analysts also note that international institutions and domestic researchers have repeatedly made similar observations in the past, with little follow-through by the government.

Sajid Amin Javed, a senior economist at the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) in Islamabad, says the fact that Pakistan is already under an IMF programme may compel the government to take the findings more seriously.

He said that the IMF report could have gone further than it has by acknowledging that many of its recommendations have been made by others in the past, “without bringing any change”.

“Perhaps the assessment could have been made to see why these failures happened,” he said.

Javed welcomed the report’s attempt to quantify economic losses from corruption, hoping it might push policymakers to act.

“Corruption and governance are intrinsically tied to each other. Corruption leads to weak governance, and weak governance promotes corruption, making them conjoined,” he said.

Hasanain, however, was more sceptical, questioning why the IMF waited for a formal request from the Pakistani government despite having its own internal assessment mechanisms.

What can the government do?

Analysts said Pakistan’s economic landscape has long been shaped by politically connected actors who enjoy preferential access to land, credit, tariffs and regulatory exemptions. The IMF’s observations, they noted, are not new.

Hasanain argues that corruption, including elite capture of markets, regulatory bodies and public policy, is political in nature and cannot be addressed without deeper reforms.

“Without a broader political awakening, governance reforms will remain technical fixes built on unstable foundations. Ultimately, elite capture is undone only when political incentives change,” he said.

Javed, meanwhile, pointed to what he called policy design capture, arguing that those responsible for drafting governance and anticorruption reforms are often part of the same elite ecosystem.

“Elite policy capture on policy design is perhaps the most important component which allows the elite capture. The report’s recommendations show that we must go for participatory and inclusive methods to get out of our current conundrum,” he said.

For Hasanain, the most urgent reform is a unified economic turnaround plan that is fully owned by the prime minister and communicated clearly.

He said that Pakistan’s economic landscape was cluttered with “committees, councils, task forces and overlapping ministries”, each producing its own documents without accountability.

“The government should consolidate these scattered structures into one clear reform platform with defined priorities, timelines and measurable outcomes. Progress should be published monthly, debated publicly, and subjected to independent scrutiny,” he said.

Hasanain argued that such consolidation would improve coordination, build public trust and signal seriousness to investors.

For Javed, the most immediate priority is reforming the public procurement system, which governs how government bodies buy goods and services using public funds.

“Our procurement system is not working on value of money, but instead it focuses on quantity of money, where lowest bidder wins the bid,” he said, arguing that this approach meant that contracts often did not go to those best suited to deliver what was needed. “This system needs urgent modernisation.”

“An urgent realisation is the order of the day that if we need to have a flourishing, transparent economy, we have no choice but to overhaul our entire economic framework,” Javed said.",2025-11-25 00:00:00,literal,Factual reporting on reporting and data,literal,literal,0,literal,0.88464135,0.11535863,0.88464135,True
The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/24/the-guardian-view-on-un-climate-talks-they-reveal-how-little-time-is-left#comments,The Guardian view on UN climate talks: they reveal how little time is left | Editorial,"This year’s UN climate talks in Brazil’s Belém ended without a major breakthrough. The text of the final agreement lacked a deal to shift away from fossil fuels, delayed crucial finance and the “mutirão” decision contained no roadmap to halt and reverse deforestation. But the multilateral system at Cop30 held together at a point when its collapse felt close. This ought to be a warning: next year’s conference of the parties must strike a better bargain between the rich and poor world.

Developing countries are far from united on some issues. Over rare earth minerals China sees any move as targeting its dominance, while Africa sees it as essential for governance. Elsewhere petrostates did not support Colombia’s call for a fossil fuel phase-out. Yet the global south broadly coheres around a simple principle: its nations must be equipped to survive a climate emergency they did not create. That means cash to build flood defences, make agricultural systems resilient, protect coastlines and rebuild after disasters strike. They also demand front-loaded finance to transition to clean, green economic growth.

But climate finance is a hard sell in the global north. Rightwing populists in the west rail against cash being spent on climate and foreigners. Any issue that fuses the two becomes a difficult political terrain. Then there is the broader geopolitics – one in which spiky confrontations have become the norm. For parts of the rich world, clean industrialisation of the global south isn’t a priority – it’s an economic threat.

Donald Trump did not send a team to Brazil, the first time since 1995 America was not officially represented at the annual climate summit. This may not have been entirely unwelcome. The US, which owes the largest climate debt in the world, has blocked meaningful finance deals for years – and its reshoring agenda is designed to keep key industries at home. This is not entirely without logic: some analysts say China is the proof that the west has reason to fear too rapidly empowering poorer nations.

But such a narrow worldview will only hinder progress. As Evans Njewa, chair of the Least Developed Countries (LDC) group, stated bluntly after Cop30 ended, Belém was missing ambition. For him the world’s most vulnerable countries came seeking protection; they left with promises postponed. Yet the disappointment felt today is a spur for greater action tomorrow. The LDCs are looking to Cop31 in Turkey and, ultimately, to Cop32 in Ethiopia to change minds.

This year’s UN adaptation report could not be clearer: the scale of the task ahead is vast. Developing countries, it suggests, require more than $310bn per year by 2035 – yet they received only $26bn in 2023, down from $28bn the year before. Needs are rising faster than finance. The UN warns that without a dramatic course-correction the poorest countries will be left exposed to heatwaves, wildfires and floods.

The urgency of the crisis explains why African negotiators are so insistent that adaptation finance must be from the state, preferably in grant form. To imagine otherwise, they say, is delusional; currently private finance makes up only 5% of adaptation cash and most of that is philanthropic. Private capital will not build sea walls, restore mangroves or protect subsistence farmers. Cop30 underscored a simple reality: only by moving beyond symbolism and self-interest can the world secure its future.",2025-11-24 00:00:00,literal,Factual reporting on reporting and legal matters,literal,literal,0,literal,0.97540164,0.024598405,0.97540164,True

Now this is the kind of week that really takes a toll on the ol' reading backlog. No reader – no matter how foolhardy or flexibly employed – could hope to keep up with every new release worth reading this week.

John Irving's return to the world of The Cider House Rules headlines a publishing calendar so overstuffed with treasures, plenty of them don't even appear below. Those painful omissions include a pair of memoirs from celebrated storytellers and an investigation into big tech.

Hopefully, though, this list of six sterling options will still have some use for any overwhelmed readers looking for a more manageable foothold. Because I hate to say it: That mounting backlog of yours won't be any easier to scale next week.

Queen Esther, by John Irving

Four decades since the publication of The Cider House Rules, the venerable author has returned to the Maine orphanage where he set much of his popular novel and its film adaptation, which won him an Oscar. Back as well is Wilbur Larch, the curmudgeonly heartbeat of the first novel, but the spotlight is not with him. This time the star is the eponymous Esther Nacht, a Jewish orphan whose unconventional arc leads a story that's unmistakably Irving — amiably peopled, compellingly plotted and, above all, compassionate for its characters.

Only Son, by Kevin Moffett

Moffett's debut novel follows the arc of his narrator – an only son, natch – from the childhood loss of his father, through a complicated relationship with his mother, to an adulthood as the father of an only son himself. Of course, that plot summary does little justice to this slim suburban Buddha of a book, which is composed of a series of short vignettes that are so simple, subtle and occasionally destabilizing, they almost resemble zen koans — though no koan has ever, like Only Son, also had me tearing up or giggling enough to alarm passersby.

The Eleventh Hour: A Quintet of Stories, by Salman Rushdie

It's hard not to view every new book by Rushdie as a precious gift, after a stabbing attack in 2022 very nearly ended the celebrated septuagenarian's career — and his life. Now, just months after the sentencing of the man who tried to kill him, Rushdie's name again adorns a new book, this one a collection of unconnected short stories that straddle the Atlantic and brim with big ideas about identity, revenge and death.

Cursed Daughters, by Oyinkan Braithwaite

Braithwaite gets right to the point. The Nigerian novelist's darkly comic debut, My Sister, the Serial Killer, dealt with exactly that; and you can guess the premise of her sophomore effort, Cursed Daughters. The curse, a punishment for the matriarch's adultery, dooms the romantic relationships of her female descendants, including young Ebun. Or does it? You didn't expect things to stay straightforward, did you? ""This is a curse, this exists,"" she told NPR's Weekend Edition, but ""I was also approaching it from the perspective of generational trauma and what that looks like … and also this idea of a self-fulfilling prophecy.""

Palaver, by Bryan Washington

""Washington is an enormously gifted author,"" reviewer Michael Schaub wrote for NPR in 2020, ""and his writing — spare, unadorned, but beautiful — reads like the work of a writer who's been working for decades, not one who has yet to turn 30."" Five years on, the novelist — now a truly geriatric 32 years old — has only refined his keen eye for complicated family dynamics. In this National Book Award finalist, it's a complicated mother-son relationship that takes center stage, as the estranged pair find themselves suddenly in close proximity, grasping for understanding half a world away from home.

The Land in Winter, by Andrew Miller

For a pithy pitch for Miller's latest novel, I defer to the judges who put it on this year's Booker Prize shortlist. ""It's a joy to read, a nerve-shredding pleasure,"" they effused about the book, which follows a pair of expectant couples forced to hunker down during a historically bad winter in the early 1960s. The cold of the setting does little to dampen the lively wit of those forced to bear it. ""Every character is there, watching, acting, wilting,"" added the judges.

Before Sandra Grimes became a mole hunter, she'd been ready to scale back. ""I was not old enough at the time to retire,"" Grimes said in an interview for the National Security Archive at George Washington University, ""but I was satisfied professionally. I had a family that I wanted to spend more time with.""

It was 1991. Sandra Grimes had spent more than two decades with the CIA. But she agreed to stay on to help a colleague investigate why the agency's informants in the Soviet Union had ""gone dark,"" as they say in spycraft, in 1985 and 1986. They learned they had been identified, interrogated, and often executed.

""It was a terrible, terrible reminder of the seriousness of what we did for a living,"" Sandra Grimes said in that National Security Archive interview. ""We owed all these people who had made the sacrifice.""

Their investigation led them to look closely at Aldrich Ames, whom they knew as ""Rick."" He was the CIA's counterintelligence chief for Soviet operations, and knew about all of the agency's informants in the USSR.

Rick Ames had episodes of public drunkenness, carried on affairs, which triggered an expensive divorce, and married one of his old informants. He started wearing tailored suits, had his teeth capped, then paid cash for a new house and bought a Jaguar. All on a civil servant's salary.

Sandra Grimes scrutinized activity logs and financial statements and noticed that three times after Ames had lunch with a Soviet embassy official in Washington, D.C., he deposited thousands into his bank account.

""Well, three matches don't make a conviction, but in my mind, Rick was the spy,"" Sandra Grimes recollected. ""It didn't take a rocket scientist to add one plus one plus one.""

Aldrich Ames was arrested in 1994 and pled guilty to espionage, after taking millions of dollars for his spy work for the Soviet Union. He is still serving a life sentence.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/nov/04/donna-jean-godchaux-grateful-dead-tribute,Donna Jean Godchaux supplied steel and soul to the Grateful Dead in their prime,"By her own admission, Donna Jean Godchaux was not a fan of the Grateful Dead when she arrived in California – then Donna Jean Thatcher – in 1970. Already a music industry veteran at 23, she had spent five years as a member of Southern Comfort, a group of singers regularly employed as backing vocalists at the renowned Fame studios in her native Alabama. But she was rigidly unimpressed with her San Francisco friends’ undying devotion to Jerry Garcia and co. She hated the band’s name and loudly opined that the only reason people liked them was because they were invariably out of their minds on drugs when they went to see them live. In fact, she could prove she was right: she offered to attend a Dead show sober, certain she would hate it.

It proved a fateful decision. By the end of the Dead’s set at the Winterland Ballroom, Thatcher – ostensibly retired from music – had announced: “If I sing again, it will be with this band”. Through attending other Dead shows she met a local pianist named Keith Godchaux, whom she subsequently married, and after meeting Garcia and angling for him to give her new husband a job, she found herself hired as well.

On one occasion during the Europe ’72 tour, Godchaux took to the stage having taken 15 hits of LSD

It says something about the Grateful Dead’s unique position in American rock that Godchaux’s eight-year tenure with the band came to define her. It wasn’t as if her CV were lacking before she joined. Fame Studios was notoriously spotty when it came to crediting backing vocalists, so no complete record of her performances there exists, but she sang on Elvis Presley’s Suspicious Minds and In the Ghetto; Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman, and Warm and Tender Love; and with Aretha Franklin, Otis Redding and Dionne Warwick among others.

Her timing in joining the Dead was fortuitous: their sound had taken a turn for the rootsy with 1970’s Workingman’s Dead and American Beauty – two key texts in the development of what would come to be called Americana – but the band’s usual source of traditionally soulful vocals, the blues-influenced keyboard player Ron “Pigpen” McKernan, was ailing, stricken by the alcoholism that hastened his death in 1973. Steeped in a different musical tradition to the rest of the band, Godchaux’s voice swiftly became part of their sound, as evidenced by her contributions to guitarist Bob Weir’s solo debut Ace – a Dead album in all but name – and Europe ’72, the triple-vinyl live set that documented the band’s visit to the continent in the spring of that year, and a strong contender for the title of greatest Grateful Dead album of all.

But Godchaux’s apparently seamless integration into the band wasn’t quite as straightforward as it looked. She was a studio singer rather than a live vocalist, and the nightly high-wire act of the Grateful Dead’s live shows was quite the baptism by fire. Their three-hour-plus gigs were performed without a setlist, with members either calling for songs on stage in the style of jazz musicians at a jam session, or else by steering improvised passages towards the next track on the spot. In addition, it was a high-wire act that, in the early 70s at least, was often performed on acid. On one notable occasion during the Europe ’72 tour, Godchaux took to the stage having taken 15 hits of LSD, unaware that the band’s supply – which had been weakening in strength as the tour progressed – had been replenished with fresh, undiluted provisions. In her account, she spent most of the show lying prone under her husband’s piano, but somehow still made it to the microphone in time to sing.

Furthermore, while there were certainly some formidable women within the Dead’s inner circle – including Garcia’s partner Carolyn Adams, audio engineer and producer Betty Cantor-Jackson, and drummer Bill Kreutzmann’s wife Susila, who more or less singlehandedly started the band’s merchandising empire – its core was exclusively male and, as their biographer Dennis McNally tactfully put it, “not a bastion of feminist liberation”. But Godchaux, the only female member of the Grateful Dead during their 30-year history, was clearly made of stern stuff. She seldom took a lead vocal but demurred at the label “backing vocalist”, preferring the term “ensemble singing” – which certainly fits the sound of Godchaux and her band members belting out the choruses of Playing the Band or Eyes of the World en masse.

Still, she proved a controversial figure. The culture of fans obsessively taping Grateful Dead shows meant that mistakes as well as transcendent moments were captured for posterity, and the mistakes often involved re-creating complex vocal harmonies on stage. But it seemed hugely unfair that Godchaux’s voice was singled out for criticism given how pitchy the other members could sound. And Godchaux was often magnificent in concert, as the belatedly released live albums One from the Vault or The Closing of Winterland proved.

View image in fullscreen She never really left the band behind … Godchaux performing with Dead & Company in 2016. Photograph: Amy Harris/Shutterstock

In the studio, her voice was unimpeachable. Hear the depth her harmonies bring to Row Jimmy and Stella Blue, two impossibly beautiful ballads from 1973’s Wake of the Flood, the raw soulfulness of her voice on 1975’s The Music Never Stopped or her fantastic contributions to 1977’s slick Terrapin Station. And if you want to venture away from the Grateful Dead per se, her vocals on Palm Sunday and the brief Down Home from the Jerry Garcia Band’s 1978 album Cats Under the Stars are incredible.

Keith and Donna Godchaux both left the Grateful Dead after 1978’s patchy Shakedown Street, an album that sounded distinctly coked-out. The couple moved to Alabama to deal with Keith’s worsening drug problem, and he had apparently conquered his addictions when he was killed in a car crash in 1980.

Donna Jean married bass player David MacKay in 1981, becoming Donna Jean Thatcher Godchaux-Mackay, and formed a succession of other bands, but she never really left the Grateful Dead behind. She still performed their songs. Her version of Crazy Fingers is a highlight of the 2014 album she recorded with Jeff Matson, and Matson is a member of the Grateful Dead tribute band the Zen Tricksters, with whom Godchaux also recorded an album. She also happily sat in on stage with the Dark Star Orchestra, a band dedicated to recreating classic Dead shows live, became involved with the unending stream of archival Grateful Dead releases, and occasionally appeared on stage with various former band members.

Once a controversial addition, her role in the band seemed to be burnished by the passing of time. Deadheads can argue for hours about which of their lineups was the best, but the Godchaux-bolstered 70s version is always in strong contention. It was something that the band’s official statement about her death seemed to touch on: “Her contributions will forever remain part of the tapestry that continues to be woven.”",2025-11-04 00:00:00,metaphor,Rocks used as metaphor for causes disruption,metaphor,figurative,1,literal,0.747434,0.25256598,0.747434,False
Al Jazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/25/sudans-rsf-committing-war-crimes-in-darfur-says-amnesty,"Sudan’s RSF committing war crimes in Darfur, says Amnesty","The latest report came hours after the RSF agreed to a three-month humanitarian truce.

Sudan’s paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) fighters are committing war crimes in the Darfur town of el-Fasher, the rights group Amnesty International has alleged in a new report.

The report was published on Tuesday, just hours after the RSF declared that it would immediately enter into a three-month humanitarian truce “in response to international efforts” led by United States President Donald Trump.

Sudan plunged into chaos in April 2023 when a power struggle between the military and the RSF exploded into open fighting in the capital, Khartoum, and elsewhere in the country.

In its latest report, Amnesty said it had collected testimonies from 28 survivors describing atrocities in el-Fasher ranging from the summary execution of unarmed men to the rape of girls and women.

“This persistent, widespread violence against civilians constitutes war crimes and may also constitute other crimes under international law,” Amnesty chief Agnes Callamard said.

“All those responsible must be held accountable for their actions.”

The war in the Darfur region pits the regular forces of General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan against the RSF, headed by his former right-hand man and ally, Mohamed Daglo, since April 2023.

At the end of October, the RSF seized el-Fasher, the last major city in the vast western region of Darfur that had remained outside their control.

Last week, United Nations aid chief Tom Fletcher had said that el-Fasher has been transformed into a “crime scene” and said that those who commit these crimes must “face justice”.

Tuesday’s Amnesty report cites one survivor from el-Fasher who said she and her 14-year-old daughter were raped by RSF fighters as they fled the city.

Her daughter became very ill when they reached the refugee town of Tawila, and died in a clinic there, the woman told the rights group.

Another survivor who fled el-Fasher in late October said he witnessed people being shot by RSF forces while trying to flee.

“The RSF were killing people as if they were flies. It was a massacre. None of the people killed that I have seen were armed soldiers.”

Mediation has so far failed to end the fighting as both sides try to secure military gains before talks are held.

On Sunday, Burhan rejected a US truce proposal from the Quad group of mediators as the “worst yet” and unacceptable. The Quad group comprises the United States, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. Burhan claimed that the presence of the UAE – which he accused of supporting the RSF – in the Quad meant that the proposals could not be seen as unbiased.

The UAE has consistently denied any role in the war in Sudan, and on Monday, it accused Burhan of “consistently obstructive behaviour”.",2025-11-25 00:00:00,literal,Factual reporting on policy and political figures,literal,literal,0,literal,0.83876646,0.16123359,0.83876646,True

Such was the extent of fan involvement in the How I’m Feeling Now album that the title of Claws was decided by online vote. The opposite of the album’s more fraught depictions of lockdown, it celebrates being trapped with someone you love, although the clanking rhythm track adds a vague sense of unease.

19. Taxi (2016)

According to one fan database, there are 260 unreleased Charli xcx tracks lurking around online. Taxi, from the scrapped album XCX World, remains the most celebrated for a reason: the funny, snotty saga of a midweek blind date gone wildly out of control, it’s a perfect example of Charli and producer Sophie’s skewed approach to pop.

18. Apple (2024)

The poppiest track on Brat – nearly binned midway through recording sessions – Apple’s earworm bubblegum melody carries a lyric about strained parental relationships and intergenerational trauma. It also went on to both spawn a viral TikTok dance craze and earn a Grammy nomination. The remix, featuring the Japanese House, feels sweeter still – and equally fantastic.

17. New Shapes (ft Caroline Polachek and Christine and the Queens) (2021)

It’s easy to view Brat’s predecessor, Crash, as Charli xcx trying to fit in with standard ideas about mainstream pop, rather than forging her own distinctive path. But its highlights are pretty high: New Shapes deploys both Christine and the Queens and Caroline Polachek over a fierce take on 80s electro.

16. Roll With Me (2017)

View image in fullscreen Sophie (left) and Charli xcx on stage in 2016. Photograph: Daniel Boczarski/Redferns

There used to be a rule of thumb that Charli xcx perversely released her best tracks not on her albums but her mixtapes. Listening to Roll With Me, you can see how that idea blossomed: producer Sophie provides relentless kick-drum thwack and sparse, super-spiky electronics, while Charli brings fabulous attitude-laden pop smarts.

15. Nuclear Seasons (2011)

If you’re looking for early evidence that Charli xcx was different, then this track from her debut EP, later to become the opener for her debut album, is a good place to start. The lyrics mix up relationship trauma, post-apocalyptic imagery and the suggestion that pop culture is a state of decay; the music reboots doomy 80s synth pop. It’s also insanely catchy.

14. 360 (2024)

“I went my own way and I made it / I’m your favourite reference, baby … I don’t fucking care what you think”: 360 is both the sound of the Brat era swaggering (or perhaps staggering) into view and a superb pop song, whether you opt for the original or the Robyn and Yung Lean-assisted remix.

13. I Got It (2017)

The Pop 2 mixtape sounded like Charli xcx and her collaborators trying to will a more interesting, provocative pop landscape into being: on I Got It, extravagantly foul-mouthed rapper Cupcakke, Brazilian drag queen vocalist Pabllo Vittar and pansexual shape-shifting US singer Brooke Candy do their thing over a minimal, thrillingly futuristic musical backdrop.

12. House (2025)

However you might have expected Charli xcx to follow up Brat, it’s unlikely that you expected this, from the forthcoming soundtrack to Wuthering Heights: a warped electronic homage to the Velvet Underground, filled with drones, shards of noise and a guest appearance from John Cale, which bursts into furious distortion-laden industrial noise at its climax.

11. Club Classics (2024)

Pop has hardly wanted for songs about nightclubs, but few of them have captured the small hours dancefloor’s manic sense of euphoria like Club Classics. It feels chaotic, relentless and artificially accelerated, and celebrates complete abandon: “Sweat marks on all my clothes … I wanna be blinded by the lights.”

10. Gone (ft Christine and the Queens) (2019)

View image in fullscreen Christine and the Queens (left) and Charli xcx performing on The Tonight Show in 2019. Photograph: NBC/NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal/Getty Images

Another Christine and the Queens collaboration, Gone improbably transforms the lyrical topic of crushing social anxiety – “I feel so unstable / I fucking hate these people” – into anthemic pop. There’s a powerful sense of catharsis about the way it explodes from brooding verses into a banging, exhilarating chorus.

9. Backseat (ft Carly Rae Jepsen) (2017)

Charli xcx and Carly Rae Jepsen once drunkenly plotted to make an album together; their solitary IRL collaboration is marvellous. Thematically, Backseat feels like two different songs – one about a breakup, the other about the alienating nature of celebrity – perfectly joined by the chorus (“I’m alone”) and shifting, inventive electronic backing.

8. Boys (2017)

By latter-day xcx standards, Boys is musically and lyrically straightforward – a giddy reverie of lust set to a suitably daydreamy backing – but it’s utterly charming and joyful. Extra points for the video, which featured the lead singer of Vampire Weekend lurking among its parade of heavily muscled objects of desire.

7. Anthems (2020)

Written and recorded as Covid raged, its lyrics crowdsourced with fans online, Anthems perfectly captures those lockdown moments when the urge to, as Charli put it, “go out, blow off some steam, get fucked up” became overwhelming. If its sound is intense to the point of seeming a bit nuts, well, that’s how it felt.

6. Boom Clap (2014)

Originally intended for former Disney star Hilary Duff (she rejected it), the song’s author turned Boom Clap into the highlight of her second album, Sucker, and her first US Top 10 hit. No wonder: it’s hugely catchy and impressively classy, the hooky chorus set amid chugging, pulsing synths – though she hates it now.

5. Next Level Charli (2019)

A paean to her fans, packed with references to her past work, the brilliance of Next Level Charli lies in the gulf between the music, which lulls the listener into believing they’re going to get a dreamy, 80s-influenced ballad, and the gobby, playground-chant stridency of the vocal: “In the rave – go for ever and ever!”

You could call Von Dutch a diss track – it’s rumoured to be aimed at FKA twigs – but it feels more like an infectious expression of self-confidence: someone who knows she has hit her imperial phase, and has created an irresistible, epochal pop single almost entirely out of grinding, revving noise to prove it.

3. Vroom Vroom (2015)

A step into the leftfield that got decidedly mixed reviews on release, Vroom Vroom now feels like the birth of Charli xcx 2.0, harnessing her songwriting skills to the skeletal, avant-pop sound of PC Music affiliate Sophie. A decade ago it felt completely removed from mainstream pop trends; today it sounds incredibly prescient.

2. Girl, So Confusing (2024)

A different class to the usual pop-star-writes-prickly-song-about-fellow-pop-star fare, Girl, So Confusing is both an amazing song and a heartwarming saga. The original version depicted a fraught relationship with Lorde, accompanied by a synthesiser that fizzes and growls; the remix featured Lorde herself answering the criticisms and movingly explaining her own issues.

1. Track 10 (2017)

On the face of it, Track 10, from her mixtape Pop 2, is an unlikely list-topper. It’s a remix of a demo – eventually reworked into the Lizzo-featuring 2019 single Blame It on Your Love – with what looks like a placeholder title. But it’s also a masterpiece: an epic ballad that’s both wildly experimental and genuinely affecting. The lyrics sound like a drunken confession from someone who can’t stop her insecurities destroying a relationship. Anyone else might have been inclined to play a song like that straight, but somehow, the overload of theoretically alienating electronics – glitches and distortion, wilfully excessive AutoTune, icy maximalist rave synths – only amplifies its impact.",2025-11-20 00:00:00,metaphor,Explodes used as metaphor for sudden intensification,metaphor,figurative,1,literal,0.9329234,0.0670767,0.9329234,False
NBC News Think,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-visit-china-april-host-xi-jinping-later-year-rcna245740,Trump says he will visit China in April and host Xi Jinping later next year,"President Donald Trump said Monday that he will travel to Beijing in April and host Chinese President Xi Jinping for a state visit later in the year.

Trump announced the plans after a call with Xi on Monday, which came weeks after a meeting in South Korea at the end of October.

""Our relationship with China is extremely strong!"" Trump wrote on Truth Social. ""Now we can set our sights on the big picture. To that end, President Xi invited me to visit Beijing in April, which I accepted, and I reciprocated where he will be my guest for a State Visit in the U.S. later in the year.""

The travel plans come after the Trump administration detailed a trade deal framework with China that renewed soybean purchases from China and loosened China’s export restrictions on rare earth minerals, two commitments that are pending full compliance from China.

The call focused on the Russia-Ukraine war, fentanyl and agricultural products like soybeans, a major U.S. export, Trump said.

Trump spoke with Xi for about an hour Monday, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, who said that “it was a very positive call” that largely focused on a trade deal the United States is working out with China “and those relations and how they are moving in a positive direction.”

Chinese state media said the call centered on Taiwan, which Trump said was not discussed last month at their most recent in-person meeting. Xi told Trump on Monday's call that “Taiwan’s return to China is an integral part of the post-war international order,” according to Chinese state media.

While he was in South Korea visiting with Xi in October, Trump said that he would head to China in April and that Xi would make a trip “some time after that,” to either Florida or Washington, D.C.",2025-11-24 23:07:59.635000+00:00,literal,Factual reporting on reporting and political figures,literal,literal,0,literal,0.81791306,0.18208693,0.81791306,True
Al Jazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/16/on-world-food-day-israel-continues-to-restrict-aid-into-gaza,"On World Food Day, Israel continues to restrict aid into Gaza","Two million people continue to face hunger and thirst, while more than 460 Palestinians have died from starvation.

Despite a ceasefire deal with Israel, Palestinians across the devastated Gaza Strip continue to go hungry as food supplies remain critically low and aid fails to reach those who need it most.

As per the ceasefire agreement, Israel was supposed to allow 600 humanitarian aid trucks into Gaza per day. However, Israel has since reduced the limit to 300 trucks per day, citing delays in retrieving bodies of Israeli captives buried under the rubble by Israeli attacks.

According to the UN2720 Monitoring and Tracking Dashboard, which monitors humanitarian aid being offloaded, collected, delivered and intercepted on its way into Gaza, from October 10-16, only 216 trucks have reached their intended destinations inside Gaza.

According to truck drivers, aid deliveries are facing significant delays, with Israeli inspections taking much longer than expected.

Satellite images captured by Planet Labs on October 14 and 15 show a large number of trucks queuing on the Egyptian side of the Rafah crossing and heading towards the Kerem Abu Salem crossing.

‘Palestinians want food’

While some food aid has trickled in over the past few days, medical equipment, therapeutic nutrition and medicines are still in extremely short supply, despite being desperately needed by the most impoverished, particularly malnourished children.

Reporting from Deir el-Balah, in central Gaza, Al Jazeera’s Hind Khoudary said some commercial trucks have entered Gaza over the past few days, but most Palestinians do not have the ability to buy any of the items they are bringing in as they have spent all of their savings in the past two years.

So far, what has arrived in the trucks includes “wheat, rice, sugar, oil, fuel and cooking gas”, she said.

While food distribution points are expected to open for parcels and other humanitarian aid, people in Gaza have yet to receive them. “Palestinians want food, they want shelter, they want medicine,” Khoudary said.

She added that even 600 trucks a day would be insufficient to meet the needs of Gaza’s entire population.

Food ‘is not a bargaining chip’

The UN humanitarian chief, Tom Fletcher, has urged Israel to open more border crossings for humanitarian aid.

“We need more crossings open and a genuine, practical, problem-solving approach to removing remaining obstacles. Throughout this crisis, we have insisted that withholding aid from civilians is not a bargaining chip. Facilitation of aid is a legal obligation,” Fletcher said.

Since the ceasefire began, 137 World Food Programme trucks have entered Gaza as of October 14, delivering supplies to bakeries and supporting nutrition and food distribution programmes.

With the ceasefire in effect, WFP is now scaling up. 🔹137 trucks have already entered #Gaza — supporting bakeries, nutrition, and food distributions. 🔹170,000+ MT of food ready to move, enough to feed 2M people.

Israeli authorities continue to block UNRWA

The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) – the primary and largest organisation providing aid to Palestinians – has faced significant restrictions imposed by Israel.

The agency, which was responsible for delivering food, medical care, education and emergency assistance, says it has enough food aid in warehouses in Jordan and Egypt to supply the people in Gaza for three months.

This includes food parcels for 1.1 million people and flour for 2.1 million, and shelter supplies sufficient for up to 1.3 million individuals.

However, despite the ceasefire, Israeli authorities are continuing to block them from entering.

UNRWA has enough food outside #Gaza to supply people there for three months, amid desperate need. Our teams stand ready to deliver it. But despite the #ceasefire, the Israeli Authorities’ block on UNRWA bringing any supplies into Gaza still continues after over 7 months.

Malnutrition among children

As of October 12, at least 463 people, including 157 children, have died from starvation amid Israel’s blockade of the Gaza Strip. Nearly one in four children suffers from severe acute malnutrition.

After prolonged starvation, food must be reintroduced carefully under medical supervision to avoid re-feeding syndrome, a potentially fatal condition in which sudden intake of nutrients causes dangerous shifts in electrolytes, affecting the heart, nerves and muscles. A larger supply of nutritional aid, given safely, could dramatically save lives.

According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), 90 percent of children in Gaza less than two years of age consume fewer than two food groups each day, which doesn’t include protein-rich foods.

At least 290,000 children between the ages of six months and 5 years, and 150,000 pregnant and breastfeeding women require feeding and micronutrient supplies.

In addition to this, there are an estimated 132,000 cases of children less than the age of five, and 55,000 pregnant and breastfeeding women projected to be suffering from acute malnutrition by June 2026, if immediate food aid isn’t made available.",2025-10-16 00:00:00,literal,Factual reporting on reporting and legal matters,literal,literal,0,literal,0.9427877,0.057212282,0.9427877,True
NBC News Think,https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/trump-signs-executive-order-launching-genesis-mission-ai-project-rcna245600,Trump signs executive order launching AI initiative being compared to the Manhattan Project,"President Donald Trump signed an executive order Monday afternoon launching a new federal effort to supercharge American artificial intelligence research, development and scientific applications.

Unveiling the new “Genesis Mission” to support American efforts on AI, the order charts out a series of steps to expand computational resources, increase access to vast federal datasets and move toward impactful, real-world applications, particularly in scientific fields.

“The Genesis Mission will dramatically accelerate scientific discovery, strengthen national security, secure energy dominance, enhance workforce productivity, and multiply the return on taxpayer investment into research and development,” the order states.

Michael Kratsios, assistant to the president for science and technology and director of the Office for Science and Technology Policy, will lead the effort.

Monday's order describes the Genesis Mission as ""comparable in urgency and ambition to the Manhattan Project.""

Among other measures, the order charges Secretary of Energy Chris Wright with establishing a new “American Science and Security Platform” to centralize the infrastructure required for the new push. According to the order, the platform will focus on providing researchers with the computing power and datasets necessary to train AI models.

“The Genesis Mission will build an integrated AI platform to harness Federal scientific datasets — the world’s largest collection of such datasets, developed over decades of Federal investments — to train scientific foundation models and create AI agents to test new hypotheses, automate research workflows, and accelerate scientific breakthroughs,” the order reads.

The order opens the door to significantly increased public-private partnerships on AI development: within 90 days, the secretary of energy must identify systems and data available to support the program, including “resources available through industry partners.”

AI systems require immense datasets in order to learn how to represent the real world. With its vast troves of information about Americans and their activities, the federal government has an enviable, but often decentralized and disorganized, gold mine of data untapped by AI companies to date.

Monday’s order targets these barriers to data-sharing, giving Kratsios the responsibility to integrate “appropriate and available agency data and infrastructure into the Mission.”

With increased computing resources and access to data, AI should then be applied to practical and critical scientific issues within 270 days, the order states. These areas of “science and technology challenges of national importance” include advanced manufacturing and robotics, biotechnology and nuclear fission and fusion.

Keegan McBride, a senior policy advisor at the Tony Blair Institute and an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, said the announcement was significant.

“AI has the potential to transform the entire scientific, research, and discovery pipeline. This represents a strong signal from the U.S. to the world about what is possible,” McBride told NBC News.

Monday’s announcement builds on the existing National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource (NAIRR). The NAIRR was created in 2020 by the National Artificial Intelligence Initiative Act of 2020 to provide a shared, robust national research infrastructure to “accelerate AI and AI-powered discovery and innovation.”

The NAIRR started as a pilot program, bringing together a coalition of federal agencies, ranging from the Department of Defense and NASA to the National Institutes of Health, and nongovernmental organizations like OpenAI, Google and Palantir, to set up a nationwide research community.

Lynne Parker, who co-chaired the NAIRR task force as deputy chief technology officer of the U.S. under President Joe Biden and is now associate vice chancellor emerita at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, said federal support for AI research is pivotal to future progress.

“Government support for AI research builds the foundation for new breakthroughs and helps keep innovation aligned with the public interest,” Parker told NBC News. “We take for granted that new products appear regularly but seldom consider the decades of research that made them possible.”

“Without long-term investment, we risk ceding leadership in the technologies that will define our economy, our security, and our daily lives,” she said.

The Trump administration’s AI Action Plan, released in July, emphasized the role of national research and development efforts, partially stemming from the NAIRR, “to foster the next generation of AI breakthroughs.”

Monday’s executive order came weeks after the federal government announced new partnerships with some of America’s leading AI companies to build the next generation of AI-focused supercomputers.

At the end of October, the U.S. Department of Energy announced a new partnership with AMD to launch two new supercomputers at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, home to some of America’s leading federal AI researchers.

“Winning the AI race requires new and creative partnerships that will bring together the brightest minds and industries American technology and science has to offer,” Secretary Wright said at the time in a statement.

“Working with AMD and HPE, we’re bringing new capacity online faster than ever before, turning shared innovation into national strength, and proving that America leads when private-public partners build together,” Wright said, referencing Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s role in building the supercomputers.

At the beginning of November, the Department of Energy announced further plans to expand Oak Ridge’s Leadership Computer Facility with high-powered Nvidia chips to tackle complex quantum-computing and AI-focused research.",2025-11-25 03:22:41.063000+00:00,literal,Factual reporting on reporting and data,literal,literal,0,literal,0.80556005,0.19443996,0.80556005,True

There's a moment in the new movie, Wicked: For Good, when Elphaba, the so-called Wicked Witch, stops defending herself to a world that has misunderstood her and embraces her own power. Cynthia Erivo, who plays Elphaba, sees a connection between her character's trajectory and her own.

""There were so many sort of real parallels — the relationship with her father, the relationship to being in spaces that don't really include you,"" Erivo says. ""The feelings you see in the movie are very real feelings.""

Erivo grew up in London as the child of Nigerian immigrants. From an early age, it was evident that she had a powerful singing voice. She attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, but felt like an outsider.

""It was a tough experience to be there. I just didn't think I fit,"" she says. ""And I think there was sort of a lack of wanting to understand where I was coming from or who I was as a person.""

Erivo first broke through on Broadway in The Color Purple, winning a Tony Award for her portrayal of Celie. She went on to earn an Oscar nomination for her portrayal of Harriet Tubman, and later played Aretha Franklin in Genius Aretha.

In Wicked: For Good, Erivo reprises her role as Elphaba, alongside Ariana Grande as Glinda, in this final chapter of the Wicked story. Both Wicked movies were filmed at the same time, which proved challenging at times.

""There were days where, luckily, you would sort of know where the character was at this point [in the story],"" Erivo says. ""But there were some times where you're sort of guessing really, because you hadn't shot a certain scene, you're just sort of assuming that the scene is gonna feel this way.""

Erivo also has a new memoir, Simply More: A Book for Anyone who Has Been Told They're Too Much, which details her childhood in South London and her path to the stage.

Interview highlights

On her physical training for Wicked

I'd [swim] laps, then sing and then I'd run. ... It's the idea that if I'm doing something that's strenuous and I can sing it whilst I'm doing the thing that's strenuous, when I'm standing still, it'll just be there. I won't actually have to work that hard for it to be there. ... Once your body has it in it, it just sort of lives with you. And so that's what I wanted for myself.

On getting into character through perfume

I started doing this years and years ago. The first time I did it, I think I did with Harriet [Tubman] and hers was, like, cedarwood and lavender, I think it was, but like essence with a base oil, not a perfume, because I wanted it to feel like something she could find, that she could discover, make, as opposed to something you could just buy in a store and spray on oneself. Because of the time, because of who she was, I wanted it to feel like it was of the Earth. And then I realized how powerful it was for me. And so I kept doing it with my characters. ...

So Elphaba, who's younger, I sort of messed around with big florals, like really deep florals. So tuberose, rose, lilies and then I mixed it with a tobacco oud. It was a scent called Witchy Woo. When I found it, I thought, there's no way this is going to work. It will be way too on the nose. … I was staying at a Soho Farmhouse in the UK and they have this little sort of gift shop and in the back they have a few perfumes … I sprayed some on my hand and immediately I wasn't convinced, but you know how perfume changes? … My body is like, no, this is a really good scent. There was a reason it was there for you, go back for it.

On her decision to cut, and then shave, her hair

I want them to just see my face. I want, when I walk in, for them to see a canvas that can transform.

It started a long time ago, just as I was coming out of drama school. I just knew that I wanted something different. Around that time, everyone who was auditioning, girls who were auditioning wanted long hair and a particular kind of aesthetic, and I sort of repelled against the idea because I didn't want any distractions. I don't know what gave me the idea, what gave [me] the wherewithal to think, I want to lessen the distraction. I want them to just see my face. I want, when I walk in, for them to see a canvas that can transform. A vessel. That what you see is really me, and I can change into the character in front of your very eyes.

After I left drama school, I cut my hair. I went to get a haircut and the hairdresser was very, very scared to cut it, because my hair was quite long. It came down past my shoulders. … If you're African, often you cut your hair if you lose someone. So there's an understanding of loss. You know that the old adage when a woman cuts her hair or changes her hairstyle, a life shift has happened. That is very true of the Nigerian tradition. And so, for me, I felt like I went for my own life shift. ... It was sort of leaving [drama school] behind and taking from it what I needed and letting go of whatever else I didn't. And when I cut my hair, I felt strangely like myself. I've felt like I've been steadily moving towards cutting it off completely, and Wicked was the moment when I took it off completely.

It's one of those moments that I've started to learn to forgive myself for because ... previously I've felt so mad at myself. So I guess there's a part of me that's a little bit ashamed that I would sort of give up my voice in that way. But it's also why I'm vehemently protective of the way I use my voice. I do not say yes to everything at all. It has to mean something for me to sing, and it has to make sense. I will never give my voice to someone like that again, because it felt like someone removing a gift that was meant for me and giving it to someone else. It just felt, in the moment, really awful, and I remember feeling really wrong. It felt wrong.

On not growing up with her father, and not having a relationship with him as an adult

Macmillan

I think I'm in a real place of acceptance, and a strange apathy as well. I don't wish him harm, but it's not like I'm waiting for some grand resolution. I'm sort of OK with it being exactly what it is. I have no desire to start a relationship. I have no desire to mend a relationship. But it doesn't really occupy my thoughts.

If the point of doing the things you love or the point of doing a thing that you're good at is to make someone care about you, is to prove that you are meant to be loved, is to prove that you are worthy of being loved, it doesn't sustain. Because really and truly, the most important love is that of yourself. It has to come from you first.

NBC News Think,https://www.nbcnews.com/sports/nfl/raiders-part-ways-with-offensive-coordinator-chip-kelly-ncna1417088,Raiders part ways with offensive coordinator Chip Kelly,"Chip Kelly’s time in the NFL has ended. Again.

The Raiders announced that they have parted ways with their first-year offensive coordinator.

“I spoke with Chip Kelly earlier this evening and informed him of his release as offensive coordinator of the Raiders,” coach Pete Carroll said a press release. “I would like to thank Chip for his service and wish him all the best in the future.”

Kelly, hired as part of Pete Carroll’s staff after spending 2024 with Ohio State, was the highest-paid coordinator in the NFL, reportedly at $6 million per year.

An interim coordinator has not yet been identified.

Kelly went from a successful run as head coach at Oregon to the Eagles in 2013. He was fired after three seasons, and he was one-and-done as head coach of the 49ers.

From 2018 through 2023 he was the head coach at UCLA. His job with the Raiders was his first NFL stint as a coordinator.

It had seemed for weeks as if Carroll and Kelly could not co-exist over the long term. As it turned out, they couldn’t co-exist in the short term.

Whatever the Raiders do next, it likely won’t change their eventual fate for the season. They’re currently 2-9. And the overriding question is whether Carroll, who has lost five games in a row for only the second time in his 28-year career as a pro and college coach, will be back in 2026.",2025-11-24 03:57:28.289000,literal,Straightforward news about reporting,literal,literal,0,literal,0.9798971,0.020102862,0.9798971,True

Hurricane Melissa, which has been barrelling towards Jamaica, is expected to be the most powerful hurricane to ever make a direct hit on the island.

The hurricane intensified on Monday into a Category 5 storm, the most powerful on the Saffir-Simpson scale, with wind speeds exceeding 300km/h (186mph).

By Monday night, Melissa had begun lashing Jamaica. Seven deaths have been reported so far – three in Jamaica, three in Haiti and one in the Dominican Republic.

The storm was expected to make landfall in Jamaica on Tuesday morning, according to the National Hurricane Center (NHC) in the United States. It said Melissa would cause “destructive winds” and “catastrophic flooding”, which it forecast would worsen throughout the day and night.

Jamaica’s Meteorological Service added: “Life-threatening storm surge, accompanied by large and destructive waves, is likely along the south coast of Jamaica late Monday through Tuesday morning.”

How did Hurricane Melissa form?

Melissa originated as a cluster of thunderstorms off the coast of West Africa. It travelled west and evolved into a depression. On October 21, it reached tropical storm status.

Over the weekend, Melissa became a Category 4 storm as it made its way west through the Caribbean Sea.

Melissa is the 13th hurricane of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to November 30. On average, the Atlantic basin experiences about seven hurricanes and three major hurricanes each year. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the US predicted an above-normal Atlantic hurricane season this year with 13 to 18 named storms.

This is the third Category 5 hurricane of the season after Hurricanes Erin and Humberto.

Authorities use the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale to classify storms. The scale divides hurricanes into five categories based on their sustained wind speeds.

The highest is Category 5, which means a storm that has a sustained wind speed of 252km/h (157mph) or higher. Category 5 storms usually bring “catastrophic damage”, according to the NHC.

How has Melissa progressed? When and where will it hit Jamaica?

In anticipation of the hurricane, residents in Jamaica have been told to protect their homes with sandbags and boards, and to stock up on essentials.

The NHC said hurricane-force winds will extend up to 45km (30 miles) from Melissa’s centre and tropical storm-force winds will extend up to 315km (195 miles) from it.

By 4am local time (09:00 GMT) on Tuesday, Hurricane Melissa was still “slowly” moving towards Jamaica with anticipated landfall later in the morning.

On Tuesday morning, Melissa’s centre was located about 180km (115 miles) southwest of the island, the hurricane was edging closer to Jamaica at a speed of about 8 kilometres per hour (5 miles per hour) as it made a northeast turn.

The turn – which is expected to bring the hurricane’s eyewall first to Jamaica’s southern coast – will be accompanied by “an increase in forward speed”, the NHC said, “followed by a faster northeastward motion” on Wednesday and Thursday.

Melissa is projected to be Jamaica’s worst storm in the century, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) warned on Tuesday.

“It’s a catastrophic situation expected in Jamaica,” Anne-Claire Fontan, a tropical cyclone specialist at the WMO said during a press briefing in Geneva. “For Jamaica, it will be the storm of the century for sure.”

Here is how the storm is expected to progress:

Monday, 7am in Jamaica (12:00 GMT)

On Monday morning, Melissa was upgraded to a Category 5 hurricane as it moved northwest in the Caribbean.

Tuesday, 1am (06:00 GMT)

Melissa will likely make landfall soon after this time. The NHC said because the storm is moving slowly – at 8km/h (5mph) – it will cause more damage.

“This extreme rainfall potential, owing to the slow motion, is going to create a catastrophic event here for Jamaica,” NHC Deputy Director Jamie Rhome said.

Melissa is expected to bring rainfall of 381mm to 762mm (15 to 30 inches) to portions of Jamaica and additional rainfall of 203mm to 406mm (8 to 16 inches) for southern Hispaniola through Wednesday with rainfall totals of 1,016mm (40 inches) possible. Catastrophic flash flooding and numerous landslides are likely.

Wednesday, 1pm (18:00 GMT)

Melissa is forecast to pass over Cuba by Wednesday before moving through the Greater Antilles and out into the Atlantic.

It is predicted to weaken to Category 3 by the time it reaches Cuba.

What is the latest on the ground?

Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness said: “I know that there are many Jamaicans who are anxious, who are very concerned, and rightfully so. You should be concerned.

“But the best way to address anxiety and any nervousness and concern is to be prepared.”

He added that “there is no infrastructure in the region” that can withstand a storm of Melissa’s strength.

Jamaica’s Meteorological Service has advised small craft operators and fishermen on the cays and banks to remain in safe harbour until wind and sea conditions return to normal

“Leaving the island before the hurricane arrives is not an option,” it said. The main airports – Kingston and Montego Bay – are closed. Kingston’s airport is warning: “Passengers, contact your airline for rebooking. DO NOT go to the airport.”

Warnings have also been put in place for parts of Haiti, the Dominican Republic and eastern Cuba, where Melissa is expected to cause similar damage.

Jamaica’s history of hurricanes

According to the NHC, Jamaica has experienced only one Category 4 storm, Hurricane Gilbert in 1988. It was the most destructive storm in Jamaica’s history and killed at least 45 people.

In October 2012, Hurricane Sandy was the first to make landfall on the island since Gilbert. It hit as a Category 1 storm.

Al Jazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/11/13/asean-cant-let-trumps-america-set-the-pace-on-climate-action,ASEAN can’t let Trump’s America set the pace on climate action,"With the United States retreating under President Trump, Southeast Asia and the Global South must show what real climate leadership looks like.

America’s renewed scepticism, and even hostility under Donald Trump’s second administration, does not for one moment alter the fact that climate change is real.

Neither does it negate the reality that the Global South — including the almost 700 million-strong Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), virtually all of which are tropical countries — is on the front line of the climate crisis.

Typhoons Tino and Uwan, which recently struck our region, especially the Philippines, are the latest proof of this and a reminder of the urgent need for climate justice.

What the Global South needs from summits like COP30 has been stated time and time again. It really boils down to four things.

The developed world needs to listen

On the one hand, developed countries need to listen to developing and less developed countries on how climate change should be addressed.

A rigid approach to the various facets of climate action, including technology, energy transition and biodiversity conservation, will ultimately frustrate the sincere, proactive measures that many Global South countries, including Malaysia and several of its ASEAN partners, are taking towards these goals.

More flexibility on the part of the Global North would go a long way towards ensuring that the war against climate change is won.

This is not an attempt to water down or deflect anything. The right to live in a sustainable environment is arguably a fundamental human right.

Israel’s devastating war in Gaza has also resulted in widespread ecocide that Western nations have remained strangely silent on, but whose ramifications — not only for the Middle East but for the wider world — will last for decades.

There should therefore be no doubt that sustainability and human rights go together. Supporting the former, especially in ASEAN and the Global South, is a means of upholding the latter.

Developed countries should bring their chequebooks

At the risk of putting things crudely, money talks. The various climate finance commitments — especially those for vulnerable nations — must not only be fulfilled, but also increased.

Projections from the United Nations Global Policy Model estimate that developing countries will need around $1.1 trillion in climate finance by 2025 and some $1.8 trillion by 2030.

The chair of the COP30 UN Climate Change Conference, Brazil, has rightly said that it hopes the meeting in Belem will be remembered as “the COP of Adaptation Implementation”. This is astute because, while I do not share the view that it is too late to act, it should be painfully clear that climate action can no longer be about setting lofty goals. Rather, the time has come to deliver.

The Global South can lead on climate change

Admittedly, the absence of the United States — as the world’s superpower and largest economy — looms over the COP and any international efforts to protect the environment. But the absence of the US is not a reason to retreat from climate action, or any other international cause; rather, it is an opportunity to reaffirm and strengthen multilateral cooperation.

Although it would be nice to have the US involved, the world can act without America. As has been widely reported, China’s carbon dioxide emissions have either flatlined or fallen over the past 18 months.

Moreover, the Tropical Forest Forever Facility (TFFF), proposed by Brazil’s President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, is an important part of the solution.

With the World Bank as its trustee and interim host, the TFFF seeks to support lasting conservation strategies and protect crucial tropical ecosystems through global, public and private partnerships.

With a medium-term goal of achieving a $125bn fund, the TFFF Launch Declaration has been endorsed by 53 countries and 19 sovereign wealth funds. Among them are 34 tropical forest countries, covering 90 percent of the tropical forests in developing nations.

It has been reported that Norway, Brazil, Indonesia, Portugal, France and the Netherlands have already made financial commitments. So far, $5.5bn has been announced — an encouraging, albeit modest, start to what will be a long journey.

Nevertheless, the TFFF shows that the Global South has the potential to build initiatives of its own, including on existential global challenges such as climate change.

Again, this is something the Global North must support. It arguably owes a “debt” to tropical countries for the huge carbon sinks they provide.

This must be achieved not through prescriptive policies, but through equitable, transparent climate reparations to ensure that the burden of conserving irreplaceable biodiversity does not come at the cost of education, jobs or dignity for the people of these countries.

ASEAN must do its part

The tropical countries — including those in ASEAN — cannot shirk their responsibilities, either.

It was disappointing that climate change did not feature more prominently during the recent 47th ASEAN Summit in Kuala Lumpur, which was chaired by Malaysia’s Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, despite the 2025 chairmanship’s theme of “Inclusivity and Sustainability.”

To be fair, the Chair’s Statement commendably noted that the regional bloc had “adopted the ASEAN Joint Statement on Climate Change” at COP30 and “welcomed the ASEAN Pavilion”, as well as “looked forward to the development of the ASEAN Climate Change Strategic Action Plan (ACCSAP) to further advance climate action in the region”.

The ASEAN Declaration on the Right to a Safe, Clean, Healthy and Sustainable Environment was also adopted during the summit in Kuala Lumpur, following several years of diplomacy among member states.

We must also not forget that the ASEAN Summit saw the historic accession of Timor-Leste to our ranks and progress on the ASEAN Power Grid.

These are all commendable achievements, but they still fall short of the proactive posture the developing world often urges the developed world to take. We must do as much — if not more — than we expect of others.

Some may argue that ASEAN lacks the financial capacity to act alone. But 2025 summits have shown that it has the credibility and influence to connect disparate blocs — including China, the BRICS coalition of economies, the Gulf Cooperation Council, the European Union, Africa and Latin America.

How far does the ASEAN Joint Statement on Climate Change go in recognising that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) lists Southeast Asian countries among those that will be hardest hit by climate change?

Without action, words remain just words. This leaves ASEAN — which has a proud record of neutrality — vulnerable to accusations of pandering to Trump (who, as we know, was briefly present at the summit) even in the face of climate-related disasters affecting our people.

What ASEAN — and indeed the rest of the Global South — needs is bold, decisive multilateral action in partnership with like-minded regions.

The urgency that ASEAN demonstrates in defending its geopolitical agency and advancing economic integration must now manifest in stronger, more vocal climate leadership.

More can and should be done. It is still not too late for both the developed and developing worlds to win the fight against climate change.

Nutrition policy expert Marion Nestle says that when she wrote her first book, Food Politics, in 2002, people often asked her what food had to do with politics.

""Nobody asks me that anymore,"" Nestle says. ""When I look at what's happening with food assistance I'm just stunned.""

Nestle says the Trump administration's efforts to withhold SNAP benefits from millions of Americans has made clear how fragile our economy is: ""We have 42 million people in this country — 16 million of them children — who can't rely on a consistent source of food from day to day and have to depend on a government program that provides them with benefits that really don't cover their food needs, only cover part of their food needs.""

Decades of studying the food industry have given Nestle a clear-eyed view of why food has become difficult to afford — including the ways supermarkets contribute to the problem. ""The purpose of a supermarket is to sell as much food as possible to as many people as possible, as often as possible at as higher prices they can get away with,"" she says.

Nestle's 2006 book, What to Eat, became a consumer bible of sorts when it came out, guiding readers through the supermarket while exposing how industry marketing and policy steer our food choices. Now, two decades later, she's back with What to Eat Now, a revised field guide for the supermarket of 2025.

Nestle recommends what she called a ""triple duty"" diet aimed at preventing hunger, obesity and climate change: ""Eat real food, processed as little as possible, with a big emphasis on plants,"" she says.

On how supermarkets are in the business of selling products, not providing nutrition

The more products you see, the more you're likely to buy. Therefore, the products that are organized so that you cannot miss them are in prime supermarket real estate. And companies pay the supermarkets to place their products at eye level, at the ends of aisles — those have a special name, end caps — and at the cash register. When you see products at the catch register, they're paying fees to the supermarket by the inch of space. And that's how supermarkets make a lot of their money, is through slotting fees. And, of course, what this does is it keeps small producers out, because they can't afford to make those kinds of payments. ... I mean, we're talking about thousands, or in some cases, hundreds of thousands of dollars. And every single product that is in a supermarket is placed where it is for a reason.

On how dollar stores got into the food business

They started out by selling the most popular ultra-processed foods. ... They're going to have chips. They're going to have sugar-sweetened cereals. They're going to have every junk food you could possibly think of. That's what they make their money off of. They will have a few fruits and vegetables, a few sad bananas, a few sad apples, maybe some pears, maybe some green vegetables, but not very many, and they'll be in a case off somewhere because they have to offer those. Because they're taking SNAP benefits, they're required to meet the stocking requirements of the SNAP program, which requires them to have a certain number of fruits and vegetables. … And [dollar stores are] just everywhere. And during the pandemic, particularly, they just proliferated like mad, and they undercut local stores. They're cheaper. They have poorer quality food, but the prices are lower. Price is an enormous issue.

If you want a Trader Joe's or a Whole Foods or a Wegmans in your neighborhood, you've got to have hundreds of thousands of people within walking distance or quick driving distance who make very, very good incomes or the [people] aren't gonna go there. They're going to close the stores that are not performing well, meaning having lots and lots of people spending lots and lots of money at them. And so as the big grocery stores have closed in inner city neighborhoods, the dollar stores moved in.

On food waste in America

Our food system in the United States produces 4,000 calories a day for every man, woman and little tiny baby in the country. That's roughly twice what the population needs on average. So waste is built into the system. Because that's how the subsidies work. The agricultural subsidies encourage food producers to produce as much food as possible because they get paid for the amount of food that they produce.

On initially agreeing with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s ""Make America Healthy Again"" approach to the food industry

I was very hopeful when he was appointed, because he was talking about, let's get the toxins out of the food supply. Let's make America healthy again. Let's make America's kids healthy again. Let's do something about ultra-processed foods. Let's do something about mercury and fish. And a lot of other issues that I thought, ""Oh, how absolutely terrific that we're going to have somebody who cares about the same kind of issues I do. This is very exciting.""

When President Trump introduced his nomination of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on social media, President Trump talked about the food industrial complex. I nearly fell off my chair! I thought, ""Here's the president sounding just like me. What's going on here?"" So then we had the first MAHA report, the first Make America Healthy Again report, which talked about a lot of these issues and put in an aspirational agenda. ""We're going to work on this, this and this"" — all of that sounded terrific. And then the second report came out and they had backed off on nearly all of the things that I thought were really critically important.

On why she believes the food system needs a revolution

toggle caption Peter Menzel

I think it would start with transforming our agricultural production system to one that was focused on food for people instead of animals and automobiles. We would need to change our electoral system so that we could elect officials who were interested in public health rather than corporate health. We would need to fix our economy so that Wall Street favors corporations who have social values and public health values as part of their corporate mission. Those are revolutionary concepts at this point because they seem so far from what is attainable. But I think if we don't work on that now, if we do not do what we can to advocate for a better food system, we won't get it. And it's only if we advocate for it that we have a chance of getting it. And you never know, sometimes you get lucky. …

I tell people that they can't do it on their own, that even the act of going into a grocery store and trying to make healthy choices means that you, as an individual, are up against an entire food system that is aimed at getting you to eat the most profitable foods possible, regardless of their effects on health and the environment. So you have to join organizations. You have to join with other people who are interested in the same issues and concerned about the same problems and get together with them to set some goals for what you'd like to do and then work towards those goals. Because if you don't do it, who will?

A separate storm system affecting the northern Rockies will move across the Upper Midwest into New England through Wednesday.

Montana and western North Dakota are experiencing snowfall Monday, and scattered showers are affecting areas in Iowa, Kansas, Missouri and Illinois.

The storm will strengthen by Tuesday, bringing snow to Minnesota and northern Michigan. Heavy rain is also possible from the Gulf Coast up into the Northeast.

On Wednesday, snow will pass through Wisconsin and Michigan, with lake-effect snow picking up later in the day.

Snowfall totals are expected to be 3 to 6 inches from North Dakota to northern Michigan through Wednesday, with higher amounts possible in northern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.

Conditions are expected to clear in most of the country by Thanksgiving, except for lingering lake-effect snow and gusty winds across the Northeast and the Pacific Northwest.

The two storm systems could cause flight delays and dangerous driving conditions, as 82 million people in the United States are projected to travel at least 50 miles from home during the Thanksgiving holiday period from Tuesday to Dec. 1, according to the AAA.

""In regard to air travel, this is going to be the busiest Thanksgiving that we have on record,"" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said at a news conference Monday afternoon.

""The airports are going to be packed,"" Duffy added, encouraging all Thanksgiving flyers to arrive at airports early.

Tuesday will be the busiest travel day, with 52,000 scheduled flights, Duffy said.

Because of weather concerns, Duffy advised travelers to stay in touch with their airlines and to check their flight statuses on their airlines' apps.

Drawing from the Transportation Department's civility campaign, which was launched last week, Duffy encouraged people to have common courtesy, civility and patience when traveling.

He urged Thanksgiving flyers to ""say please and thank you"" to their pilots and flight attendants.

He also asked people to practice ""dressing with some respect"" at airports.

""Whether it's a pair of jeans and a decent shirt, I would encourage people to maybe dress a little better,"" Duffy said. ""Let's try not to wear slippers and pajamas as we come to the airport.""

Islamabad, Pakistan – When the United Nations Security Council on Monday adopted a United States-authored resolution that paves the way for a transitional administration and an International Stabilisation Force (ISF) in Gaza, Pakistan – which was presiding over the council – had a seemingly contradictory response.

Asim Iftikhar Ahmed, Pakistan’s permanent representative to the UN, thanked the US for tabling the resolution and voted in its favour. But he also said Pakistan was not entirely satisfied with the outcome, and warned that “some critical suggestions” from Pakistan were not included in the final text.

Though the resolution promises a “credible pathway” to Palestinian statehood, Ahmed, in his comments to the council, said it did not spell that path out, and did not clarify the role of the UN, a proposed Board of Peace (BoP) to oversee Gaza’s governance, or the mandate of the ISF.

“Those are all crucial aspects with a bearing on the success of this endeavour. We earnestly hope that further details in coming weeks will provide the much-needed clarity on these issues,” he said.

But the country had already endorsed US President Donald Trump’s 20-point Gaza ceasefire plan in September – the basis for the UN resolution. And while several other Arab and Muslim countries have also cautiously supported the resolution, Pakistan, with the largest army among them, is widely expected to play a key role in the ISF.

The vote in favour of the resolution, coupled with the suggestions that Pakistan still has questions it needs answers to, represents a careful tightrope walk that Islamabad will need to navigate as it faces questions at home over possible military deployment in Gaza, say analysts.

“The US playbook is clear and has a pro-Israel tilt. Yet, we need to recognise that this is the best option that we have,” Salman Bashir, former Pakistani foreign secretary, told Al Jazeera. “After the sufferings inflicted on the people of Gaza, we did not have any option but to go along.”

Pakistan’s rising geopolitical value

In recent weeks, Pakistan’s top leaders have engaged in hectic diplomacy with key Middle Eastern partners.

Last weekend, Jordan’s King Abdullah II visited Islamabad and met Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Field Marshal Asim Munir, the army chief. Munir had earlier travelled to Amman in October, as well as to Cairo in Egypt.

Pakistan has traditionally had close relations with Gulf states, and those ties have tightened amid Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza. Pakistan has long called for “Palestinian self-determination and the establishment of a sovereign, independent and contiguous State of Palestine based on pre-1967 borders with al-Quds al-Sharif [Jerusalem] as its capital”.

But in recent weeks, Pakistan – the only Muslim nation with nuclear weapons – has also emerged as a key actor in the region’s security calculations, courted by both the United States and important Arab allies.

In September, Pakistan signed a Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement (SMDA) with Saudi Arabia, days after Israel had struck Doha, the Qatari capital. Then, in October, Prime Minister Sharif and Field Marshal Munir joined Trump and a bevy of other world leaders in Egypt’s Sharm el-Sheikh for the formal signing ceremony of the Gaza ceasefire agreement. Sharif lavished Trump with praise on the occasion.

By then, Trump had already described Munir as his “favourite field marshal”. Following a brief escalation with India in May, during which Pakistan said it shot down Indian jets, Munir met Trump in the Oval Office in June, an unprecedented visit for a serving Pakistani military chief who is not head of state.

In late September, Munir visited Washington again, this time with Sharif. The prime minister and army chief met Trump and promoted potential investment opportunities, including Pakistan’s rare earth minerals.

Now, Pakistan’s government is mulling its participation in the ISF. Though the government has not made any decision, senior officials have publicly commented favourably about the idea. “If Pakistan has to participate in it, then I think it will be a matter of pride for us,” Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on October 28. “We will be proud to do it.”

That’s easier said than done, cautioned some analysts.

Palestine is an emotive issue in Pakistan, which does not recognise Israel. The national passport explicitly states it cannot be used for travel to Israel, and any suggestion of military cooperation with Israeli forces – or even de facto recognition of Israel – remains politically fraught.

That makes the prospect of troop deployment to Gaza a highly sensitive subject for politicians and the military alike.

Government keeps cards close to chest

Officially, the government has been opaque about its position on joining the ISF.

Even while describing any participation in the force as a cause for pride, Defence Minister Asif said the government would consult parliament and other institutions before making any decision.

“The government will take a decision after going through the process, and I don’t want to preempt anything,” he said.

In a weekly press briefing earlier this month, Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said the question of Pakistan’s contribution would be decided “after consultation at the highest level”.

“The decision will be taken in due course, as and when required. Certain level of leadership has stated that the decision will be taken with the advice of the government,” he said.

Al Jazeera reached out to Asif, the defence minister, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, and the military’s media wing, the Inter-Services Public Relations, but received no response.

Legal, operational ambiguities

Some retired senior officers say Pakistan will not decide the matter behind closed doors.

Muhammad Saeed, a three-star general who served as Chief of General Staff until his 2023 retirement, said he expects the terms of reference and rules of engagement for any ISF deployment to be debated in public forums, including Pakistan’s National Security Council and parliament.

“This is such a sensitive topic; it has to be debated publicly, and no government can possibly keep it under wraps. So once the ISF structure becomes clear, I am certain that Pakistani decision-making will be very inclusive and the public will know about the details,” he told Al Jazeera.

Kamran Bokhari, senior director at the New Lines Institute for Strategy and Policy in Washington, DC, said the mutual defence agreement with Saudi Arabia meant that Pakistani troops in Gaza would likely be representing both countries. He, however, added that Pakistan would likely have participated in the ISF even without the Saudi pact.

Still, the lack of details about the ISF and Gaza’s governance in the UN resolution remains a stumbling block, say experts.

Several countries on the council said the resolution left key elements ambiguous, including the composition, structure and terms of reference for both the BoP and the ISF. China, which abstained, also described the text as “vague and unclear” on critical elements.

The resolution asks for the Gaza Strip to be “demilitarised” and for the “permanent decommissioning of weapons from non-state armed groups”, a demand that Hamas has rejected.

Hamas said the resolution failed to meet Palestinian rights and sought to impose an international trusteeship on Gaza that Palestinians and resistance factions oppose.

So far, the US has sent nearly 200 personnel, including a general, to establish a Civil-Military Coordination Center (CMCC) near Gaza on Israeli territory. The centre will monitor humanitarian aid and act as a base from which the ISF is expected to operate.

US-based media outlet Politico reported last month that Pakistan, Azerbaijan and Indonesia – all Muslim-majority states – were among the top contenders to supply troops for the ISF.

Meanwhile, the United Arab Emirates, which joined the Abraham Accords in 2020 and recognised Israel in Trump’s first tenure, has said it will not participate until there is clarity on the legal framework.

King Abdullah of Jordan also warned that without a clear mandate for the ISF, it would be difficult to make the plan succeed.

Costs, incentives and Pakistan’s historical role

Bokhari argued Pakistan has limited options, adding that many of its close allies are “deeply committed” to the initiative and have sought Islamabad’s participation.

“Pakistan’s economic and financial problems mean it will need to reciprocate militarily in order to secure” the goodwill of the US and Islamabad’s Gulf allies, he said. “We have to assume that the current civilian-military leadership is aware of the domestic political risks.”

Others point to Pakistan’s long experience with UN peacekeeping. As of September 2025, UN figures show Pakistan has contributed more than 2,600 personnel to UN missions, just below Indonesia’s 2,700, ranking Pakistan sixth overall.

Qamar Cheema, executive director of the Islamabad-based Sanober Institute, said Pakistan has emerged as a security stabiliser for the Middle East and has “extensive experience of providing support in conflict zones in the past”.

Pakistan currently faces security challenges on both its borders – with India to its east and Taliban-ruled Afghanistan to the west. But it “may not have to cut troops from its eastern or western borders, since the number of troops [needed in Gaza] may not be that big, as various countries are also sending troops,” Cheema told Al Jazeera.

Saeed, the retired general, said Pakistan’s historic position on Palestine remained intact and that its prior peacekeeping experience meant that its troops were well-equipped to help the ISF.

“Pakistan has one of the richest experiences when it comes to both peacekeeping and peace enforcement through the UN. We have a sizeable force, with a variety of experience in maintaining peace and order,” he said.

“The hope is that we can perhaps provide help that can eliminate the violence, lead to peace, bring humanitarian aid in Gaza and implement the UN resolution,” the former general said.

Domestic political risks and the Israeli factor

Despite those arguments, many in Pakistan question the feasibility – and political acceptability – of serving alongside or coordinating with Israeli forces.

Bashir, the former foreign secretary, acknowledged the risks and said the demand that Hamas deweaponise made the ISF “a difficult mission”.

Still, he said, “realism demands that we go along with a less than perfect solution”.

Bokhari of New Lines Institute said stakeholders often sort out details “on the go” in the early stages of such missions.

“Of course, there is no way Pakistan or any other participating nation can avoid coordinating with Israel,” he said.

Saeed, however, disagreed. He said ISF would likely be a coalition in which one partner coordinates any dealings with Israeli forces, meaning Pakistani troops might not have direct contact with Israel.

“There are other countries potentially part of ISF who have relations with Israel. It is likely they will take the commanding role in ISF, and thus they will be the ones to engage with them, and not Pakistan,” he said. He added Pakistan’s involvement – if it happens – would be narrowly focused on maintaining the ceasefire and protecting Palestinian lives.

But Omar Mahmood Hayat, another retired three-star general, warned that any operational tie to Israel “will ignite domestic backlash and erode public trust”.

Hayat said Pakistan has no diplomatic ties with Israel “for principled reasons” and that blurring that line, even citing humanitarian considerations, would invite domestic confusion and controversy.

“This is not just a moral dilemma, but it is also a strategic contradiction,” he said. “It weakens our diplomatic posture.”",2025-11-22 00:00:00,metaphor,Stumbling used as metaphor for making mistakes; navigating for managing through,metaphor,figurative,1,literal,0.8081241,0.19187587,0.8081241,False

Belief in witchcraft is deeply entrenched across Ghana, cutting through both rural and urban life, explains John Azumah, the director of the Sanneh Institute in Accra, a research centre, which has long supported survivors of witchcraft accusations and is part of a coalition pressing for legal and social reform.

“It’s not just a Ghanaian thing,” Azumah says. “Belief in the supernatural is so powerful in Africa. It’s very strong in Nigeria, in East Africa ... What is unique about Ghana is the camps in the north.”

Although accusations occur in other parts of Ghana, women in those areas are more likely to be ostracised than banished. Meanwhile, in the north, the accused are often sent to the “witch camps” that usually serve as their last refuge.

The camps are often located near or within villages and are overseen by traditional priests or camp chiefs, typically appointed by village leaders. The camp in Gambaga is the oldest and most well-known, but others exist in Kukuo, Gnani, and Kpatinga.

Women, often elderly, widowed, or without strong family protection, are most frequently targeted, Azumah says. Many, too, are “the poorest of the poor”, he added. Once accused, they are vulnerable to mob violence, abandonment, or lifelong banishment.

Sometimes, the accusations have deadly consequences. In July 2020, 90-year-old Akua Denteh was lynched in a public market after being accused. Her brutal killing shocked the nation, and sparked calls for reform.

“It is violence against women - a demonisation of women,” Azumah says, explaining how witchcraft is not always viewed as inherently evil. Women accused of witchcraft are feared and condemned, while men who are accused of it are thought to use it for protection or good, he explains.

Almost any misfortune can be interpreted as evidence of witchcraft, says Azumah. “Sometimes people are just accusing others maliciously, or to get them out of the way for some reason. It could be fights over property or farmland, or it could just be pure jealousy, like somebody's child is doing well in school.”

Once a woman is accused and sent to a camp, she may undergo a traditional ""trial"", involving the slaughter of a chicken or guinea fowl. ""When the guinea fowl or chicken is dying, the position of the body determines the outcome [of the trial],"" explains Alasan Shei, the traditional spiritual leader who oversees the Gnani camp. ""If it falls on its back with the head facing up, it means the woman has some witchcraft. But if it lies face down, then she is innocent.""

Yet even when this ritual “proves” innocence, returning home is rare. For most women, the accusation alone is enough to drive them from their communities.

“Most often, the communities where the women are accused will not be ready to accept them back,” says Shei.",2025-11-23 00:00:00,literal,Factual reporting on data and economics,literal,literal,0,literal,0.630812,0.369188,0.630812,True

The music was dedicated to the 1950s-70s legacy of the late Art Blakey and Thelonious Monk bassist, oud player and early global-music pioneer Ahmed Abdul-Malik, the inspiration for the group’s work. When Thomas emerged from his trance, he was astonished to hear that an ecstatic crowd had been dancing the night away around him.

View image in fullscreen The artwork for Sama’a (Audition) by أحمد [Ahmed].

He shouldn’t have been surprised. Since أحمد [Ahmed]’s inception, their collective heat has fused abstract improv and groove music from all over the world: Duke Ellington, Thelonious Monk, dub, jungle, electronics, and the 1990s free-improv of Derek Bailey, Lol Coxhill and drummer Steve Noble have all inspired Thomas. Saxophonist Seymour Wright has absorbed the sax vocabulary of Evan Parker and the insights into collective improv and avant-swing of AMM drummer and teacher Eddie Prévost. Eclectic partners Joel Grip (bass) and Antonin Gerbal (drums) power and expand these infectious, volatile energies.

The Arabic term sama’a loosely translates as meditative listening to music and poetry, taken from Thomas’s perspective as a follower of Sufism, and this new set’s four tracks manifest that spirit. The opening Ya Annas (Oh, People) joins ghostly split-note sax sounds with graceful bowed-bass figures before turning to a pulsating piano-vamping dance and then a furious melee, while Isma’a (Listen) is a drum’n’bass hook that evolves into hoarsely urgent free-sax improv against exhilaratingly splashy, pummelling piano chords. El Haris (Anxious) resolves brittle, pad-flapping horn exhalations and long-tone harmonies into a gripping robotic strut, and Farah ‘Alaiyna (Joy Upon Us) begins as delightfully dissonant folk-dance and becomes rocketing jazz swing. The group’s Monk tribute follows in 2026 which on this evidence is a riveting prospect.

Guitarist John Scofield and bassist Dave Holland have been regular collaborators for years, but Memories of Home (ECM) is their first duo album, equally sharing their boppishly hip, country-bluesy, warmly engaging originals. Scofield’s voicelike harmonies and sure-footed chord-rooted improv on his dreamy Meant to Be, and Holland’s deep, enveloping tone on his luxuriously languid swinger Mr B (Dedicated to Ray Brown) are highlights of a very classy set.

Unseparate (Out of Your Head), the second release by Canadian composer and flautist/saxophonist Anna Webber’s powerful big band co-led with her saxophonist compatriot Angela Morris, joins this inventive pair’s jazz, contemporary-classical and folk enthusiasms in a subtle balance of their ingenious arrangements and their fine young lineup’s improv ideas.

Dharmendra Deol, who became one of India’s most prominent actors and a Bollywood action hero, has died aged 89.

Survived by two wives and six children, Dharmendra had been ill for the past month. He died at home in Mumbai, Indian media reported on Monday.

There was no official statement from the actor’s family, but several of his contemporaries, including actor Amitabh Bachchan, gathered at a crematorium in the Mumbai suburb of Juhu for his funeral.

“A massive mega star, the embodiment of a hero in mainstream cinema,” producer and director Karan Johar, who cast Dharmendra in his 2023 film, Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani, (Rocky and Rani’s Love Story), wrote in an Instagram post.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered his condolences, saying the actor’s death marks the end of an era in Indian cinema.

“He was an iconic film personality, a phenomenal actor who brought charm and depth to every role he played. The manner in which he played diverse roles struck a chord with countless people,” Modi wrote on social media.

Top actor of his generation

Known to his legion of fans by his first name, Dharmendra acted in more than 300 films in a career spanning more than six decades.

Often called Bollywood’s “He-Man”, Dharmendra combined the old-school heroism of an action star with the tenderness of a romantic lead, making him one of India’s most iconic actors.

Born in Punjab province in 1935, Dharmendra won a talent show organised by a film magazine, moving to Mumbai and acting in his first film in 1960.

In the years that followed, he appeared in everything from arthouse films to soft romances, action films and goofy comedies, making him a top actor of his generation.

Notable films included Bollywood cult classic Sholay (Embers), in which he played one half of a team of small-time thugs tasked with catching a bandit. The film, which was released in 1975, has become part of Indian popular culture, and Dharmendra’s dialogue from the film has influenced movies ever since.

Dharmendra married his first wife, Prakash Kaur, before he found fame.

After starring alongside Hema Malini in several films, he married her in 1980, without divorcing Kaur.

His phone, by all appearances, had not rung.

NFL Media reports that the Saints have invited Tucker to a kicker tryout. Cade York also will participate, per the report.

Some believed Tucker’s off-field baggage coupled with a lackluster 2024 season with the Ravens (73.3-percent field-goal conversion rate) would make it more difficult for him to get a shot. He’s now getting one, with the Saints.

Tucker, a five-time first-team All-Pro, was accused by multiple women of misconduct during massage-therapy sessions. He denied the allegations, and he was never charged criminally nor sued civilly. The league investigated after reporting earlier this year by the Baltimore Banner. Cut by the Ravens in May, Tucker accepted a 10-game suspension without a full-blown hearing or appeal.

Seven years ago, Tucker missed the first extra point of his career in the final seconds of a game against the Saints, resulting in a one-point loss by Baltimore.

Al Jazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/11/18/trumps-war-on-south-africa-betrays-a-sinister-threat,Trump’s war on South Africa betrays a sinister threat,"When US President Donald Trump declared that South Africa “should not even be” in the G20 and then took to Truth Social on November 7 to announce that no American official would attend this year’s summit in Johannesburg on account of a so-called “genocide” of white farmers in the country, I was not surprised. His outburst was not an exception but the latest expression of a long Western tradition of disciplining African sovereignty. Western leaders have long tried to shut down African agency through mischaracterisations, from branding Congolese nationalist Patrice Lumumba a “Soviet puppet” to calling anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela a “terrorist”, and Trump’s assault on South Africa falls squarely into that pattern.

As Africa pushes for a stronger voice in global governance, the Trump administration has intensified efforts to isolate Pretoria. South Africa’s growing diplomatic assertiveness, from BRICS expansion to climate finance negotiations, has challenged conservative assumptions that global leadership belongs exclusively to the West.

On February 7, Trump signed an executive order halting US aid to South Africa. He alleged that the government’s land expropriation policy discriminates against white farmers and amounts to uncompensated confiscation. Nothing could be further from the truth. South African law permits expropriation only through due process and compensation, with limited exceptions set out in the Constitution. Trump’s claims ignore this legal reality, revealing a deliberate preference for distortion over fact.

Soon after, the administration amplified its rollout of a refugee admissions policy that privileged Afrikaners, citing once again discredited claims of government persecution. What is clear is that Washington has deliberately heightened tensions with Pretoria, searching for any pretext to cast South Africa as an adversary. This selective compassion, extended only to white South Africans, exposes a racialised hierarchy of concern that has long shaped conservative engagement with the continent.

Yet, for months, South African officials have firmly rejected these claims, pointing to judicial rulings, official statistics, and constitutional safeguards that show no evidence of systematic persecution, let alone a “genocide” of white farmers. Indeed, as independent experts repeatedly confirmed, there is no credible evidence whatsoever to support the claim that white farmers in South Africa are being systematically targeted as part of a campaign of genocide. Their rebuttals highlight a basic imbalance: Pretoria is operating through verifiable data and institutional process, while Washington relies on exaggeration and ideological grievance.

At the same time, as host of this year’s G20 Summit, Pretoria is using the platform to champion a more cooperative and equitable global order. For South Africa, chairing the G20 is not only symbolic, but strategic, an attempt to expand the influence of countries long excluded from shaping the rules of global governance.

Trump’s G20 boycott embodies a transnational crusade shaped by Christian righteousness. Trump’s rhetoric reduces South Africa to a moral backdrop for American authority rather than recognising it as a sovereign partner with legitimate aspirations. The boycott also mirrors a wider effort to discredit multilateral institutions that dilute American exceptionalism.

This stance is rooted in a long evangelical-imperial tradition, one that fused theology with empire and cast Western dominance as divinely sanctioned. The belief that Africa required Western moral rescue emerged in the nineteenth century, when European missionaries declared it a Christian duty to civilise and redeem the continent. The wording has changed, but the logic endures, recasting African political agency as a civilisational error rather than a legitimate expression of sovereignty. This moralised paternalism did not disappear with decolonisation. It simply adapted, resurfacing whenever African nations assert themselves on the world stage.

American evangelical and conservative Christian networks wield significant influence inside the Republican Party. Their political and media ecosystem, featuring Fox News and the Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN), routinely frames multilateral institutions, global aid, and international law as subordinate to American sovereignty and Christian civilisation. These networks shape not only rhetoric but policy, turning fringe narratives into foreign policy priorities.

They also amplify unproven claims of Christian persecution abroad, particularly in countries such as Nigeria and Ethiopia, to legitimise American political and military interference. Trump’s fixation with South Africa follows the same script: a fabricated crisis crafted to thrill, galvanise, and reassure a conservative Christian base. South Africa becomes another stage for this performance.

In this distorted narrative, South Africa is not a constitutional democracy acting through strong, independent courts and institutions. Instead, Africa’s most developed country is stripped of its standing and portrayed as a flawed civilisation in need of Western correction. For conservative Christian nationalists, African decision-making is not autonomous agency but a supervised privilege granted only when African decisions align with Western priorities.

By casting South Africa as illegitimate in the G20, invoking false claims of genocide and land seizures, and penalising Pretoria’s ICJ case with aid cuts, Trump asserts that only the West can define global legitimacy and moral authority, a worldview anchored in Christian-nationalist authority. Trump’s crusade is punishment, not principle, and it seeks to deter African autonomy itself.

On many occasions, I have walked the streets of Alexandra, a Johannesburg township shaped by apartheid’s spatial design, where inequality remains brutally vivid. Alexandra squeezes more than one million residents into barely 800 hectares (about 2,000 acres). A significant portion of its informal housing sits on the floodplain of the Jukskei River, where settlements crowd narrow pathways and fragile infrastructure. Here, the consequences of structural inequality are unmistakable, yet they vanish entirely within Trump’s constructed crisis.

These communities sit only a few kilometres from Sandton, a spacious, leafy, and affluent suburb that is home to some of the country’s most expensive properties. The vast and entrenched gulf between these adjacent lands is essentially a living symbol of the profound inequality Trump is willing to overlook and legitimise as a global norm, built on selective moral outrage and racialised indifference.

In Alexandra, the struggle for dignity, equality, and inclusion is not a religious American fantasy, but a practical quest for the rights that apartheid and wider global injustice sought to deny. Their struggle mirrors the wider global fight against structures that concentrate wealth and power in a few hands. They, too, deserve better.

This is the human condition Trump’s pseudo-morality refuses to acknowledge. This is why South Africa’s global leadership matters.

Earlier this year, South Africa’s President Cyril Ramaphosa commissioned a landmark G20 Global Inequality Report, chaired by Nobel-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz. It found that the world’s richest 1 percent have captured more than 40 percent of new wealth since 2000 and that more than 80 percent of humanity now lives in conditions the World Bank classifies as high inequality.

The Johannesburg G20 Summit seeks to reform multilateral development banks, such as the World Bank, to confront a global financial system that sidelines developing countries and perpetuates economic injustice. While South Africa turns to recognised multilateral tools such as the ICJ and G20 reform, the US has moved in the opposite direction.

Under Trump, Washington has sanctioned the International Criminal Court, abandoned key UN bodies, and rejected scrutiny from UN human rights experts, reflecting a Christian-nationalist doctrine that treats American power as inherently absolute and answerable to no one.

South Africa offers an alternative vision rooted in global cooperation, shared responsibility, equality, and adherence to international law, a vision that unsettles those invested in unilateral power. The US recasts decolonisation as sin, African equality as disruption, and American dominance as divinely ordained. Trump’s attacks reveal how deeply this worldview still shapes American foreign policy.

Yet the world has moved beyond colonial binaries. African self-determination can no longer be framed as immoral. Human rights are universal, and dignity belongs to us all.

Chelsea will host Barcelona at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday in a hugely consequential Matchday 5 League Phase clash in the UEFA Champions League (UCL).

Chelsea and Barcelona, both former Champions League winners, head into this highly anticipated showdown with an identical seven points from their opening four fixtures, making this match pivotal as both sides aim to climb the standings in search of automatic top-eight qualification into the last-16 of the competition.

The star-studded clubs are riding recent hot streaks with Chelsea, bolstered by a trio of recent wins against Tottenham, Wolves and Burnley, closing in on the Premier League’s top spot behind table-topping Arsenal, while reigning La Liga champions Barcelona are again competing with archrival Real Madrid for the domestic title.

Here is all to know before their epic clash at Stamford Bridge:

What happened in Chelsea’s last Premier League match?

Goals from Pedro Neto and Enzo Fernandez earned Chelsea a 2-0 victory at lowly Burnley on Saturday.

The result moved the Blues past Manchester City and into outright second on the English Premier League (EPL) table behind leaders Arsenal.

Enzo Maresca’s side will clash with the Gunners next Sunday in a top-of-the-table premiership showdown at Stamford Bridge.

What happened in Barcelona’s last La Liga match?

Barcelona secured a dominant 4-0 victory over 10-man Athletic Bilbao on Saturday in their first match back at their home venue Nou Camp since May 2023.

Ferran Torres had two goals for Barca with Robert Lewandowski and Fermin Lopez also adding to the scoresheet.

Athletic lost midfielder Oihan Sancet to a red card in the 54th minute after he was sent off for a crude challenge on Lopez.

Lewandowski, who scored the opener, said he will remember kicking the first goal at the team’s rebuilt Nou Camp stadium “forever”.

“Today was a special day, not only for me but for everyone. Because of this I’m very happy that I could score the first goal, coming back to the Nou Camp,” Lewandowski told Barca One.

“I have so much experience playing in different stadiums, but here is something special. I’m very proud of myself and also of the team because we did a great job today and we won.”

What happened in the last UCL League Phase match for both clubs?

Chelsea were held to a shock 2-2 draw by Azerbaijan side Qarabag in their last outing on November 5, while Barcelona had to rally from a goal down and split the points in a 3-3 result against Club Brugge in Belgium.

Where do Chelsea and Barcelona sit on the UCL League Phase standings?

Barcelona are currently 11th on the UEFA League Phase standings with Chelsea right behind in 12th position. Both sides have two wins, one draw and one loss from their four fixtures.

Teams need to finish the League Phase standings in a top-eight position to secure direct qualification into the round of 16. Those clubs that finish in ladder positions 9-to-24 will enter into a home and away playoffs to reach the last-16.

Where did Barcelona finish in last season’s Champions League?

The Catalan club were widely expected to reach the Champions League final but were eliminated by Inter, who staged a late comeback in the second leg of their record-equalling semifinal.

Palmer out of Barca clash

Chelsea star Cole Palmer is close to returning but will miss the UCL clash with Barcelona before the top-of-the-table Premier League showdown against Arsenal, Maresca said on Monday.

Palmer, who suffered a groin injury in August before returning with back-to-back goals against Brentford and Bayern Munich, was nearing his comeback, but an accident at home delayed his return.

The 23-year-old England international stubbed his toe on a door during the night, resulting in a fracture.

“Cole is wearing a (protective) boot,” Maresca told reporters.

“We don’t know when he will be back but for sure it will be soon. He’s already on the pitch, he’s already touching the ball and the feeling (for him) is good.

“I don’t think he will be available for these two games (Barca and Arsenal), but he is doing well.”

Barca’s Lopez showing summer suitors Chelsea what they missed

Fermin Lopez, 22, is establishing himself as a regular starter for manager Hansi Flick’s side, even though outside of Spain he is not yet a household name.

Chelsea know plenty about Lopez, though, having had a 40-million-euro ($46m) bid rebuffed by Barcelona in the summer. In Tuesday’s Champions League fixture, the attacking midfielder will be one of their main goal threats.

Flick was eager to keep Lopez, while Barca were open to selling him at the right price, which Chelsea did not reach.

“I’m convinced that he will stay, but in the end I don’t know what happens. We have to wait. I am really happy when the market is closed,” said Flick in August, eventually getting his wish.

Despite his improvement and obvious utility for Barca – or maybe even because of it – he is an asset the Catalan giants could cash in.

If he shines at Stamford Bridge, it would be no surprise to see Chelsea’s interest in the midfielder reawaken and his price tag rise further.

Form guide: last five matches

Chelsea: W-L-W-W-W (Premier League, most recent result last)

Barcelona: W-L-W-W-W (La Liga, most recent result last)

Head-to-head: Chelsea-Barcelona

The two clubs have faced each other 14 times, with both teams winning four times while six ended as draws.

The sides last met at the round of 16 in the 2017-2018 Champions League with Barcelona progressing to the quarterfinals 4-1 on aggregate. Argentinian superstar Lionel Messi was the standout in the second leg with two goals – including his 100th UEFA Champions League goal – on the night.

Chelsea’s team news

Oft-injured Reece James was taken off at halftime of Saturday’s EPL fixture at Burnley, but the Chelsea captain’s early finish was preplanned and not the result of a new injury, according to Maresca, so he is expected to be available for team selection.

“The idea was to manage Reece,” said Maresca. “This is the reason why he played 45 minutes [only]. It was planned.

“It’s not easy, because me personally, I would like Reece to continue, but we need to protect Reece.”

French centre-back Wesley Fofana, who was omitted from the matchday squad against Burnley, is believed to be match fit ahead of the Barca clash.

Click here to share on social media

United States President Donald Trump has unveiled a national initiative to mobilise artificial intelligence (AI) for accelerating scientific breakthroughs.

Trump signed an executive order on Monday to establish “The Genesis Mission”, the latest iteration of his administration’s aggressive strategy for spurring AI development through deregulation, infrastructure investment and public-private collaboration.

Trump’s order directs US Energy Secretary Chris Wright to unite scientists and technologies at the country’s 17 national laboratories into “one cooperative system for research”.

Under the initiative, US supercomputers and data resources will be integrated to create a “closed-loop AI experimentation platform”, according to the order.

The White House, which likened the initiative to the Apollo programme that put the first man on the moon, said priority areas of focus would include the “greatest scientific challenges of our time,” such as nuclear fusion, semiconductors, critical materials and space exploration.

Michael Kratsios, the White House’s top science adviser, said the initiative took a “revolutionary approach” to scientific research.

“The Genesis Mission connects world-class scientific data with the most advanced American AI to unlock breakthroughs in medicine, energy, materials science, and beyond,” Kratsios said.

Chipmaker Nvidia and AI startup Anthropic said on Monday that they were partnering with the Trump administration on the initiative.

“Uniting the National Labs, USG, industry, and academia, this effort will connect America’s leading supercomputers, AI systems, and next-generation quantum machines into the most complex scientific instrument ever built – accelerating breakthroughs in energy, discovery, and national security,” Nvidia said in a social media post, referring to the US government (USG).

Since re-entering the White House, Trump has made cutting red tape to fast-track the development of AI a key plank of his economic agenda.

Last week, Trump called on the US Congress to pass legislation to create a national standard for AI, while criticising state governments over their laws regulating the emerging technology.

“Overregulation by the States is threatening to undermine this Growth Engine,” Trump said on his platform, Truth Social.

NBC News Think,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/people-younger-brains-muscle-mass-less-visceral-fat-rcna245185,"People with more muscle mass and less visceral fat have younger brains, study finds","As you age, you gradually lose muscle mass and gain visceral body fat, a type of fat deep inside your body that surrounds your heart, kidneys and other organs. Now, scientists say the ratio of visceral fat to muscle can uncover clues about your brain health.

People with higher muscle mass and a lower visceral fat-to-muscle ratio tend to have younger brains, according to research being presented next week at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America.

“We know that the age of a person, in terms of their appearance, might not match with their chronological age,” said senior study author Dr. Cyrus Raji. “Turns out, the age of their organs might not match their chronological age either.”

One reason the findings are so important is because chronological age — and therefore an aging brain — is “by far” the top risk factor for developing Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia, said Raji, an associate professor of radiology and neurology at the Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.

“Risk of disease crosses organ systems,” Raji said. “Disease doesn’t just neatly respect the anatomical boundaries of one organ system.”

Previous research, including Raji’s own, has studied the relationship between visceral fat and health outcomes such as brain volume loss, cognitive impairment and structural changes in the brain.

The study involved 1,164 healthy people whose average chronological age was 55.17. About 52% were women and 39% were nonwhite. All underwent a whole-body MRI that looked at brain, fat and muscle tissue.

To determine participants’ brain age, Raji and his colleagues used an algorithm that had been trained on the MRI scans of 5,500 healthy adults ages 18 to 89. The average brain age of study participants was 56.04 — older than their average chronological age. Researchers called this difference the “brain age gap.”

The average brain age gap was 0.69 years, meaning participants’ brains looked slightly older than they should. However, this metric was not statistically significant.

Just as higher muscle mass and a lower visceral fat-to-muscle ratio corresponded to a younger brain age, lower muscle mass and a higher visceral fat-to-muscle ratio corresponded to an older brain age.

This link between body fat and brain age only held true for visceral fat, which is also known as hidden fat, active fat or deep belly fat. Subcutaneous fat, the layer of fat just below the skin’s surface, wasn’t associated with brain age, the study found.

“Visceral fat, which is the really terrible fat, [is] linked to a higher rate of diabetes, insulin resistance, prediabetic states, high cholesterol,” Raji said. “That leads to a higher inflammatory state in the body, which over time affects the brain. That’s the main mechanism by which we believe obesity can affect risk for Alzheimer’s disease.”

BMI reveals little of body composition

From a clinical perspective, the study results are on par with what Dr. Zhenqi Liu, the James M. Moss professor of diabetes at the University of Virginia School of Medicine, would expect.

“When people are very young and healthy, they tend to have more muscle mass and they will have [a] younger brain age,” said Liu, who wasn’t involved in the research.

Older adults, on the other hand, especially those living with chronic diseases such as diabetes or obesity, usually have lower muscle mass, Liu added. “I wouldn’t be surprised if their brain volume is decreased.”

Even so, the study reinforces that muscle health is vital to overall health, Liu said.

The limitations of body mass index, or BMI, as a measure of health are also on display in this research, Liu said. BMI is a standardized, nearly 200-year-old body fat metric calculated using your height and weight. But it’s fallen out of favor in recent years, namely because it doesn’t take into account how your fat — neither visceral nor subcutaneous — is distributed throughout your body.

A BMI of 30 or higher falls into the obese category. For Raji, his latest work demonstrates how a low BMI could disguise poor brain health.

“If you have more visceral fat and less muscle, you can have an older-looking brain,” Raji said. “That makes sense in terms of Alzheimer’s being a big risk factor — regardless of whatever the BMI would show.”

Liu favors two other approaches to assessing body composition. The first is waist circumference. Measurements beyond 35 inches for women or 40 inches for men increase your risk of heart disease and Type 2 diabetes, according to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. The second metric is the waist-hip ratio, which involves dividing your waist circumference by your hip circumference. According to the World Health Organization, this ratio shouldn’t exceed 0.85 for women or 0.9 for men.

Still, you can’t accurately measure your own visceral fat unless your doctor refers you for an MRI, which can assess the amount of fat under the skin and surrounding the organs. An elective full-body scan can cost up to $5,000.

The good news is, there are steps you can take to increase muscle mass and lower visceral fat without spending a dime.

How to build muscle and burn visceral fat

If it’s been ages since you’ve touched a dumbbell or gone for a long walk, fear not, said Siddhartha Angadi, a colleague of Liu’s and an associate professor of kinesiology at UVA’s School of Education and Human Development.

“Anyone can exercise — regardless of their age,” said Angadi, who wasn’t involved in the research. “There’s excellent data across the lifespan, across the health span, across multiple diseases showing that exercise is incredibly safe.”

Angadi recommends following the American College of Sports Medicine’s physical activity guidelines. At least twice a week, healthy adults 65 and younger are encouraged to do muscle-strengthening activities that work all major muscle groups.

“Do 10 to 15 different exercises,” Angadi said. “You want to do one to three sets; in each set, you want to have eight to 12 reps. Use machines if you’re not familiar with resistance training, which is a fancy way of saying weightlifting.”

Aerobic exercise is particularly effective at targeting visceral fat, Angadi said. The guidelines suggest 150 minutes of moderately intense aerobic activity every week.

“There’s nothing that can reverse brain aging,” Angadi said. “You can just slow the rate of it.”

Glenn Gaesser, a professor of exercise physiology at the Arizona State University College of Health Solutions, said baby steps can help build muscle and burn visceral fat.

“A lot of people think that it takes a lot to produce some sort of health benefit from exercise, and that is not necessarily true,” said Gaesser, who wasn’t part of the study. “The biggest return on investment is with the initial few minutes of exercise.”

For example, if you’re striving for the recommended 150 minutes of aerobics per week, your body will benefit most in those first 30 minutes, Gaesser said.

“Same with resistance training,” Gaesser said. “A lot of people may not want a gym membership, they may not want to go and lift weights, but you can do resistance training even with the weight of your own body.”

While Raji’s research doesn’t conclude that higher muscle mass and a lower visceral fat-to-muscle ratio guarantee better brain health, it spotlights the relationship between the brain and the musculoskeletal system, Gaesser said. When you work out, your muscles release chemical signals thought to positively influence the brain and other tissues.

“This is why individuals who perform regular exercise tend to have lower risk of cognitive decline, dementia, Alzheimer’s and the like,” Gaesser said. “If you want a healthy brain, you need to have healthy muscle.”

Gaesser added, “It’s not surprising that the single best predictor of whether or not you’re going to spend the last years of your life in a nursing home or assisted living is fitness.”

Strength training crucial for healthy weight loss

In October, Michael Snyder turned 70, an age when muscle mass and strength are naturally in decline. He’s also taking a GLP-1 medication for diabetes.

As GLP-1 usage has surged in recent years, so too has awareness of the decline in muscle mass that can accompany significant weight loss, said Snyder, the Stanford W. Ascherman professor of genetics at the Stanford University School of Medicine, who wasn’t part of the study.

“If you’re on [GLP-1s], you should be strength training,” Snyder said. “I lift weights every day.”

Dr. David D’Alessio, chief of the division of endocrinology, metabolism and nutrition at the Duke University School of Medicine, stressed that muscle loss isn’t unique to people taking GLP-1s.

“If you lose weight by restricting calories — that is, going on a diet — or if you lose weight by bariatric surgery, or if you lose weight by taking Ozempic, you’re going to lose some fat mass and some lean mass,” said D’Alessio, who wasn’t involved in the study. “It’s going to be about 30% lean, 70% fat. About half of lean mass on these measures is muscle.”

Even for people who aren’t trying to lose weight, strong muscles are necessary for a long, healthy life, Snyder said.

“There’s a ton of interest in longevity these days,” Snyder said. “Everybody wants to live forever, and to do that, you’re going to want to keep your mass up.”",2025-11-24 10:00:40+00:00,literal,Factual reporting on reporting and data,literal,literal,0,literal,0.8664964,0.13350356,0.8664964,True
Al Jazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/25/everyone-was-startled-thai-woman-due-for-cremation-found-alive-in-coffin,‘Everyone was startled’: Thai woman due for cremation found alive in coffin,"Reports say doctors diagnosed the woman with critically low blood sugar, likely leading to her weakened condition.

A woman in Thailand has shocked staff at a Buddhist temple when she started moving in her coffin after being brought in for cremation.

Wat Rat Prakhong Tham, a temple in the province of Nonthaburi on the outskirts of the capital, Bangkok, posted a video on its Facebook page, showing a woman lying in a white coffin in the back of a pick-up truck, slightly moving her arms and head, leaving temple staff bewildered.

Pairat Soodthoop, the temple’s general and financial affairs manager, told The Associated Press news agency on Monday that the 65-year-old woman’s brother drove her from the province of Phitsanulok to be cremated.

He said they heard a faint knock coming from the coffin.

“I was a bit surprised, so I asked them to open the coffin, and everyone was startled,” he said.

“I saw her opening her eyes slightly and knocking on the side of the coffin. She must have been knocking for quite some time.”

According to Pairat, the brother said his sister had been bedridden for about two years, when her health deteriorated and she became unresponsive, appearing to stop breathing two days ago.

The brother then placed her in a coffin and made the 500km (300-mile) journey to a hospital in Bangkok, to which the woman had previously expressed a wish to donate her organs.

The hospital refused to accept the brother’s offer as he didn’t have an official death certificate, Pairat said. His temple offers a free cremation service, which is why the brother approached them on Sunday, but was also refused due to the missing document.

The temple manager said that he was explaining to the brother how he could get a death certificate when they heard the knocking. They then assessed her and sent her to a nearby hospital.

The abbot said the temple would cover her medical expenses, according to Pairat.

According to the Thailand News website, doctors later diagnosed the woman with severe hypoglycaemia, or critically low blood sugar, and confirmed she had not experienced cardiac or respiratory failure.",2025-11-25 00:00:00,literal,Straightforward news about reporting,literal,literal,0,literal,0.9873771,0.012622882,0.9873771,True
The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/nov/19/i-never-wanted-to-sing-into-a-vacuum-scottish-folk-pioneer-dick-gaughans-fight-for-his-lost-music,‘I never wanted to sing into a vacuum’: Scottish folk pioneer Dick Gaughan’s fight for his lost music,"‘It felt to me as if the world had forgotten about the Frank Sinatra or Elvis Presley of folk, or a singular figure in the mould of Willie Nelson, Johnny Cash or Richard Thompson.” So says Colin Harper, curator of a slew of new releases celebrating the stunning music of Scottish musician Dick Gaughan. Harper had recently reconnected with his music after several decades, “and I couldn’t believe the quality of it. His singing and guitar playing were astonishing – he performed traditional songs and championed social justice so powerfully.”

But if you haven’t heard of the 77-year-old Gaughan, it’s not surprising: much of his work has been unavailable for years, the rights to it having been claimed by the label Celtic Music, who have not made it available digitally. Gaughan doesn’t recall receiving a royalty statement from the company in 40 years. He is battling for ownership and, in turn, hopes to help other veteran folk artists regain control of their catalogues. “To find that the music I made, that I put a lot of work into, is just not available – it’s like your life isn’t available,” he says.

Born in Glasgow in 1948, and raised in Leith in an impoverished musical family, Gaughan became a jobbing musician at 22, later recording 12 solo albums and multiple collaborations. Capable of both stunning delicacy and fiery spirit in his performances, he recorded nine sessions for John Peel (solo and in groups), who said during one of his 1977 shows: “He’s a singer so good that prolonged exposure to him could drive you daft.”

Gaughan became a much-loved regular at folk clubs up and down the country. Later in his career, he brilliantly led Emmylou Harris, Kate and Anna McGarrigle and Kate’s 21-year-old son Rufus Wainwright on folk ballad Wild Mountain Thyme, on a 1995 episode of Scottish/Irish TV show Transatlantic Sessions. “I was so lucky to work with Dick Gaughan at an impressionable age,” says Wainwright. “His ability affected my singing for the duration.”

Richard Hawley also saw him in the 2000s at Greystones folk club in Sheffield. “It was very quickly apparent to me that this man was a force to be reckoned with,” he says. “It was a night of powerful song that I’ll never forget.”

Gaughan’s most successful album, 1981’s Handful of Earth – a mixture of political songs and tender ballads recorded after he recovered from a breakdown – is still startling. Hawley calls it “another league away from most things in any genre of music I’ve ever heard”. It was a significant influence on Billy Bragg, who loved Gaughan’s version of The World Turned Upside Down, which he re-recorded and still performs regularly live. On the cover, Gaughan stands dressed in black like a Gaelic Johnny Cash, knee-deep in golden wheat, with a hulking cement works brooding behind him.

Harper, an author, composer and box-set compiler, was shocked to discover that only a 2019 CD remaster of this album, an introductory CD on Topic Records (gleaned from only three albums Gaughan released for that label) and a live recording from 1982, had been reissued in the last 20 years. “This is someone with a similar cultural standing in Scotland as Bert Jansch or Christy Moore in Ireland,” he says. “I felt that the universe was telling me I had to do something about this.”

So he assembled a team (working for nothing, like him, or at “ultra mates’ rates”) to license, promote and create a lavish seven-CD and DVD package, complete with liner notes and archive interviews, after several reissue labels rejected his approaches. Crowdfunding had facilitated other folk projects, he noticed, such as the forthcoming film about folklorist Doc Rowe, and the publication of fRoots magazine editor Ian A Anderson’s memoir, Alien Water. When Harper’s crowdfunding campaign launched in March, “we hoped that we might be able to raise £28,000 from fans within a month”. He remains shocked at what happened next. “We got that amount in a day.”

He raised £91,985 in total. It prompted him to curate other collections including Live at the BBC: 1972-79, released this month. But the Dick Gaughan Legacy Project, as it is now called, has not been without hurdles. Harper tried and failed to license material from Celtic Music, the entity that acquired several legendary folk labels in the 1980s, including Trailer and Leader (which had gone bankrupt).

Today, Celtic Music claims ownership of eight albums featuring Gaughan’s work, from his 1972 debut album No More Forever to 1995’s Clan Alba, a LP by a folk supergroup, including Patsy Seddon and Brian McNeill, which Gaughan led and produced. None are available to stream. All have been unavailable on CD for decades, except Clan Alba, which can currently be bought from Celtic Music Distribution on Amazon Marketplace for £32.

Despite initial contact in which they referred to unspecified “inaccuracies” in points put to them by the Guardian, Celtic Music did not respond to a list of detailed questions.

Gaughan is now living a quiet life in Edinburgh, partially sighted, and having retired from performing in 2016 after suffering an earlier stroke. The renewed interest in his work has moved him. “At the time, I did the gigs and the records without worrying too much about how it was received, because that was never my primary intention,” he says. “It’s been wonderful to realise all that actually meant something to so many people.” But, he adds, the battles with Celtic Music over the years have been “frustrating and very depressing”, and he says it’s not about the money.

Celtic Music is not listed on Companies House. Nor is Northworks, the publishing entity affiliated with Celtic Music, which claims 100% mechanical royalties (payments made whenever a song is sold physically, downloaded or streamed) to 61 of Gaughan’s works, and from whom Gaughan says he has never received a royalty statement. In July, emboldened by the interest in his music, Gaughan formally registered challenges to the companies’ claims to his publishing with the Performing Right Society (PRS): the contested works were frozen in September, the royalties held until the dispute is resolved and the rightful owner can be established.

On behalf of Gaughan, Harper also launched a GoFundMe campaign to help him raise £45,000 to cover legal fees to test Celtic Music’s claims: to date, the total has reached 90%, and supporters include Woody Guthrie’s daughter, Nora Guthrie, and multimillionaire music industry investor Merck Mercuriadis, who has also “made himself available to give generous advice and contacts”, says Harper.

If successful, the effects of Gaughan’s actions will be far-reaching in the folk world. Other artists who have made albums claimed but not yet reissued by Celtic Music include Nic Jones (whose performing career was cut short after a car accident in 1982), Martin Simpson, Barbara Dickson and Barry and Robin Dransfield. Celtic Music also won a case against Domino Records in 2018, blocking sales of a 2017 reissue of Lal and Mike Waterson’s critically acclaimed 1972 album, Bright Phoebus, put together after the death of Celtic Music’s founder, Dave Bulmer. In a press release after the court hearing, Celtic Music promised a “programme of rereleases”, which remains eagerly awaited seven years on. Bright Phoebus is currently unavailable on Amazon. “I’m delighted that Dick Gaughan is testing the legal grounds around the continued Celtic Music claiming and hoarding of so much music from the past that people care about,” says Marry Waterson, daughter of the late Lal.

The enthusiasm with which people have received the Dick Gaughan Legacy Project, however, gives Harper hope. He has already been able to give Gaughan a substantial amount of money from the Kickstarter campaign; “his first real earnings from music for years”, he says. “We’ve shown there’s an audience for Dick’s music, and so many people want to correct what I call this legacy gap in folk.”

Gaughan expresses his feelings more simply, with his trademark, gentle power. “I never wanted to sing into a vacuum. I wanted to sing my songs to real human beings who are listening.”",2025-11-19 00:00:00,literal,Factual reporting on policy and elections,literal,literal,0,figurative,0.40780205,0.59219795,0.59219795,False

Viola Ford Fletcher, one of the last survivors of Oklahoma’s 1921 Tulsa Massacre, has died at age 111.

Despite her advanced age, Fletcher was a well-known activist thanks to her work trying to win justice for the victims of one of the worst episodes of racial violence in United States history.

“Today, our city mourns the loss of Mother Viola Fletcher. She was a survivor of one of the darkest chapters in our city’s history and endured more than anyone should,” Tulsa Mayor Monroe Nichols wrote in a Facebook post. “Mother Fletcher carried 111 years of truth, resilience, and grace and was a reminder of how far we’ve come and how far we must still go.”

Fletcher was seven years old at the time of the Tulsa Massacre in Oklahoma, a state living under the Jim Crow system that segregated the US South from the end of the 1800s until the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s.

The massacre began on May 31, 1921, when police arrested 19-year-old Dick Rowland, a Black shoeshiner, over allegations that he had assaulted a white woman, according to a report by the US Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division.

Michelle and I are grateful for her lifelong work to advance civil rights, and send our love to her family. https://t.co/km7RXnDKcW — Barack Obama (@BarackObama) November 25, 2025

When a group of white men gathered at the courthouse calling for Rowland to be lynched, a group of Black men from a nearby community responded and tried to protect him before “all hell broke out”, the report said.

Over the next two days, vigilante groups and law enforcement looted and burned down 35 blocks of Tulsa’s Greenwood District, which was then home to one of the wealthiest Black communities in the US. The Bureau of Labour Statistics in 2024 estimated that the scale of the damage was around $32.2m when adjusted for inflation.

As many as 300 residents of Tulsa were killed and another 700 injured, the report said, although the final tally is unknown because many were buried in unmarked graves.

Survivors like Fletcher and her family were forced to leave the area. Left destitute, her family became sharecroppers, a form of subsistence work where farmers give over almost all their harvest to their landlord.

Rowland was never charged, after Sarah Page, the lift operator he was accused of assaulting, said that she did not want to prosecute the case.

Despite the scale of devastation, the Tulsa Massacre received limited national attention until Oklahoma state launched an investigative commission in 1997. Efforts to win compensation for victims in 2001, however, failed due to the statute of limitations.

On the centennial anniversary of the massacre, Fletcher testified before the US Congress in 2021 about her experiences and co-authored a memoir, Don’t Let Them Bury My Story, with her grandson in 2023.

Fletcher was mourned by US leaders like former President Barack Obama.

Travis Turner, the 46-year-old head coach of the Union High School Bears from Big Stone Gap, went missing on Thursday, according to a Virginia State Police posting.

The 6-foot-3, 260-pound man was last seen in Wise County, in the far southwest corner of the commonwealth, wearing a gray sweatshirt, sweatpants and glasses, police said.

Search teams, with the help of dogs and drones, were concentrating efforts Monday around the town of Appalachia, where Turner lives, state police spokesperson Matthew Demlien said.

""Virginia State Police has utilized a number of assets"" to ""hopefully locate Turner safely,"" Demlien added.

Agents of the VSP's Bureau of Criminal Investigation, based out of Wytheville, had been sent to Turner’s residence in Appalachia on Thursday as ""part of the investigation,"" Demlien said.

The agency spokesperson stressed that last week's visit was not aimed at arresting Turner, but he did not elaborate.

""While in transit, the agents were informed that Turner was no longer at the location,"" Demlein said.

Turner's disappearance came two days before his Bears defeated the Graham H.S. G-Men, 12-0, to advance in the Class 2 playoffs.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/oct/27/jack-dejohnette-was-more-than-a-jazz-drummer-his-staggering-range-made-him-a-superhuman-force-in-music,Jack DeJohnette was more than a jazz drummer – his staggering range made him a superhuman force in music,"My interview with Jack DeJohnette didn’t start well. It was the summer of 2000 and DeJohnette was in London to play with Keith Jarrett’s Standards Trio. Referring to him in my first question as a “drummer” felt reasonable enough, but DeJohnette didn’t appreciate being pigeonholed and shot back instantly: “I’m a complete musician.” A few days later, sitting in the Royal Festival Hall watching the Standards Trio, a moment of transcendent magic thrilled me as Jarrett sustained a long sequence of repeated notes high up on the piano and DeJohnette powered the music forwards with a labyrinthian drum solo as harmonically searching as anything Jarrett had played. Complete musician indeed.

“The idea of improvisation,” DeJohnette told me, “is tied up in the very nature of our existence. We don’t expect our life to evolve without changing and we never know what’s round the corner – why should music be any different?” He further explained that each part of his drum kit he considered to be a musical being “in its own right”. He designed and tuned his cymbals to his own specification. Mix the sound of cymbals with the drums and then “you think harmonically on the kit,” he added. The sounds inside DeJohnette’s head could never be contained by the conventions of drum technique. He was also a pianist of considerable merit – who released a solo piano album, Return, in 2016 – and every facet of his musicianship seemed to be on display all of the time, until his death this week aged 83.

Many drummers tune their kit to a bespoke design, but DeJohnette’s playing exhibited a life-force that was entirely his own. To hear him play on What I Say from Miles Davis’s album Live-Evil is to marvel at apparently superhuman drive as he maintained an impactful funk/rock beat for 20 minutes. DeJohnette, who also played on Davis’s epoch-defining Bitches Brew, had by 1970 become the trumpeter’s drummer of choice in a meeting of mighty musical minds. His drums rooted What I Say deep in the Earth and allowed Davis, and subsequently saxophonist Gary Bartz, all the space they needed to explore, while DeJohnette packed his playing with rattling rhythmic asides – keeping a continual discussion with the other musicians.

His own 1968 debut album, The DeJohnette Complex, immediately proposed that his was a voice intimately connected with a jazz scene exploding in a thousand directions around him, while he remained doggedly independent. The compositions DeJohnette wrote for his album were harmonically ornate and asserted jazz/rock energy while also occasionally leaning towards free-form improvisation. He featured himself playing melodica, and his folky melodic inventions soared.

The DeJohnette Complex demonstrated that DeJohnette’s aesthetic was indeed delightfully complex and, after leaving Davis, he was signed to ECM Records. In 1976 he released Untitled, a hectic quintet album, but also Pictures in which he played piano, drums and organ, and duetted on some tracks with guitarist John Abercrombie, an album that was sparse and bare-bones in contrast to Untitled.

His 1981 ECM album with saxophonist John Surman, The Amazing Adventures of Simon Simon, became a landmark moment for both musicians, and a much-loved classic too. Surman and DeJohnette played their usual instruments while also doubling on keyboards and synthesisers, subsuming their own identities inside lavishly orchestrated soundscapes of pastoral tones. Another essential album was Oneness, recorded in 1997, which dealt up large-scale structures with pieces such as Free Above Sea and Priestesses of the Mist, their titles mirroring the elemental force unleashed by the music. Listening to that album around the time of its release, I was reminded of an earlier encounter with DeJohnette, when I heard his group Special Edition play in Leeds during the late 1980s. This performance was in no hurry to stake out its terrain, as ambient, slow-burn forms gradually telescoped towards rhythmic blows.

Talking to DeJohnette all those years later, these ideas of stress-testing form and scale made more sense. He told me how he loved playing those funk figurations with Davis because “I could sit in grooves and let them saturate me”, but also spoke of his desire to generate more wide-angled musical soundscapes, always open-ended and therefore healthy for the brain. He complained about the “safe confines” of pop music with its repetitive patterns. “With improvisation, though,” he said, “you’re open to a full range of possibilities.

The sun was ruthless, but the music was light. On the way home from work, I stepped into my neighborhood corner store, grabbed a bag of chips and something cold to drink. As I sipped a Cherry Coke ICEE, ""Diet Pepsi"" hummed in my headphones. Until that moment, Addison Rae's appeal eluded me: another TikTokker with a record deal. Suddenly, the syrupy sweet slushee clinked proverbial glasses with the pop song's uncomplicated-yet-satisfying elixir. And something clicked. Oh, this is what roséwave was built upon: simple pleasures in the summer.

Roséwave, for those not privy to its basic charms, is a series that we started in 2017 that celebrates a summer-y, feel-good lifestyle. There is truly a roséwave playlist for any occasion: swiping on the apps, catching the poolboy's eye, the summer getaway, poolside vibes, crying. It's always been meant as a hit-play-and-chill escape — even if just momentary — with a little something for everyone.

NBC News Think,https://www.nbcnews.com/world/asia/woman-found-alive-coffin-brought-cremation-thailand-rcna245779,Woman found alive in coffin after being brought in for cremation in Thailand,"BANGKOK — A woman in Thailand shocked temple staff when she started moving in her coffin after being brought in for cremation.

Wat Rat Prakhong Tham, a Buddhist temple in the province of Nonthaburi on the outskirts of Bangkok, posted a video on its Facebook page, showing a woman lying in a white coffin in the back of a pickup truck, slightly moving her arms and head, leaving temple staff bewildered.

Pairat Soodthoop, the temple’s general and financial affairs manager, told The Associated Press on Monday that the 65-year-old woman’s brother drove her from the province of Phitsanulok to be cremated.

He said they heard a faint knock coming from the coffin.

“I was a bit surprised, so I asked them to open the coffin, and everyone was startled,” he said. “I saw her opening her eyes slightly and knocking on the side of the coffin. She must have been knocking for quite some time.”

According to Pairat, the brother said his sister had been bedridden for about two years, when her health deteriorated and she became unresponsive, appearing to stop breathing two days ago. The brother then placed her in a coffin and made the 300-mile journey to a hospital in Bangkok, to which the woman had previously expressed a wish to donate her organs.

The hospital refused to accept the brother’s offer as he didn’t have an official death certificate, Pairat said. His temple offers a free cremation service, which is why the brother approached them Sunday, but was also refused because of the missing document.

The temple manager said that while he was explaining how to get a death certificate when they heard the knocking. They then assessed her and sent her to a nearby hospital.

The abbot said the temple would cover her medical expenses, according to Pairat.",2025-11-25 03:49:48.157000+00:00,literal,Straightforward news about reporting,literal,literal,0,literal,0.9149221,0.08507791,0.9149221,True
The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/24/war-on-terror-venezuela-donald-trump#comments,The US ‘war on terror’ has killed millions. Now Trump is bringing it to Venezuela,"For the last two months, US forces have amassed outside Venezuela and carried out a series of lethal strikes on civilian boats. The Trump White House has ordered these actions in the name of fighting “narco-terrorists” – a label apparently applicable to anyone suspected of participating in drug trafficking near Latin American coastlines. More than 80 people have already been killed in these pre-emptive strikes, and war hawks are calling for expanded military action to depose the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro.

Watching this play out, I am reminded of a passage from the geographer Stuart Elden’s award-winning 2009 book, Terror and Territory. In discussing how to study the “war on terror”, Elden observed that it did not make sense to study terrorism as something unique to non-state actors.

“States clearly operate in ways that terrify,” Elden said. “The terrorism of non-state actors is a very small proportion of terrorism taken as a whole, with states having killed far more than those who oppose them.”

A large body of research supports this claim.

Researchers with Brown University’s Costs of War project, for example, have found that US-led interventions in the “war on terror” from 2001 to 2023 killed over 400,000 civilians in direct war violence. They also show evidence that when considering indirect deaths – for example, people in war zones dying from treatable medical conditions after clean water or medical infrastructure was destroyed – death toll estimates rise to at least 3.5m. Moreover, even beyond direct war zones, a recent study in the Lancet found that sanctions during the same period were also extremely deadly, causing as many as 500,000 excess deaths per year from 2010 to 2021.

We have already spent decades terrorizing civilian populations around the world in the name of fighting terror

In short, we have already spent decades terrorizing civilian populations around the world in the name of fighting terror. This is well known, and yet the Trump White House is reinvigorating the “war on terror” anyway. Still more, it is trying to do it with even less oversight on the president’s license to kill than has been exercised in the past.

While on the surface Trump’s second term has been characterized by a disorienting barrage of executive orders and culture war polemics, the administration has in fact been running a cohesive authoritarian playbook aimed at conferring near limitless powers to the presidency. These concerted efforts have played out in numerous policy arenas from immigration, to higher education, to economics, to even determining who is a citizen.

Consistent with this pattern, Trump is asserting the same unchecked authority over the violent capacities of the US military.

As I have written previously, a key tactic of the Trump White House has been eviscerating the oversight of the courts, making it impossible to impede the executive branch from continuing to break the law, even when it gets caught red-handed. However, another frequent strategy – perhaps less visible, though equally anathema to a system of limited government – has been to simply sidestep oversight by asserting that, even when law in theory places limits on presidential power, the exercise of this power is still “unquestioned”; according to this thinking, the executive branch apparently has the prerogative to interpret what those limits are.

Of course, in a serious constitutional system, this would be preposterous. In practice, there would be no limits to presidential powers, rendering the constitution moot. Nonetheless, this is exactly the type of power that Trump is asserting over the military, both at home and abroad.

The court case related to Trump’s efforts to suppress protests in Chicago using troops sheds critical light on how this strategy works. Federal law allows a president to deploy troops domestically if there is a “rebellion” that is making it impossible to “execute the laws of the United States”. Accordingly, some lower court judges have reasonably blocked the deployment of troops, finding that the administration has been unable to prove that these conditions were met. Just look at the facts: protests had on average only been about 50 people at a time, and they have clearly not made law enforcement impossible since ICE – the federal agency being protested – has vastly increased arrests during this time.

True to form, however, Trump’s lawyers have argued that these details are irrelevant. In their view, there is actually no need to prove a rebellion is happening because the president has the authority to define rebellion anyway. In other words, the law might impose limits on how the president can use the military, but the president gets to decide what those limits are.

While lower courts have so far prevented this nakedly authoritarian legal theory from taking hold, the argument itself is still massively consequential: first, because an extremely Trump-friendly supreme court will hear the case soon and could very well endorse these claims; and second, because this is essentially the same logic that the Trump administration has used to justify killing civilians off the Latin American coast. Indeed, just as the Trump administration is asserting the exclusive right to define “rebellion” regardless of the facts on the ground – thus eliminating any real limits on the power to deploy troops domestically – the Trump White House is similarly asserting the unencumbered right to define “terrorist”, along with the corresponding right to take deadly action with virtually no outside oversight.

In public statements, Trump has defended treating drug smugglers as terrorists by citing the harm done by drug overdoses, in effect suggesting that drug traffickers are directly killing US citizens. Ignoring the fact that Venezuela doesn’t produce fentanyl, the main driver of overdoses in the US, Trump has even gone so far as to float the mathematically impossible claim that each boat strike has saved 25,000 lives. Of course, officials have provided zero public evidence that the boats attacked were carrying drugs at all, much less tried to explain how blowing up boats would have any impact at all on drug abuse in the US.

But again, why would they? The whole point of the argument is that such facts don’t matter because Trump simply has the unchecked authority to use lethal force. In fact, the justice department has suggested that officials do not even have to publicly list which foreign organizations are classified as killable terrorists, much less provide evidence to support this designation.

Ultimately, Trump’s actions in and around Venezuela are best understood as a new phase in the “war on terror” – an ongoing tragedy that has already had deadly consequences for millions – though now with even fewer guardrails. The bottom line: Venezuela is not just some chess piece in an abstract game of geopolitics, and we are doing a disservice to humanity if we let war hawks in government and media spin it this way. We are talking about real people, and as very recent history shows, countless lives are at stake.",2025-11-24 00:00:00,literal,Factual reporting on reporting and data,literal,literal,0,literal,0.7785663,0.22143371,0.7785663,True
NBC News Think,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/black-mothers-texas-indiana-say-hospital-staff-ignored-cries-care-labo-rcna245068,Black mothers in Texas and Indiana say hospital staff ignored cries for care while they were in labor,"Two Black women said they were denied immediate medical attention despite being minutes away from giving birth.

The incidents, which happened days apart in different states, highlight long-standing disparities in health outcomes for Black women, health experts say.

In a TikTok video that has gone viral, Texas resident Karrie Jones can be seen screaming while a nurse at Dallas Regional Medical Center in Mesquite asks a series of intake questions, including her due date.

“Right now,” Jones yells as she writhes in pain in a wheelchair.

Jones’ mother, who took the video on Nov. 11, can be heard asking the nurse whether she treats all patients in the same manner “or just the Black ones.” The nurse does not respond.

In another video posted online, her mother says she asked hospital staff members whether they could move Jones into labor and delivery, as she was in visible distress. “She said no, I have to fill out all this paperwork.”

Jones' family say they waited more than half an hour before she was admitted. Jones’ mother declined to comment at this time.

'It's hurtful'

Less than a week later in Crown Point, Indiana, Mercedes Wells rushed to Franciscan Hospital when her contractions were 10 minutes apart, she told NBC News.

Familiar with labor pains as a mother with three kids waiting at home in Illinois, Wells knew the contractions meant her fourth baby could arrive soon.

After six hours and a checkup from the nurse, Wells said, she was sent home without ever having seen a doctor.

“They didn’t give me a chance, give my husband a chance, to warm up the truck,” she said.

Her husband, Leon, recounted that while he was driving, “I actually see the baby’s head. I see the baby’s head right there. I’m like, Oh, my gosh. I pull over.”

Eight minutes after Wells and her husband got into their truck, Wells gave birth while they were parked on the side of the road.

“It was really a horrific situation to be treated like a dog, or not even like a dog, like less than,” Wells said.

""It says that they don’t care at all for Black women in health, and it’s hurtful,"" she said later. ""We thought that, you know, things have changed at this point in our country, and I don’t see a change.""

Her husband said he worried he could lose both wife and child in labor.

“The 'what ifs' kind of gets me messed up as a man and as a protective, as a husband,"" he said. “It was very hard to see my wife go through the situation.”

In a statement, Dallas Regional Medical Center said, in part, that it prioritizes “the safety, dignity, and well-being of our patients.”

On Friday, Franciscan Health Crown Point issued a formal apology to Wells, which was shared with NBC News. The hospital also confirmed that the nurse and doctor involved in the incident are no longer employed by the hospital.

“We failed to listen to Mrs. Wells’ concerns,” CEO Raymond Grady said in the statement. “We must fix what failed in our hospital so that no one experiences what happened to Mercedes Wells.”

Grady added that new policies are being implemented at the hospital in response to the incident, including mandatory cultural competency training for all labor and delivery staff. All pregnant patients in the labor and delivery unit must be examined by a physician before they leave the hospital.

""Compassionate concern is absent when a caregiver fails to listen to a patient who is clearly in pain and vulnerable,"" Grady said. ""The video was difficult to watch.""

Maternal mortality disparities

The maternal mortality rate for Black women in the United States is significantly higher than for other racial groups. Black women are three times likelier to die from childbirth than white women, with 50 deaths per 100,000 live births, compared with 14.5 deaths for white women, 12 deaths for Latinas and 10 for Asian women, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Black babies are likelier to die and to be born prematurely, which could contribute to health issues later in life, according to the CDC.

“That’s one of the starkest disparities in all of medicine, and most of these deaths are preventable. Delayed care — exactly what we saw in the videos — is one of the biggest contributors. And so for me, this isn’t an isolated moment,” said Dr. Joel Bervell, a physician and social media personality who spoke out about the videos.

“It’s impossible to ignore the statistics that back up that Black women are treated differently in the health care system,” he added.

Under a 1986 law called the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, staff members in emergency departments must stabilize patients who appear to be in active labor. But the definition of active labor can be subjective, said legal analyst Angela Cenedella, a lawyer who is not representing Jones or Wells. A patient can be turned away if a medical professional decides labor is not imminent.

“In those cases, if things do just change rapidly and a baby does come out faster than expected, that’s not necessarily a liability of the hospital. ... That’s really where the subjectivity exists,” she said, adding that if hospital staff members are negligent in decision-making “and don’t make decisions based on a reasonable standard of medical care, then there’s always a possibility for liability.”

'This should not happen to people'

U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly, D-Illinois, announced she will introduce legislation next week to prevent what happened to Wells from occurring again.

The Wells family has retained a lawyer, who has been in contact with hospital officials, NBC Chicago reported.

Texas lawmakers told NBC Dallas-Fort Worth they are meeting with hospital administrators about Jones' treatment.

""We will continue monitoring the investigation closely, maintain communication with hospital leadership, and work collaboratively to help restore trust and ensure that every person in our community receives fair and appropriate medical care,"" state Rep. Linda Garcia, a Democrat whose district includes part of Mesquite, said in a statement on social media.

While the incidents have now been seen by millions, the moments for Wells remain intimate and raw.

“I was actually watching [the Texas] video while in the labor and delivery room,” Wells said. “I didn’t think that it was about to happen to me.”

She added: “It shouldn’t happen to any woman. I don’t care race, ethnicity, anything, none of that should matter. This should not happen to people.”",2025-11-21 19:08:17.712000+00:00,metaphor,Crowning used as metaphor for achieving top position,metaphor,figurative,1,literal,0.72133005,0.27866998,0.72133005,False

NBC News Think,https://www.nbcnews.com/sports/nfl/christian-mccaffreys-big-night-leads-49ers-20-9-victory-panthers-rcna245784,Christian McCaffrey’s big night leads 49ers to 20-9 victory over Panthers,"SANTA CLARA, Calif. — Christian McCaffrey gained 142 yards from scrimmage and scored a touchdown in his first game against Carolina since he was traded away three years ago, leading the San Francisco 49ers to a 20-9 victory over the Panthers on Monday night.

McCaffrey’s big night helped the 49ers (8-4) overcome three interceptions in the first half by Brock Purdy to remain in playoff position headed into the stretch run of the season.

Bryce Young and the Panthers (6-6) struggled to take advantage of their opportunities a week after he threw for a franchise-record 448 yards in a win at Atlanta. Young threw for just 169 yards with one touchdown and one interception as Carolina missed a chance to move into sole possession of first place in the NFC South.

The 49ers went conservative in the second half after Purdy’s rough start to the game, relying mostly on McCaffrey and short passes. The strategy worked with McCaffrey scoring on a 12-yard run to make it 17-3 and the Niners adding a field goal by Matt Gay.

Young did connect on one big play, a 29-yard TD pass to Tetairoa McMillan, but Carolina couldn’t convert on 2-point try after a penalty moved the ball to the 1.

Young then threw his second interception of the game to Ji’Ayir Brown with Carolina in scoring position with a 20-9 deficit.

McCaffrey, who has transformed the 49ers’ offense since being acquired in October 2022, finished with 89 yards rushing and 53 receiving for his 10th 100-yard game of the season — two shy of the franchise record he set in 2023.

The 49ers gave the ball to McCaffrey on the first five plays of the game, leading to the first opening-drive TD of the season against Carolina. Purdy connected on a 12-yard pass to Jauan Jennings for the score.

The two offenses did nothing after that. Purdy became the first player to throw three interceptions — Jaycee Horn got two of them — in the first half all season, but the Panthers turned those into only three points. Young ruined one drive when he was intercepted by Brown on a first-down play from the 1.

The teams traded field goals and the Niners led 10-3 at the half.",2025-11-25 04:18:37.424000+00:00,literal,Straightforward news reporting,literal,literal,0,literal,0.967341,0.03265903,0.967341,True
Al Jazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/11/23/a-corruption-scandal-may-well-end-the-war-in-ukraine,A corruption scandal may well end the war in Ukraine,"On November 10, the Ukrainian anticorruption authorities revealed that close associates of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy were allegedly involved in a scheme to embezzle $100m from Ukraine’s energy sector.

Zelenskyy’s business partner Tymur Mindich as well as two government ministers have been named so far in the investigation, led by the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU), an agency backed by Western governments. Ukrainian and Western media have suggested that the president’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, may also be implicated.

The way the investigation is revealing facts and identifying suspects – slowly, theatrically, strategically – smacks of a political campaign aimed at achieving specific political outcomes under the cover of an anticorruption drive.

The scandal has delivered a devastating blow to Zelenskyy’s international reputation and to the Ukrainian cause at large. The Ukrainian president is emerging out of it as a lame duck who will do what he is told by whoever is pulling the strings, which may be the administration of United States President Donald Trump.

One area in which there is already dramatic change is Ukrainian policy on talks with Russia. On November 11, British newspaper The Times ran a story on Deputy Foreign Minister Sergiy Kyslytsya, the man tasked with leading the negotiations, in which he made clear that engagement with Moscow was suspended because it was yielding no result. Just a week later, Zelenskyy announced he wanted to reactivate talks with Russia.

Then immediately, talk began of an emerging American peace plan that envisages Ukraine succumbing to all the key Russian demands for ending the war, if we are to believe media leaks. Despite a couple of defiant statements by Ukrainian officials, Zelenskyy didn’t reject it outright and promised to cooperate with the US. The corruption scandal has drastically limited his room for defiance.

What makes the prospect of peace more realistic today is that there is now a clear scapegoat for what essentially is Ukraine’s looming defeat – the Ukrainian president himself.

Indeed, the talks spearheaded by Trump earlier this year did not progress primarily because nobody wanted to take responsibility for an outcome that contrasts drastically with the expectations the cheerleaders of this war had built. While a military defeat today may mean salvation for Kyiv, it would be a deadly blow for war-mongering politicians and lobbyists who promoted the idea that Russia, a major nuclear power, could be coerced into accepting Western primacy by force.

That illusion underpinned the entire Western policy with regards to Russia throughout the conflict. It is the main reason why Kyiv resisted accepting an outcome of the war that the West was unable to change.

It has long been clear that Ukraine’s Western allies have hit a wall when it comes to military supplies and funding for Ukraine and sanctions against Russia. Nineteen packages of harsh sanctions against Moscow have failed to stop its army, which has grown only stronger and far more technologically advanced than it was at the start of the conflict.

Meanwhile, Ukraine has been struggling with draft dodging and territorial and human losses. It could reportedly run out of Western funding by April. Worse still, close European allies – like Poland and Germany – have indicated they are not ready to keep funding the large numbers of Ukrainian refugees they are hosting.

The appetite for more war with Russia is largely exhausted in Europe, but of course, no one wants to be blamed for reaching a much worse settlement than could have been achieved had this all-out war been avoided altogether.

Being blamed for a Ukraine defeat is not a huge risk for Trump, who has long dismissed this conflict as “Biden’s war”, accusing his predecessor President Joe Biden of starting it.

It is much harder for European leaders and Zelenskyy himself to accept it, given how invested they have been in the promise that Russia could be defeated on the battlefield.

To understand their predicament today, one needs to recall December 2019 when Zelenskyy met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Paris, and the two sides agreed on a ceasefire in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region, which ended hostilities and froze the front line over the next 12 months.

The war could have ended then on terms Kyiv could only dream of today. In particular, Ukraine would have retained its formal sovereignty over the Donbas region, only a part of which would have become a Russian-influenced autonomy. Ukraine would have lost the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia occupied and annexed in 2014.

But with the arrival of Biden to the White House in January 2021, Zelenskyy made a U-turn on the peace process, embarking on a strategy of pressing Russia on all fronts to coerce it into agreeing to better conditions for Kyiv.

He clamped down on Putin’s main political ally in Ukraine and launched a loud campaign for Ukraine’s accession to NATO while his Western allies tried to pressure Germany into stopping work on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, a major Russian export energy project. London also challenged Moscow by sending a battleship into the waters off Crimea, which Russia considers its territory. More than a year of dangerous brinkmanship ended with Putin unleashing an all-out invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

This year, Ukraine finally ditched its rightful but entirely unrealistic demands for a full Russian withdrawal and reparations in favour of a comprehensive ceasefire along the current front lines. It did so after having lost swaths of territory, a lot of infrastructure, 14,500 civilians and up to 100,000 military personnel.

A peace agreement on Russia’s terms would be extremely unfair to Ukraine and would indeed be against international law. But the only alternative to it is the country being sucked even deeper into the black hole of devastation and collapsing nationhood.

The reaction to the draft of the peace plan was the expected mix of virtue signalling, performative defiance and jingoism. It reflects the complete absence of a realistic plan that could improve Ukraine’s negotiating position. Conveniently though, the corruption within Zelenskyy’s entourage gives pro-Ukrainian cheerleaders in the West a way out that absolves them from responsibility for the deadly mess they helped create.

Al Jazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/11/16/israel-cant-fly-us-all-out-to-south-africa,Israel can’t fly us all out to South Africa,"Earlier this week, a flight carrying 153 Palestinians from Gaza landed in South Africa without documentation. The passengers were stuck on the plane for 12 hours before the South African authorities, who claimed they had not been informed by Israelis about the deportation flight, allowed them to disembark on humanitarian grounds.

The Palestinians on board had paid between $1,500 and $5,000 to a company called Al-Majd Europe to leave Gaza. The operation is run by a few Palestinians on the ground in coordination with the Israeli occupation authorities. At least two other such flights had already been made since June this year.

This is the latest scheme Israel is deploying to depopulate Gaza – a longstanding goal of its apartheid regime that goes back to the early 20th century.

Since the beginning of the Zionist movement, Palestinians have been perceived as a demographic obstacle to establishing a Jewish state. In the late 19th century, Theodor Herzl, one of the founding fathers of Zionism, wrote that the displacement of Arabs from Palestine must be part of the Zionist plan, suggesting that poor populations could be moved across borders and deprived of employment opportunities in a quiet and cautious manner.

In 1938, David Ben-Gurion, a key Zionist leader who would later become Israel’s first prime minister, made clear he supported forced “relocation” and saw nothing “immoral” in it. Part of this vision was carried out 10 years later during the Nakba of 1948, when more than 700,000 Palestinians were forced out of their homes in what Israeli historian Benny Morris has called “necessary” ethnic cleansing.

After 1948, Israel continued efforts to displace Palestinians. In the 1950s, tens of thousands of Palestinians and Palestinian Bedouins were forcibly transferred from the Naqab (Negev) desert to the Sinai Peninsula or Gaza, which was under Egyptian administration at that time.

After the June 1967 war, when Israel occupied Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem, it adopted a strategy of what it called “voluntary migration”. The idea was to create harsh living conditions to pressure residents to leave, including demolishing homes and reducing employment opportunities.

In parallel, “emigration offices” were established in the refugee camps of Gaza to encourage people who have lost any hope of return to their homes to leave in exchange for money and travel arrangements. Israel also encouraged Palestinians to go work abroad, especially in the Gulf. The price Palestinians had to pay for leaving was never being allowed to come back.

After October 7, 2023, Israel saw another chance to carry out its plan of ethnically cleansing Gaza – this time through genocide and forced expulsion. It thought it had the necessary international sympathy and diplomatic capital to carry out such an atrocity, as statements by various Israeli officials, such as ministers Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, show. They even came up with the so-called “General’s Plan” to fully depopulate northern Gaza.

The new scheme for forcing Palestinians out of Gaza fits well into this historical pattern. What distinguishes it, however, is that Palestinians are made to pay for their own forced displacement and their desperation is exploited by Palestinian collaborators who seek to make easy profit. This, of course, is meant to further the financial depletion of the Palestinian population and create more internal fissures and tensions.

This scheme, like previous ones, also has the central feature of denying Palestinians return. None of the passengers on the plane received Israeli exit stamps on their passports, which was the reason the South African authorities struggled with the admission process. Having no legal record of leaving the Israeli-occupied territory of Gaza means these people are automatically classified as illegal migrants and have no possibility of returning.

It is important here to clarify why Israel is allowing these flights to take place while impeding the evacuation of ill and injured Palestinians and students accepted in foreign universities. These exits of patients and students would be legal, and they imply the right to return – something Israel does not want to allow.

That there are Palestinians willing to fall for this flight scheme is unsurprising. Two years of genocide have driven the people of Gaza to unimaginable desperation. There are that many Gaza residents who would willingly board those planes. And yet, Israel cannot fly us all to South Africa.

Through decades of Zionist occupation, Palestinians have persevered. Palestinian steadfastness in the face of wars, sieges, home raids, demolitions, land theft, and economic subjugation confirms that the Palestinian land is not merely a place to live, but a symbol of identity and history that people are not willing to give up.

In the past two years, Israel has destroyed the lives and homes of two million Palestinians. And even that has failed to kill the Palestinian spirit and drive to hold onto the Palestinian land. The Palestinians are not flying out; we are here to stay.

NPR,https://www.npr.org/about-npr/1205385162/special-section-generative-artificial-intelligence,Special Section: Generative Artificial Intelligence,"Special Section: Generative Artificial Intelligence

What audiences see and hear from NPR has always been, and always will be, the product of human beings. NPR has also always been a leader in finding creative uses for new technology. If used thoughtfully, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) is a tool that may be able to help us fulfill our mission as journalists, become more efficient in our work, and possibly help free staff up to do things that are more creative and critical to advancing our journalism.

Guideline: You are responsible for the content you create, with or without the use of GAI.

Plagiarism and accuracy are major concerns with GAI which scrapes the Internet for information and material, and uses that material to generate seemingly new products. We should always assume that what GAI comes up with is not original, and we don't know to what extent it is simply plagiarizing. If you use GAI to help you with your work, you are ultimately responsible for the content of that work and that includes making sure you are not plagiarizing. We must also check to ensure that the information GAI delivers is accurate and reliably sourced. We cannot assume that the information it delivers is correct.

As technology evolves our use of it will evolve as well, but our use will always be within the framework of the standards that guide all of our journalism.

Guideline: Don't rely on GAI to include all angles of a story.

GAI doesn't know what it doesn't know. As journalists we constantly question our assumptions, one of the most important being: Have we included all of the viewpoints and aspects of the story we are covering? We have a responsibility to make sure we are looking at every issue from multiple viewpoints. If you are using GAI as a reporting tool it may well miss important aspects of a story. It's important that you be aware of that potential shortcoming throughout any reporting process that includes the use of GAI.

Guideline: GAI can't check its own biases, that's your job.

GAI has no sense of ethics or morals. Those must come from you; the user and you will be expected to ensure that anything you produce using GAI conforms to the standards laid out in this handbook.

GAI may seem autonomous, but it is the product of human beings. As such, it shares and can exacerbate the biases of those who created and programmed it as well as the biases of the material that was used to train it. As we use it we must be on the lookout for those biases just as we always must look out for our own biases, those of our sources and those of our colleagues.

Guideline: If GAI played a significant role in your reporting you should share that fact with your audience.

As the main transparency section of this handbook says, ""We reveal as much as we practically can about how we discover and verify the facts we present."" As we do with the other aspects of our journalism, if GAI plays a significant role in the reporting of a story we should reveal that fact to our audience. If you're not sure whether your use of GAI was significant enough to include in your story, discuss it with your editor, a Managing Editor, or the ME for Standards and Practices.

Guideline: We must protect our own work.

Because GAI systems learn from data, they may take anything we put into them and add it to their knowledge base. As a result, no NPR employee should ever put any of NPR's intellectual property into any GAI system without NPR's prior consent. NPR's intellectual property includes everything you have created in the process of your work — from your notes, to your draft of a story, to memos about coverage ideas.

Also, keep in mind that, under current law, material produced by GAI cannot be copyrighted. While the courts have yet to clarify exactly how much human input is needed, there must be some human-generated content for something to be copyrightable. Facts themselves are not copyrightable and the human content needs to be creative — more than simply adding facts to something that was on AI. NPR has an interest in ensuring that content we create is copyrightable, so if you wish to use GAI to create content, please consult the OGC (Office of General Counsel) first to determine how NPR can best protect its interests in such instances.

Guideline: GAI when used correctly can help us be better journalists.

GAI does, however, open up a whole realm of possibilities. It is a great tool for some tasks that are ""hard to do but easy to verify,"" such as finding patterns in statistics or finding synonyms. In these early days, we are asking those who use GAI to help in editorial work to get prior approval from the Managing Editor for Standards and Practices. As we work with it, we will become more familiar with what it can and cannot be used for. Our review policies will likely change, as will this guidance.

There will no doubt be other media that attempt to use GAI to generate content. We may soon see a two-tiered media landscape with some media trying to use GAI to replace humans. Other media, including NPR, are choosing to keep humans firmly in control. Keeping that control will mean we are upholding our journalistic standards even as we find ways of incorporating GAI into our work.",2025-11-24,literal,Factual reporting on data and policy,literal,literal,0,literal,0.95506215,0.04493779,0.95506215,True
NBC News Think,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/defense-department-investigation-sen-mark-kelly-rcna245675,Defense Department says it's opening an investigation into Sen. Mark Kelly,"The Defense Department said Monday that it is opening an investigation into Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, a retired Navy captain, in connection with a video he and other Democrats recorded urging members of the military and the intelligence community not to comply with illegal orders from President Donald Trump’s administration.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said on X that the video, which set off a political firestorm last week, was ""despicable, reckless, and false.""

""Five of the six individuals in that video do not fall under @DeptofWar jurisdiction (one is CIA and four are former military but not ‘retired’, so they are no longer subject to UCMJ). However, Mark Kelly (retired Navy Commander) is still subject to UCMJ—and he knows that,"" he added, referring to the Uniform Code of Military Justice.

A thorough review of allegations has been initiated to determine further actions, which could include recalling Kelly to active duty for court-martial proceedings or administrative measures, the Defense Department said.

Kelly, who spent more than two decades in the Navy as a pilot and retired as a captain, said on X that Hegseth's post was the first he had heard of the investigation.

""If this is meant to intimidate me and other members of Congress from doing our jobs and holding this administration accountable, it won’t work,"" he said. ""I’ve given too much to this country to be silenced by bullies who care more about their own power than protecting the Constitution.""

Kelly’s fellow Arizona senator, Ruben Gallego, wrote on X that Kelly ""has dedicated his life to serving this country with honor. And now Trump is coming after him with the same baseless garbage he throws at anyone who refuses to bend the knee. Mark told the truth — in America, we swear an oath to the Constitution, not wannabe kings.""

""F--- you and your investigation,"" added Gallego, a Democrat and veteran of the Marines.

Trump said last week on Truth Social that the Democratic lawmakers “should be arrested and put on trial,” accusing them of “seditious behavior” that, he said, could be “punishable by death.”

The next day, he said on conservative Brian Kilmeade's radio show that he was ""not threatening death"" toward the members.

“I think they’re in serious trouble. I would say they’re in serious trouble. I’m not threatening death, but I think they’re in serious trouble,"" Trump said. ""In the old days, it was death. That was seditious behavior.""

The Democrats' video was posted online Tuesday as a direct appeal to members of the military and the intelligence community.

“This administration is pitting our uniformed military and intelligence community professionals against American citizens,"" the lawmakers said in the video. ""Like us, you all swore an oath to protect and defend this Constitution. Right now, the threats coming to our Constitution aren’t just coming from abroad but from right here at home. Our laws are clear. You can refuse illegal orders. You must refuse illegal orders. No one has to carry out orders that violate the law or our Constitution.”

In addition to Kelly, it featured Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan and Reps. Chris Deluzio of Pennsylvania, Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire, Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania and Jason Crow of Colorado. All are military veterans and former intelligence officials.

Kelly is the only lawmaker in the group who retired from the military. That means he can be recalled for an urgent need like a war or a national emergency but also to face court-martial for misconduct.

As part of the Pentagon's investigation, if the facts support charges, Kelly’s commander would notify him of them. It’s not clear yet who Kelly’s commander would be. Kelly would then sign a charge sheet and be recalled to active duty to possibly face a court-martial. The Convening Authority, which is similar to a judge, could then refer the case to court-martial — the equivalent of an indictment in a civilian court.

The likeliest charges that would be pursued are basically a catch-all: Article 133 Conduct Unbecoming an Officer and Article 134 Conduct Prejudicial to Good Order and Discipline. If he were found guilty, Kelly could be knocked down to a rank lower than captain, his separation could be changed to dishonorable, he could lose his benefits, and he could serve jail time.

In social media posts Monday, Crow and Slotkin voiced their support for Kelly and bashed Trump.

“You can’t bully a patriot. I stand with @SenMarkKelly,” Crow wrote. “This is a decisive moment. Trump is trying to incite violence, intimidate, and punish those who speak up to hold him accountable.”

In her post, Slotkin wrote: “This is the President’s playbook: using intimidation, harassment, and the weight of the federal government to try and silence anyone who speaks up against him. That won’t stop Senator Kelly, or any of us, from standing up for what’s right.”

Slotkin has previously defended the group's original video, noting that the Uniform Code of Military Justice requires members of the military to disobey illegal orders.

""This is the law,"" she said last week in response to a post from White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller criticizing the Democrats. ""Passed down from our Founding Fathers, to ensure our military upholds its oath to the Constitution — not a king. Given you’re directing much of a military policy, you should buff up"" on the UCMJ.

Multiple lawmakers in the video have said they have faced threats following Trump's threats.

""I’ve been through dangerous situations before, so it doesn’t change my feeling about speaking my mind,"" Slotkin said Sunday in an interview ABC’s ""This Week."" ""But obviously, the president took issue with one sentence in a video and was calling for our death. I think that’s inappropriate, whether you’re a Democrat, Republican or an independent.""",2025-11-25 02:40:07.890000+00:00,both,"firestorm is metaphor for intense controversy; ironic quotes around ""despicable, reckless, and false."" with negative context",both,figurative,1,figurative,0.048498016,0.95150197,0.95150197,True
The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/15/todd-snider-country-music-dies-aged-59,"Todd Snider, alt-country singer-songwriter of Alright Guy, dies aged 59","Todd Snider, the influential alt-country singer-songwriter who created Americana hits such as Alright Guy, has died at 59.

His passing was shared through announcements on his official social media accounts. Although no cause of death was provided, his family shared on Friday that he had recently been hospitalized with pneumonia.

His record label posted a statement on social media, writing: “Aimless, Inc. Headquarters is heartbroken to share that our Founder, our Folk Hero, our Poet of the World, our Vice President of the Abrupt Change Dept., the Storyteller, our beloved Todd Daniel Snider has departed this world. Where do we find the words for the one who always had the right words, who knew how to distill everything down to its essence with words and song while delivering the most devastating, hilarious, and impactful turn of phrases?”

It continued: “He relayed so much tenderness and sensitivity through his songs, and showed many of us how to look at the world through a different lens. He got up every morning and started writing, always working towards finding his place among the songwriting giants that sat on his record shelves, those same giants who let him into their lives and took him under their wings, who he studied relentlessly. Guy Clark, John Prine, Kris Kristofferson, Jerry Jeff Walker.”

Snider had previously spoken openly about the chronic pain he endured because of spinal stenosis. Earlier this month, his team called off the remainder of his tour, reporting before a scheduled performance in Salt Lake City: “Todd sustained severe injuries as the victim of a violent assault outside of his hotel.”

Not long after, police said that Snider had been arrested for disorderly conduct. Body-camera footage circulated showing Snider telling officers he was in pain. When asked whether he was unhoused, he replied that he was “famous”, explaining that his band had left town after the show was canceled.

Salt Lake City police also told reporters they had no record of the assault described in the earlier press statement, according to Variety.

Born in Portland, Oregon, Snider headed to northern California after graduating high school, then drifted to Texas during the 1980s. There he crossed paths with Jerry Jeff Walker, who became an important mentor. By the 1990s, Snider had settled in Nashville, where he became a defining figure of the gritty east Nashville scene.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/nov/21/brandy-monica-concert-review-new-york,Brandy and Monica review – 90s R&B heavyweights bring star-studded reunion to New York,"Supposedly feuding for over 25 years might be bad karma, but it’s great for ticket sales. Of course, Brandy and Monica aren’t actually fighting, they just did such a good job of pretending to hate each other on their 1998 duet The Boy Is Mine that the world has been convinced of it ever since. The R&B legends have taken pains to point out that their relationship is harmonious in multiple interviews leading up to this 32-date co-headline tour, even making fun of the drama in a recent Dunkin advert that featured them fighting over a frappe.

Happily, Brandy and Monica’s sisterhood also means they’re playing their biggest venues in decades. After emerging on stage from a vintage elevator wearing sunglasses and scowling expressions, the duo launches into a kind of sing-and-dance-off, trading places and performing a trio of classics apiece as the other watches with disdain. It’s a knowing nod to their purported rivalry that begins to take on the feeling of a variety segment, which isn’t helped by the trimming of songs like What About Us? and Like This and Like That to 90 seconds apiece. Even so, their camaraderie shines through as Brandy quickly breaks character to sway and sing along to Monica’s Don’t Take It Personal (Just One Of Dem Days), a showcase for her slightly raspy, soulful vocals during which she winds her hips and aims gun fingers at the audience.

Brandy and Monica’s respective music shines brightest tonight in their solo sets. Brandy’s mid-tempo Full Moon is already impossible to sing by 99% of people, but she confirms her honorific as the “vocal Bible” by further complicating it tonight, adding in extra octave-scaling runs and ad-libs. She’s captivating in tightly choreographed performances of Afrodisiac and Who Is She 2 U, and a certified kook to boot, gently needling her co-headliner like a sassy sibling. After Monica delivers a heartfelt speech about how her partner has taught her that love can cross oceans, Brandy’s eyebrows shoot upwards and she quickly informs the audience: “She still can’t swim!”

It doesn’t seem that any live instruments were involved in tonight’s show, save for the organ that accompanies Brandy’s gorgeous rendition of the Never Say Never deep cut Put That on Everything. That doesn’t deter Monica, who adds a dash of Las Vegas camp to Street Symphony with shirtless male dancers and prop violins. The First Night is extended into a Diana Ross mashup that plays off the song’s Love Hangover sample, performed with hip-hop moves and a shiny cane. Razzle-dazzle isn’t always needed to pack a punch, though. Her pristine vocals fill the arena during a stripped-down, belting rendition of Angel of Mine, a tender love song with attitude and bite.

Other moments are more jarring. While there are minimal stage changes throughout the show, elaborate and strange video interludes punctuate the show’s six acts: one features Brandy and Monica as marionettes that get tied up together in a bundle of puppet strings, while others recap their chart achievements and memorable videos as if they’re an X Factor guest about to perform. As well as three opening acts (Kelly Rowland, Muni Long, and recent American Idol winner Jamal Roberts), tonight’s show also features a slightly perplexing array of special guests including Ciara, who performs a brilliantly athletic four-song medley, as well as Fat Joe, Tyrese and NYC cult rapper Max B. “If you got time, we got time,” beams Monica around three-quarters through the show, as Fabolous strides on to the stage to perform Into You. Ma’am, it is 11.30pm on a school night.

Soon, Brandy and Monica reunite on stage. In tribute to Whitney Houston, who mentored both artists, the pair duet on a fun, loose cover of I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me), before closing the show out with – what else? – The Boy Is Mine. On a stage filled with dry ice, the pair go all in on scenery-chewing, as Brandy tosses her hair and stamps her feet while Monica purses her lips and rolls her eyes. It’s been a strange couple of hours to get here, but the reward is a sing-off for the ages.",2025-11-21 00:00:00,literal,Straightforward news about official statements,literal,literal,0,figurative,0.00094329123,0.99905676,0.99905676,False
NBC News Think,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/x-new-location-transparency-feature-questions-origins-maga-accounts-rcna245487,X's new location transparency feature unleashes questions about origins of MAGA accounts,"A new feature on X has stirred confusion, anger and a wave of online sleuthing after users discovered that the platform was suddenly displaying the surprising locations where certain accounts are based.

Over the weekend, users noticed that clicking on an account’s join date now opens a tab that shows the country or region in which the account is located.

X’s head of product, Nikita Bier, teased the feature last month as a way to help users verify the authenticity of content they read and limit the influence of troll farms, which often run political accounts from outside the countries they target.

The issue of inauthentic or ""bot"" accounts has plagued the platform, formerly Twitter, and other social media sites for over a decade. Perhaps most notably, inauthentic accounts on Twitter and other social media platforms were allegedly used by a Russian government operation in the run-up to the 2016 election in an attempt to influence the outcome. The incident set off a wave of concern online about the persistent presence of inauthentic accounts, but detection methods to sniff out such accounts remained unreliable for years.

When tech billionaire Elon Musk took over Twitter in 2022, he promised to address the issues of ""bots"" on the platform, conducting several purges early in his ownership of the company that took down many accounts. Several studies have shown, however, that suspected inauthentic activity on the platform has remained at persistent levels since Musk bought Twitter.

The new location-revealing feature is a different approach to the issue.

As soon as it appeared live for users, X was flooded with viral posts showing that numerous high-engagement, MAGA-branded accounts that present themselves as those of patriotic Americans appear to instead be based overseas, including in Eastern Europe, Thailand, Nigeria and Bangladesh.

An account that calls itself “ULTRAMAGA 🇺🇸 TRUMP🇺🇸2028,” claiming to be based in Washington, D.C., is listed as being based in Africa. Another now-deleted account with a President Donald Trump-inspired username — “Trump Is My President” — was listed as being based in Macedonia. And an account with the username @American, complete with a profile picture featuring a bald eagle over an American flag, is apparently based in South Asia.

Users also attempted to target left-leaning accounts.

Some pointed to an unofficial account with several hundred followers that purported to represent the Democratic Socialists of America, which X listed as being based in Portugal. However, the real account for the political party has over 300,000 followers and is verified.

Some users pushed back against the locations listed on their account. Three accounts belonging to NBC News journalists showed locations that did not correlate to where they are based but to where they had traveled to recently instead.

X also placed a warning that popped up when a user's location is clicked on: ""The country or region that an account is based can be impacted by recent travel or temporary relocation. This data may not be accurate and can change periodically.""

While it's not clear exactly how X was determining users' locations, Bier posted Sunday night that the system was still evolving. In response to a post asking if the company had taken a shortcut and questioning its accuracy, Bier wrote that an upgrade would happen the next day.

""Accuracy will be nearly 99.99%,"" he wrote.

But the posts that stirred the biggest frenzy came Friday morning, when screenshots and screen recordings claiming that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security account was listed as being based in Israel quickly went viral. The department and Bier have both denied the speculation, claiming the posts are spreading misinformation.

X users circulated images and videos that alleged to show the location field displaying “Tel Aviv, Israel.” The account information feature abruptly disappeared Friday night.

NBC News did not view the account’s location before the feature went away Friday and has not confirmed the authenticity of the posts.

The situation comes amid mounting backlash from across the political spectrum to U.S. officials’ support for Israel, which many commentators have lamented as appearing to prioritize a foreign entity over America.

DHS initially responded with a meme-like image of Trump, looking stunned, which neither confirmed nor denied the discourse about its account location.

On Sunday, it followed up with an official denial.

“I can’t believe we have to say this, but this account has only ever been run and operated from the United States,” DHS posted. “Screenshots are easy to forge, videos are easy to manipulate. Thank you for your attention to this matter.”

Reached for comment, a spokesperson for DHS pointed NBC News to the same social media statement.

The account information feature returned soon after Friday’s brief shutoff, with Bier announcing a global rollout Saturday. But the feature, which previously listed both an account’s current location and its location on the date of its creation, no longer shows the latter.

Bier also responded to the speculation by telling a user to “stop spreading misinformation,” saying X’s account information feature was temporarily shut off “because the account creation country was incorrect on a very small subset of old accounts, due to IP ranges changing over time.” He did not clarify whether such an error was present on DHS’ account specifically.

Still, he responded to some of the posts showing the DHS account as being based in Israel, calling the claim “fake news.”

“Location was not available on any gray check [government] account at any point,” he wrote in response to one screen recording, which X has now labeled as “manipulated media.” “Furthermore, the DHS has only shown IPs from the United States since account creation.”

As of Sunday morning, however, the location information is available again on the DHS account. This time, it reads: “United States.” But DHS appears to be the only gray-check government account that displays the location where it is based, as other government accounts now display only their dates of account creation and account verification.

Bier and X did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Bier said in a post that there are still “a few rough edges” around the feature that should be resolved by Tuesday.

“If any data is incorrect, it will be updated periodically based on best available information,” he wrote. “This happens on a delayed and randomized schedule to preserve privacy.”",2025-11-24 14:56:19.554000+00:00,both,"wave of is metaphor for series or trend; ironic quotes around ""

Her 2022 breakthrough, The Long Count, featured woozy, ambient soundscapes made from electronically processed samples of ancient Maya flutes. On her latest record, Desaceleradas (Decelerated), Beatriz turns her attention to the 90s trend of cumbia rebajada. Slowing the Afro-Latin dance genre of cumbia to a sludgy tempo, cumbia rebajada is a dub-influenced take on a typically upbeat, party-driven sound. DJ Gabriel Dueñez popularised the style with his bootleg cassettes; two of his earliest releases now form the basis of Beatriz’s experiments.

Landing somewhere between composer William Basinski’s Disintegration Loops and DJ Screw’s chopped’n’screwed production style, Desaceleradas slows the shaker-rattling, synth syncopations of cumbia rebajada into unrecognisable ambient territory. La Ronda y el Sonidero and Vinilos Trasnacionales contain hints of the signature cumbia shuffle and twanging synth melody, but Beatriz’s added tape hiss, reverb and melodic warping transform the style into an eerie, ethereal soundworld of nightmare fairground music and yearning drones.

Much more than just an academic exercise of slowing material down to its lowest possible bpm, Beatriz’s arrangements force us to focus on the innate strangeness of the present moment. On Bootlegs, a single synth tone becomes drawn-out, harsh industrial distortion. Cholombia, MTY highlights the atonal dissonance produced between the notes of a slow motion melody and Los Balleza rings out with cacophonous reverb.

Beatriz’s granular dissection of sounds means they’re constantly shifting, creating a sensation equivalent to sea sickness. This uneasy quality is the opposite of background meditative ambience. Instead, on Desaceleradas Beatriz performs a remarkable feat, showing how slowness and subtlety can contain just as much dread and discomfort as the chaos of noise.

NBC News Think,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/jim-justice-west-virginia-republican-sued-5-million-back-taxes-irs-doj-rcna245767,GOP Sen. Jim Justice agrees to pay $5 million in back taxes after DOJ lawsuit,"Sen. Jim Justice, R-W.Va., on Monday agreed to pay more than $5 million in back taxes after the Justice Department sued him over unpaid funds from more than 15 years ago.

The suit, filed Monday in the Southern District of West Virginia, said Justice and his wife had been contacted by the Treasury Department and were given notice of their 2009 debt but “have neglected or refused to make full payment of those assessments to the United States.”

The suit asked that the former billionaire and his wife pay the amount owed and any relief the court “deems just and proper.”

A filing later on Monday said the DOJ and the Justices had settled, with the couple agreeing to pay the full amount owed. A judge still needs to sign off on the agreement.

Justice's congressional office did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday night.

Bloomberg Law first reported the lawsuit.

The IRS last month filed liens against Justice and his wife of more than $8 million on unpaid taxes dating to 2009. Separately, a judge last year ordered six of Justice’s family companies to be sold to satisfy outstanding debt.

Justice’s family owns the Greenbrier Resort in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, which narrowly avoided foreclosure last year after the family settled debts.

Speaking with local media in October, Justice said that his companies “are complicated and complex” and that his children “are doing a magnificent job” running them, while alleging that collection efforts against him are politically motivated, The Associated Press reported at the time.

Justice has been a senator since January, when he succeeded Joe Manchin, a Democrat. He was governor from 2017 to 2025. Before he was governor, he was known as the heir to the West Virginia coal company Bluestone.

Justice defeated his Democratic opponent last year by more than 40 percentage points, a margin similar to President Donald Trump’s victory in the state that year.",2025-11-25 03:48:11.317000+00:00,literal,Factual reporting on reporting and policy,literal,literal,0,literal,0.9660424,0.033957575,0.9660424,True

In every Palestinian home, there is a ""teta"" - a grandmother and keeper of family traditions, who shares her recipes for using olives and tells stories of when the whole family gathered to harvest them.

The small green or black fruits are primarily used to produce oil, a staple never missing from a Palestinian dinner table, as well as table olives that accompany many meals.

In this visual explainer, Al Jazeera looks at what makes the olive so special to Palestinian identity and life.

Olive trees have been cultivated across Palestine for thousands of years, serving as a source of livelihood, cultural heritage and resilience.

The olive harvest, known as ""mawsim al-zaytoun"", begins in October, with preparations starting in September.

Families ready their tools as the first September rains, talat al-matar, soften the soil, wash the trees and, as many Palestinian proverbs say, bring ""barakeh"" (blessings) for the harvest and the year ahead.

More than 100,000 families rely on the harvest for their income. It runs through to November and brings together the entire community.

In the years before Israel's war on Gaza began in October 2023, almost half of all cultivated land across the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip was planted with an estimated 10 million olive trees.

Palestinians use olives predominantly for oil, but every part of the tree finds a purpose:

Olive oil - About 90 percent of olives are used to extract oil, with different regions of Palestine producing distinct varieties.

Table olives - Eaten fresh, pickled or seasoned, table olives are a central feature of Palestinian cuisine, festivals and hospitality.

Soap - The city of Nablus is famous for its olive oil soap, which is rich in antioxidants and gentle on the skin.

Wood crafts - Handcrafted olive wood items are made from pruned branches, fallen wood, or old trees that are no longer productive.",2025-11-06 00:00:00,literal,Straightforward news reporting,literal,literal,0,literal,0.9671738,0.032826193,0.9671738,True
The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2025/nov/24/australia-climate-fossil-fuels-anthony-albanese-gas-expansion#comments,How can Australia convince the world to give up fossil fuels if Anthony Albanese is contradicting himself on gas expansion? | Bill Hare,"With another set of global climate talks behind us, the Australian government faces some tricky tasks before it takes over negotiations at the next round of talks next year in Turkey.



Cop30 in Belém, Brazil, did not deliver the bold fossil fuel phase-out roadmap we needed, but it did nudge the system forward with more scrutiny of fossil fuel producers.



And despite the weakness of the outcome, one can gain some important comfort by the fact that Bélem – and the G20 in Johannesburg at the weekend – both solidly endorsed the Paris agreement, its central goal of keeping warming to 1.5C and the importance of net zero emissions.



Cop30 agreed that an “ambition accelerator” will be needed to fill the gap between what governments are planning (projected to warm the world by 2.6C) and the agreed guardrails of the Paris agreement: a limit of 1.5C.



It also, crucially, began the momentum for developing a roadmap for a just transition away from fossil fuels, with more than 80 countries – including Australia – signing the “Belém declaration” on a transition away from fossil fuels.

While this declaration didn’t get support from the whole conference, Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has promised to move forward on its implementation during the course of this year, until he hands over to Cop31 in Turkey.

And there, Australia, under its deal with Turkey, will take over that momentum.

But there are significant questions as to whether the government will be able – or more importantly willing – to move this momentum for a fossil fuel phase-out forward.



This is especially so given that the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has just doubled down on his patently false claim that gas is needed for the energy transition.

The International Energy Agency released its annual report in the first week of Cop30. Its net zero emissions pathway confirms our concerns about Australian gas. The IEA’s new net zero scenario clearly states there is no need for new long-lead oil and gas projects, or coalmines.



It says fossil gas use needs to reduce quickly to 40% below today’s levels by 2035. Importantly, it also warns that a massive glut of liquefied natural gas supply is developing, a glut that is consistent with the IEA’s current policy scenario that would warm the world by 3C by 2100.



Gas is not needed to replace coal, and is not doing so across Asia – the destination for the vast majority of Australian fossil gas exports.



Add to this the leaked Deloitte draft report to the Western Australian government that warned Australia’s gas export bonanza to Asia would crowd out renewables and lock in CO 2 emissions for years to come.



Yet yesterday the prime minister was still dancing around this question, saying Australia’s gas would be needed as a backup to renewables but also that this “firming” would not require any new gas fields and should see the government move toward a phase-out of the massive export program it has approved all the way to 2070.

The truth is that much less gas is going to be needed to “firm” renewables, as grid-scale battery technologies take over the market.

In the next breath Albanese confirmed that his government would continue to allow new gas fields to go ahead, just as he allowed the massive North West Shelf development go ahead to 2070.



These two statements are in direct contradiction with each other and do not bode well for the prospect of his government moving forward a global agreement that aims to get the world to transition away from fossil fuels.

The IEA has also confirmed that carbon capture and storage is not the magic bullet Australia claims it is to deal with fossil gas emissions. Indeed our work shows that if Asian countries – and Australia – continue with expansion plans for deploying CCS, they could add an extra 25bn tonnes of CO 2 emissions to the atmosphere by 2050.

There are many in Australia’s political scene who ask, what does all of this have to do with us?



For those who love Australia’s bush, forests, coral reefs, marine life and ecosystems, I would say nearly everything. Because all of this depends on keeping warming to 1.5C.

This month we’ve also seen reports emerge of massive coral mortality at Ningaloo reef, caused by climate change-fuelled marine heatwaves. This reef and others like it are finished unless we can get fossil fuels phased out quickly and achieve net zero CO 2 in the next 25 years or so.



It’s physics. Getting to net zero CO 2 globally means we can halt global warming.

And getting to net zero CO 2 means rapidly phasing out fossil fuels. There’s simply no other way.

Australia cannot continue to develop and expand fossil fuel exports and pretend it’s going to be a renewable superpower supporting a 1.5C limit.

These contradictions will come into sharp focus over the next year and they are likely to get increasingly dangerous for the Albanese government as people wake up to the climate catastrophe unfolding around them, while watching their government fumble on the world stage.",2025-11-24 00:00:00,literal,Factual reporting on reporting and policy,literal,literal,0,literal,0.98808086,0.011919115,0.98808086,True
NBC News Think,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/tatiana-schlossberg-jfk-granddaughter-terminal-cancer-rcna245308,JFK's granddaughter Tatiana Schlossberg reveals terminal cancer diagnosis,"Tatiana Schlossberg, the daughter of Caroline Kennedy and Edwin Schlossberg and granddaughter of John F. Kennedy, has revealed her terminal cancer diagnosis in an essay published by The New Yorker on Saturday.

The 35-year-old has acute myeloid leukemia, with a rare mutation called Inversion 3.

Schlossberg said she was diagnosed on May 25, 2024, the same day she gave birth to her second child. Hours after delivery, her doctor noticed her abnormally high white-blood-cell count and moved her to another floor for further testing.

She initially dismissed the possibility of cancer and was stunned when the diagnosis was confirmed, saying she had considered herself ""one of the healthiest people"" she knew.

“This could not possibly be my life,” she wrote.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a cancer that starts in the bone marrow and quickly moves into the blood, according to the American Cancer Society (ACS). General symptoms include weight loss, fatigue, fever, night sweats and loss of appetite.

There are several subtypes of AML that are important in determining a person's prognosis, according to the ACS. Schlossberg's subtype —an inversion of chromosome 3 — is listed as an unfavorable abnormality of AML on the ACS website.

Schlossberg spent five weeks at Columbia Presbyterian after her daughter’s birth before her blast-cell count dropped enough for her to begin chemotherapy at home. Her care later moved to Memorial Sloan Kettering, where she underwent a bone-marrow transplant and spent more than 50 days before returning home for more treatment.

In January, Schlossberg joined a clinical trial for CAR T-cell therapy. She wrote that much of the treatment unfolded from her hospital bed as her cousin, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was nominated and confirmed as secretary of health and human services, a role she believes he was unqualified for.

Schlossberg thanked her husband and her family for their support and for countless days spent at her bedside.

“My parents and my brother and sister, too, have been raising my children and sitting in my various hospital rooms almost every day for the last year and a half,” she added.

Her brother, Jack Schlossberg, announced earlier this month that he is running for Congress. The 32-year-old is running for the New York City seat that has long been held by Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler, who in September announced he will not seek re-election.

Despite all of Tatiana Schlossberg’s treatments, she said, the cancer continued to return.

“During the latest clinical trial, my doctor told me that he could keep me alive for a year, maybe,” she wrote. “My first thought was that my kids, whose faces live permanently on the inside of my eyelids, wouldn’t remember me.”

Schlossberg is now trying her best to be in the present with her children.

By profession a writer, for several years Schlossberg was a reporter for the science section of The New York Times, where she covered climate change and the environment.

Schlossberg’s essay comes on the 62nd anniversary of her grandfather’s assassination, adding her diagnosis to a long history of tragedy within the Kennedy family.

John F. Kennedy’s son, John F. Kennedy Jr., and his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, died in a plane crash in 1999.

Ethel Kennedy, the widow of Robert F. Kennedy Sr., who was assassinated in 1968, died in October 2024 of complications from a stroke.

That’s what it was like to be part of Cop30 in Brazil. And yet more than 190 countries came together in the rainforest of the Amazon and reaffirmed their faith in multilateralism, the Paris agreement and the need to redouble our efforts to keep global warming to 1.5C.

We went to Cop because working with other countries to tackle the climate crisis is the only way to protect our home and way of life. We know the UK produces just 1% of emissions, which is why, as the prime minister said in Belém, our government is “all-in” on working with others to reduce the remaining 99%.

We also know there are huge opportunities from driving the transition forward, which is why in Britain we are making historic investments in renewables and nuclear, upgrading millions of homes, and acting to protect nature.

It is true that Britain wanted more from this Cop, including details of how we would speed up the global energy transition through an agreement that explicitly pledged a roadmap for the transition away from fossil fuels. This didn’t happen because some countries would not agree.

Yet on this issue, we have seen the emergence of an impressive coalition of 83 countries from the global north and global south, backed by more than 140 global businesses and civil society groups. And Brazil will launch a roadmap to help countries transition away from fossil fuels and scale up clean energy.

This offers such an important lesson: that detailed negotiations matter, but the movements we build around them profoundly influence what can be delivered. The roadmap to achieve our goal to halt and reverse deforestation by 2030 offers the same opportunity to drive forward our global efforts to tackle the nature and climate crises together.

There is also a larger picture here. This year’s summit was a test of whether, at a time of political challenge, countries would keep working together on the greatest collective threat we face or, with the US stepping out of the Paris agreement, there might be a domino effect of others departing. For all the challenges, countries chose the path of cooperation.

Cop30 therefore forms part of the long history of these negotiations that have seen the world change its trajectory from 4C of warming around a decade ago to 2.3- 2.5C. Despite that progress, our goal is 1.5C for a reason – because the science is clear that every fraction of a degree matters in limiting the impacts people will face here and around the world. That is why it is important that the world has pledged to enhance efforts to meet it through the Belém Mission to 1.5 and Global Implementation Accelerator.

Ambition on emissions reduction goes hand-in-hand with finance to make that possible, including for developing countries. Last year, countries agreed that, by 2035, we would need to mobilise at least $300bn (£230bn) of climate finance annually for developing countries. This year, as a core part of our fight against climate change, we agreed that this finance needs to be targeted at aiming to treble the support to building resilience to climate impacts.

Our Brazilian hosts were determined to make this the implementation Cop – and much progress was made outside the negotiating halls. This was, of course, the first Cop in the Amazon, and the UK was proud to work with Brazil in the two years running up to the summit to help it develop the Tropical Forest Forever Facility, which offers an incredibly inspiring solution to global deforestation.

We also worked alongside Brazil and many others on the Global Climate Action Agenda, which is about building the coalitions spanning governments, businesses, cities and civil society needed to accelerate action on the ground – on issues from reducing methane emissions and phasing out coal, to unlocking investment in clean energy.

Thousands of British businesses were involved in these initiatives. Our researchers, universities, mayors and others were also deeply engaged on climate issues at this Cop. And the UK was key to delivering the final outcomes of this summit, because of our record of climate leadership at home and abroad, as well as the extraordinary skill and determination of our civil service.

The message coming out of Belém was clear: despite the noise, clean energy and climate action remain the foundation on which the global economy is being remade and rebuilt. We are up against the march of time and massive global forces that would slow down or stop action. In the face of this opposition, multilateralism is our best hope.

God Will Open Doors by Walter Hawkins. I grew up on the Hawkins gospel family. They were my teachers. I was raised by my grandparents, and my auntie fell in love with the gospel sound and imported records from America – although my grandparents thought it was a bit too secular, even though it was gospel.

The song I inexplicably know every lyric to For some reason, out of all his songs, Adore by Prince always speaks to me.

The first single I bought

Funkin’ for Jamaica (NY) by Tom Browne from Red Records in Brixton, although I was so young I could hardly reach the counter.

The best song to play at a party

Sex Machine by James Brown gets everybody up, and sends everybody nuts. It’s one of those songs that cuts through everyone’s musical taste.

The song I can no longer listen to

It really hurts listening to Greatest Love of All by Whitney Houston, because I knew her so well. It’s funny, I don’t feel that way about Prince’s music. But anything by Whitney just destroys me.

The best song to have sex to

Distant Lover by Marvin Gaye.

The song I do at karaoke

If there’s one song that gets people moving, it’s Gimme Some More by Busta Rhymes. It’s such a wicked tune, and you don’t have to be a great singer. I go for the funky stuff and Busta’s my boy.

The song I secretly like, but tell everybody I hate

I’m always pretending to people I’m a bit too past it to like Shake It Off by Taylor Swift. I’m a grandmother, babe. And a soul singer. They’re like: “What the hell? Whatcha doing here?”

The song that makes me cry

Every time I hear I’m Still Here by Dorinda Clark-Cole from the Clark Sisters – who are like the female Jacksons of the gospel world – I’m in tears. That song always hits me.

The song that changed my life

What’s Going On by Marvin Gaye. My dad played it to me in the car when I was around 12. I just remember looking at him and saying: “I don’t want to do gospel music for much longer, Dad. I want to do this kind of music.”

The song that gets me up in the morning

I always tell my band to practise Yatra-Ta by Tania Maria. I’m very much into my Brazilian jazz and Latino. I love all that stuff, because my grandfather’s Portuguese, so even though I’m Jamaican, I have a big Latino influence. It’s in the blood.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/nov/24/matt-maltese-songwriter-rosalia-shakespeare,"‘The world is such a nice thing!’: Matt Maltese, the songwriter for pop’s A-list … and Shakespeare","Three years back, Matt Maltese was in a casual co-writing session with some friends. Out of it came a song called Magnolias, a stripped back piano ballad about imagining his own funeral. “I didn’t think anything of it,” he says. “And then two years later, we heard some quite bizarre whispers that Rosalía had somehow heard it.” It was true: six months ago, Maltese was sent the Spanish pop star’s demo of the song. He tried not to get too excited, even when, a few weeks back, a blurred-out photo of a Rosalía album tracklisting appeared online. “On the WhatsApp group we were like: I think that says Magnolias!”

Magnolias ended up as the final track on Rosalía’s new operatic masterpiece, Lux: one of the most talked-about albums of the year, currently sitting in the UK Top 5. Maltese first heard the finished song the day the album came out, when he’d got back to London from a US tour. “I took a long jet-lagged walk and listened to the whole album to contextualise it. It’s extraordinary.” On Magnolias, Rosalía changed some words, he says, “and dramatised it incredibly. It’s exquisite. It’s a gift from someone, somewhere, that it fell into her lap.” It’s all anyone has wanted to talk to him about since. “I’ve had a lot of follow backs on Instagram,” he smiles.

The 30-year-old British-Canadian has quietly become a successful and influential figure. Across six solo albums since 2018, Maltese’s indie-pop balladry mixes a modern type of male sensitivity with the wry humour of his hero, Leonard Cohen. Aided by a viral TikTok moment, he has six million monthly listeners on Spotify and over 1bn streams combined; his latest album Hers, a lush distillation of longing and desire, was his first to chart.

It’s won him A-list fans in Sabrina Carpenter, Doja Cat, Frank Ocean, Laufey and BTS’s V, and made him a songwriter in demand. Maltese has written for and with artists such as Celeste, Joy Crookes, Jamie T and Tom Misch – even the Bard himself. Last year, Maltese wrote music for a Royal Shakespeare Company production of Twelfth Night in Stratford-upon-Avon. Next month it comes to the Barbican in London, where we meet by its lakeside terrace on an unseasonably warm afternoon. “Co-writing with Shakespeare,” he smiles. “That’s probably the best one, right?”

Growing up in Reading to Canadian parents, Maltese moved to London in his teens, falling into the “great community” of the burgeoning south London scene centred on the Brixton Windmill pub. But among alternative post-punk bands such as Goat Girl, Shame and Sorry, he was very much the odd one out. “I was like, I’m the soppiest one here. They’re ‘fuck the world’ and I’m like, ‘ah, but the world is such a nice thing’.”

In 2015 he signed to Atlantic Records off the back of promising Soundcloud demos. “They told me I was the voice of a generation.” But that didn’t save him when 2018 debut album Bad Contestant didn’t perform to Atlantic’s expectations. He was an ill fit for the major label system, he says: “As a snobbish 19-year-old, I said no to a lot of things.” He was once asked to cover John Lennon’s Happy Xmas (War is Over) for a BBC Christmas trailer. “And I insisted that I would only do it if I could record it in a minor key.” He starts laughing. “It was atrocious.” It never got used, and he was subsequently dropped. “But I needed that blow. I wasn’t treating it enough like a job.”

He looked at what was left of his £50,000 advance. “I worked out I had eight months before I’d have to quit music and get a job.” So he hibernated in his bedroom, sore from Atlantic’s rejection and “some messy personal relationship stuff”, and worked on songs. “That period was good for me because it made me comfortable in my own skin. It really made me write songs even more from the heart.” His independently released 2019 second album Krystal started a “positive spiral”.

His career really took off in 2021 when his 2017 track As the World Caves In, an apocalyptic ballad that imagined Donald Trump and Theresa May spending the last night on earth together, blew up on TikTok. Charli xcx and Shawn Mendes posted about it; on one “ridiculous day” it was the second most streamed song worldwide by a British artist behind Dua Lipa. After Atlantic, it was vindication, to a point. “They are making all the money from it,” he smiles ruefully: around £20,000 a week at the song’s height.

But it brought him a whole new fanbase. “It used to be divorced dads and students.” Now, he has screaming fans in the 18-23 age range. “Especially in America,” he says, where he’s just headlined the 5,900 capacity Greek theatre in Los Angeles. “But it’s so funny to self-identify that I’ve become a TikTok person. I think that skewed a lot of people’s impressions.”

Maltese’s real passion is the craft of songwriting. “I didn’t come out the womb with a mic on.” Hence his embrace of the co-writing sideline. Sometimes within a group – Magnolias was written in that session with Danny Casio, Sophie May and Daniel Wilson – but often intimately with the artist themselves.

He has a particularly close relationship with the chart-topping jazz-pop singer Celeste. “She’s great at disrupting the norm.” Once, uninspired by the expensive studio environment, she took him to a grotty rehearsal space. “It was January and it was freezing, a big dark room with no heating. We wrote there for a week.” They ended up with three songs for Celeste’s wonderful new album Woman of Faces – destined for the Top 10 this week – and the standalone track Everyday.

Joy Crookes is another artist Maltese is close to: after 2021’s Skin, he co-wrote Crookes’ 2025 single Mathematics. When he heard the finished track, he was amazed that UK rap legend Kano had added a guest verse. “I am a white boy from Reading; to have a credit with Kano is just insanity.” Even after Rosalía, Maltese is still getting used to his growing imprint on pop. “I don’t necessarily feel like I’m hugely culturally relevant. I’m just someone obsessed with songwriters from the 70s. I feel very lucky that people care.”",2025-11-24 00:00:00,literal,Straightforward news reporting,literal,literal,0,figurative,0.00073445943,0.9992655,0.9992655,False

Millions of children across the United States are stepping into kindergarten for the first time. My son is one of them.

It's emotional for any parent — watching your child take those steps into the world, into routine, into independence. For immigrant parents like my wife and me, it was overwhelming.

My son, Russell Siima, started the first year of his primary education in a public school in Montgomery County, Md. My wife and I dropped my son off, his baby brother in tow. We waved goodbye and encouraged him to be brave. His classroom has colorful posters, smart boards and cozy reading corners filled with books and comfy swivel chairs. Each child has a cubby with their name on it for storing the school supplies tucked into their backpacks.

Like every parent, I hope my child likes — no, make that loves — their teacher. That they feel welcome in school and enjoy their first step to the many years of learning ahead.

But as my son marks this milestone, I have mixed emotions. I am so excited about his schooling. Then I flash back to my own first day, in my home country of Uganda. It was a very different experience.

When I was 4, my mother sent me to another county in rural southwestern Uganda — to live with my uncle's family, where school options were better. In my home county, the nearest ""church school"" was about 9 miles away – too great a distance for a child to walk. I began my education in what we called ""church school."" Used for Sunday mass, the building itself was a long, rectangular room with a dirt floor, no ceiling and wooden shutters instead of glass windows. A row of concrete pillars held up the tin roof. When it rained, the noise was so deafening that classes had to pause.

On my first day at church school, my cousin Mary and her older brother walked with me the mile or so to school and dropped me off.

I was only at that school for a year before I transferred to Katebe Primary School — the best in the county. It gave me a solid foundation for learning. But it wasn't ideal. When I tell my American friends that our first job every morning was to sweep the classroom before we sat down, they chuckle. For me, it was serious business — it taught me to take care of the space around me, to be responsible even with very little.

Yet I dreamed of one day coming to a classroom where the only thing I had to carry was curiosity.

My dream came true in the fall of 2004. I arrived in Florida from Uganda as a 19-year-old, fresh off the plane, stepping foot into my first American classroom at Tallahassee Community College. I had been adopted by a generous Floridian couple — Russell and Cheri Rainey — who, after meeting me in Uganda and hearing about my passion for education, decided to bring me into their family. They became Mom and Dad.

I remember that first semester, wide-eyed as I walked the campus of 15,000 students, marveling at the library, the technology and the professors who deeply cared about my curiosity. I used to sit in those classrooms thinking: One day, I hope my children — indeed all kids — get to have this kind of opportunity.

I graduated top of my class, was unanimously selected to give the 2006 commencement address at the Leon Tucker Civic Center, earned a scholarship to Florida State University and, later, graduate school.

So last week, standing in a kindergarten hallway beside my wife — watching our firstborn take his first steps into formal schooling at age five — we were moved beyond words. The school had so many resources — a fully stocked library, a music room, an art room, shelves of learning materials.

In Uganda, schools with these kinds of resources are virtually inaccessible to the average child. They're reserved for maybe two percent of the population — mostly the children of wealthy families, high-earning businesspeople or government elites.

To us, it felt like witnessing a dream we'd carried quietly for years — one we wish every child, not just our own, could one day live.

In that moment, we knew: every sacrifice we've made, every mile we've walked — literally and figuratively — had led to this. And it was worth it.

Life, sometimes, comes full circle.

This moment reminded me of something deeply personal: that showing up as a father, being present, is a quiet miracle many take for granted. I never had my dad there for school drop-off.

My father was alive during my early years but mostly absent in my life — working far from home, present only on holidays. By the time I was ten, he had died. Between 1988 and 1992, I lost both my parents and three siblings. I was part of a generation of Ugandan children left behind by the HIV/AIDS epidemic, raised by my grandmother.

On my son's first day in kindergarten, I got to be there.

I also remembered those who made this possible — my Ugandan mother, who sent me away so I could learn; my grandmother, who raised me when no one else could; and the Raineys, whose act of kindness unlocked a future I once thought impossible. There's a saying from Africa: One act of generosity can unlock a thousand doors. I'm living proof. And now, so is my son.

Too many children around the world don't get this chance. Children in refugee camps, war zones and neglected communities.

I pray every child gets a first day like this — full of love, nerves, curiosity and hope. I pray that every parent, no matter where they come from, gets the chance to witness it.

Al Jazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/11/24/what-is-really-behind-greg-abbotts-war-on,What is really behind Greg Abbott’s ‘war on Sharia’,"Like other US officials, the Texas governor is eager to weaponise Islamophobia for political gain.

When on November 19 Texas Governor Greg Abbott called for an official investigation into so-called “Sharia courts”, it was not based on evidence, complaints, or any legal irregularity. It was a political performance. There are no Sharia courts in Texas — only voluntary Muslim mediation panels operating under the same framework used by Jewish beth din courts and Christian arbitration services.

Yet in a letter sent to district attorneys and sheriffs demanding an investigation, Abbott wrote that “The Constitution’s religious protections provide no authority for religious courts to skirt state and federal laws simply by donning robes and pronouncing positions inconsistent with western civilization,” implying that Muslims were secretly building an alternative legal system.

This is not law enforcement. It is political theatre designed to stoke fear.

A day earlier, on November 18, Abbott issued an executive order designating the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) — the largest Muslim civil rights organisation in the country — as a “foreign terrorist organisation” (FTO).

The order cited no crimes, no violence, no plot, no prosecutorial record. It was simply a sweeping claim that an American civil rights group constituted a national security threat.

Lawyers immediately noted that Abbott does not have the authority to designate FTOs; only the US federal government does. But again, the point was not legal accuracy.

This ineffectual order was more about political messaging than anything else. It was aimed to portray Muslim Americans and their institutions as suspect and their civic engagement as a security risk.

Abbott’s actions are the latest product of a long-running American panic machine that transforms ordinary Muslim life into a threat narrative. This panic machine has been in operation for decades and has repeatedly weaponised Sharia for political gain.

For example, in the late 2000s, a coordinated national campaign—spearheaded by activists like David Yerushalmi and organisations such as ACT for America—pushed legislators across the country to introduce “anti-Sharia” bills. In the early 2010s, more than 40 states considered laws barring courts from applying “foreign law”, a euphemism universally understood to mean Islamic law.

The most extreme example occurred in the US state of Oklahoma, where voters approved a constitutional amendment explicitly banning Sharia and the application of international law. When the law was challenged in court, a federal judge blocked it.

This and other legal challenges exposed these measures for what they were: political stunts, not responses to real legal problems. Yet the broader campaign succeeded in normalising the idea that Muslim religious practice itself is a national security threat, paving the way for later escalations, including Abbott’s actions in Texas today.

Months before the call to investigate “Sharia courts”, again in Texas, a Muslim-led real estate project was targeted with a Department of Justice (DOJ) investigation and branded online as a “Sharia colony”. Local residents were told that Islamic law would govern the neighbourhood, that non-Muslims would be excluded, and that the development was part of a creeping Islamic takeover. None of the rumours were true: the project was open to everyone and sought only to address the region’s housing crisis.

The DOJ ended its investigation after finding no illegality in June, but in September, Governor Abbott signed a law banning “Sharia compounds” in Texas.

This dynamic has played out far beyond Texas. In the state of Tennessee, opponents of a mosque in Murfreesboro argued that Islam was not a religion and that Muslims were therefore undeserving of First Amendment protection. The argument defied centuries of constitutional doctrine, but that didn’t matter; the point was to make Muslim religious life appear legally illegitimate.

In Dearborn, Michigan, a city with one of the country’s oldest Arab and Muslim communities, viral hoaxes have repeatedly claimed the city has been “taken over by Sharia law”. Fabricated videos, manipulated headlines, and images from other countries have been circulated to create the illusion of Islamic governance on American soil. Fact-checks have debunked these narratives, yet the rumours have persisted.

Muslim public figures have also been targeted. During his campaign, New York City’s Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani faced racist memes and conspiracy theories claiming he was plotting to usher in “Sharia rule” if elected. None of Mamdani’s policy proposals have any religious content whatsoever. His agenda focuses on mass transit, housing, and police accountability. But to those invested in Sharia panic, a Muslim in public office is always presumed to be a Trojan horse.

And it is not just Republicans who have fanned these flames. Major newspapers, liberal politicians, and even civil liberties institutions have repeatedly adopted the underlying framing that Islamic law is inherently foreign, inherently political, or inherently at odds with American values. By accepting the premise that Sharia is a threat, they effectively validate the narrative architecture of Islamophobia even when they claim to oppose it.

These incidents reveal a consistent pattern: the panic surrounding Sharia is not about law, safety, or constitutional principle. It is about boundary maintenance in a country struggling with demographic change. It is about who gets to be seen as American and who remains permanently suspect. The panic keeps reemerging not because it reflects valid concerns, but because it is useful — an instrument for mobilising voters, policing civic belonging, and justifying state surveillance.

What makes this all the more ironic is that Sharia, as understood by Islamic scholars across centuries, bears little resemblance to the caricatures that animate US politics. In Arabic, Sharia means “a path to the water”, a metaphor for moral and spiritual nourishment.

It is a broad ethical framework concerned with justice, welfare, and accountability. Its foundational aims — the maqāṣid al-sharīʿa — revolve around protecting life, intellect, faith, property, and human dignity. The tradition contains sophisticated doctrines of equity (istiḥsān), public interest (maṣlaḥa), and custom (ʿurf), which operate much like the equitable and contextual tools of modern common law systems.

Far from being an alien code, Sharia shares deep structural resonances with Western legal traditions. As Professor John Makdisi demonstrated in a landmark North Carolina Law Review article, several foundational features of English common law bear striking parallels to Islamic legal institutions, likely transmitted through Norman Sicily. This history matters not because it collapses distinctions between legal systems, but because it exposes the absurdity of the idea that Islamic law is inherently incompatible with Western governance.

The United States once understood that legacy. When the Supreme Court chamber was unveiled in 1935, it featured a marble frieze depicting humanity’s greatest lawgivers, including Prophet Muhammad, shown holding a Quran as a symbol of justice and moral authority. Today, acknowledging that simple historical fact would itself trigger outrage.

The renewed Sharia panic is not about Islam entering American courts; it is about Islam entering American civic life. It is about Muslim political participation, Muslim community development, Muslim institutions, and Muslim representation — all recast as existential threats. As the country enters another election cycle animated by anti-diversity rhetoric, anti-Muslim conspiracy theories, and attacks on Middle East studies programmes, Sharia becomes a flexible container for a much older anxiety: the fear of a pluralistic America.

The danger is not Sharia. The danger is the political machinery that turns ordinary Muslim Americans into objects of suspicion, targets of state power, and props in a culture war they did not choose. If there is anything Americans should fear, it is not Islamic law, but the weaponisation of fear.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/nov/24/jimmy-cliff-jamaican-reggae-singer-actor-and-cultural-icon-dies-aged-81,"Jimmy Cliff, Jamaican reggae singer, actor and cultural icon, dies aged 81","Jimmy Cliff, the singer and actor whose mellifluous voice helped to turn reggae into a global phenomenon, has died aged 81.

A message from his wife Latifa Chambers on Instagram reads: “It’s with profound sadness that I share that my husband, Jimmy Cliff, has crossed over due to a seizure followed by pneumonia. I am thankful for his family, friends, fellow artists and coworkers who have shared his journey with him. To all his fans around the world, please know that your support was his strength throughout his whole career … Jimmy, my darling, may you rest in peace. I will follow your wishes.” Her message was also signed by their children, Lilty and Aken.

With hits including You Can Get It If You Really Want, I Can See Clearly Now and Wonderful World, Beautiful People, Cliff’s upbeat musical temperament brought him a large and longstanding fanbase. His lead acting role in 1972 crime drama The Harder They Come was also acclaimed, with the film seen as a cornerstone of Jamaican cinema.

He is one of just a handful of musicians, alongside Bob Marley and others, to be awarded the Jamaican Order of Merit.

Jamaican prime minister Andrew Holness was among those paying tribute to Cliff, calling him “a true cultural giant whose music carried the heart of our nation to the world … Jimmy Cliff told our story with honesty and soul. His music lifted people through hard times, inspired generations, and helped to shape the global respect that Jamaican culture enjoys today.”

Cliff was born in Saint James, Jamaica in 1944, and his music career began in the early 1960s after he moved to the island’s capital Kingston and began collaborating with producer Leslie Kong. Kong’s family owned a record shop called Beverley’s and Cliff wrote a song namechecking it to help persuade Kong – who would go on to become key producer in reggae – to work with him.

He had a number of local hits and was selected as a Jamaican representative at the World’s Fair expo in New York in 1964, but his career really took off later that decade after he signed to Island Records.

He was initially marketed to a rock crowd – hence curios such as his cover of Whiter Shade of Pale – and found life in his new home of London alienating, later describing the city as “a bitch … I experienced racism in a manner I had never experienced before”. But the sparkling ska of 1969’s Wonderful World, Beautiful People proved to be his breakthrough UK hit, reaching No 6 in the charts.

Its message of hope and unity carried with it a rebuke of the current state of the world (“cheating, backbiting, scandalising and hating”) and that blend of beautiful music and socially conscious lyrics became a core part of Cliff’s artistry. After writing Vietnam, a song pleading for the end to that war, Cliff later recalled: “The critics in London said, ‘Wow! How is he singing this kind of serious song and such a happy rhythm?’ And I said: Wow! I didn’t even realise I was doing that. I was just writing a song to a rhythm.”

Cliff was back in the UK Top 10 in 1970 with a cover of Cat Stevens’s Wild World, before filming The Harder They Come in 1972, after the film’s director Perry Henzell intuited that he would make a good actor.

Its soundtrack album, with Cliff performances such as the title track and You Can Get It If You Really Want alongside others by Desmond Dekker, Toots & the Maytals and more, helped to bring reggae to a wider audience, especially in the US where the film was eventually released in 1973.

The film’s gangster milieu was familiar to Cliff, as he recalled in the Observer in 2022: “When I came to Kingston I lived in areas that were gangster-infested, and to be quite honest, the only thing that stopped me from joining those gangs full-time was I didn’t know where I would bury my head if my family heard that I was in Kingston firing a gun.”

Cliff continued to tour and release albums in the 1970s, and had high-profile appearances in the US such as a booking on Saturday Night Live. He took some time away from music in the mid-late 1970s, travelling to Africa to reconnect with his ancestral roots, and converting to Islam: the 1978 album Give Thankx was partly inspired by those travels.

Bruce Springsteen championed his song Trapped by playing it on tour in the early 1980s, and a live version appeared on the massive-selling charity album We Are the World.

In 1994, he had a huge flush of new fame with his version of I Can See Clearly Now, which appeared on the soundtrack to the Jamaican bobsled drama film Cool Runnings: it returned him to the UK Top 40 for the first time since 1970, topped the French charts and was a hit elsewhere.

Cliff collaborated with numerous other artists over the years from the Rolling Stones to Sting. More recently he worked with the lead singer of punk band Rancid, Tim Armstrong, on an EP and album, the latter winning a Grammy for best reggae album – one of two wins from seven nominations over the years.

Cliff’s most recent album is 2022’s Refugees, made with Wyclef Jean, capping a discography of more than 30 studio albums.

Despite the success of The Harder They Come, Cliff only occasionally returned to acting, most prominently with 1986’s Club Paradise, opposite Robin Williams, Rick Moranis and more.",2025-11-24 00:00:00,metaphor,Rocks used as metaphor for causes disruption,metaphor,figurative,1,figurative,0.0013462438,0.99865377,0.99865377,True
Al Jazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2025/11/23/israel-attacks-beirut-suburb-two-days-after-lebanon-agreed-for-talks,Israel attacks Beirut suburb two days after Lebanon agreed for talks,"Israel kills top Hezbollah commander only two days after Lebanon’s president said he was open to negotiations.

Israel has killed a senior Hezbollah commander in an attack on Beirut’s southern suburbs, which comes only two days after Lebanon’s president announced the country had succumbed to an Israeli pressure campaign and agreed to hold negotiations.

Hezbollah confirmed that its chief of staff, Haytham Ali Tabtabai, was among five people killed and 28 others wounded in the Israeli strike on Beirut’s Haret Hreik neighbourhood on Sunday.

Israeli officials and media have warned of a renewed escalation against Lebanon in recent weeks, claiming Hezbollah is regrouping and rearming. Meanwhile, Lebanon’s government has come under pressure from Israel via its main benefactor, the United States, as both countries urge it to move faster to disarm Hezbollah and meet with Israelis for direct talks.

Israel has ‘the upper hand’

Lebanon’s leadership had pushed for indirect negotiations with Israel, even though the issue is divisive inside the country. Just two days before Israel’s attack on Beirut’s suburb, Lebanon’s President Joseph Aoun addressed the issue.

“The Lebanese state is ready to negotiate under the UN, US or joint international sponsorship – any agreement that would establish a framework for a permanent end to transborder aggressions,” Aoun announced on Friday from Tyr, a southern city that suffered extensive damage during last year’s war.

Aoun did not say explicitly whether or not the talks would be direct. Analysts, however, told Al Jazeera that Israel’s recent uptick in attacks indicates it is not looking to negotiate.

Israel “has got the upper hand militarily at the moment, and they don’t seem to be interested in negotiating in earnest,” Nicholas Blanford, a nonresident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council, told Al Jazeera.

“They’re quite happy sniping away at Hezbollah on a daily basis … Lebanon is doing what they can under the circumstances, but I don’t think they have a willing interlocutor in the Israelis at this stage.”

Despite an ostensible ceasefire, Israel has intensified attacks in Lebanon’s south and Bekaa Valley in recent days. At least 13 people were killed by an Israeli strike on Lebanon’s largest Palestinian refugee camp last week, in an attack that killed mostly children and marked the highest death toll in a single strike since a ceasefire was agreed in November last year.

Israel has killed more than 300 people in Lebanon since then, including around 127 civilians, according to the United Nations. It also continues to occupy at least five points in south Lebanon, despite the ceasefire stating Israel would withdraw its troops from Lebanese territory.

“The problem is that Israel is not interested in negotiating at the moment. It wants to eliminate Hezbollah or push the Lebanese army into a clash with the party,” Kassem Kassir, a Lebanese journalist close to Hezbollah, told Al Jazeera.

“Every time Aoun or [Prime Minister Nawaf] Salam talk about negotiations, Israel escalates its aggression.”

Israel ‘should demonstrate good faith’

Tabtabai’s killing marks the highest-ranking Hezbollah target killed since the ceasefire. The attack also came a week to the day before Pope Leo XIV’s planned visit to the country and a day after Lebanon mutedly celebrated its 82nd independence day.

US and Israeli officials have warned Lebanon of an intensification should the country not move faster to disarm Hezbollah. In August, Lebanon’s cabinet approved a plan to have the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) disarm Hezbollah and bring the group’s weapons under the state’s control. Hezbollah has refused to relinquish its weapons, saying the move serves Israel.

Still, the Lebanese army has been criticised by some US officials for moving too slowly in disarming Hezbollah. Analysts say the Lebanese government has also been criticised for failing to establish a political consensus on the divisive issue.

But Israel’s actions are undermining the Lebanese government’s efforts, according to analysts. After Lebanon’s cabinet approved the plan to disarm Hezbollah, US Special Envoy Tom Barrack visited Israel in an effort to get its military to stop attacks and withdraw troops from the Lebanese territory. He came back empty-handed.

The US recently cancelled a planned trip by Lebanon’s army chief Rodolphe Haykal to Washington, DC after the LAF issued a statement critical of Israel. Haykal had previously proposed suspending LAF operations on disarming Hezbollah until Israel stops its attacks.

“If Israel actively wants to enter and succeed in negotiations, it should demonstrate good faith in entering, and ways for that would be to at least reduce attacks on Lebanese territory or withdraw from some points in the south. They could create a positive dynamic to develop a consensus,” David Wood, the International Crisis Group’s senior analyst for Lebanon, told Al Jazeera.

Choices before Hezbollah

Since last November’s ceasefire, Hezbollah has only responded to Israeli attacks once. Under its new Secretary-General Naim Qassem, the group has largely shown restraint.

Still, there are concerns in Lebanon that the group may decide to soon change tactics.

“There is definitely a mood to strike back against the Israelis, not just from today’s attack but in general,” Blanford said. “But they know very well that if they do, the Israelis will escalate, and no one in Lebanon will thank Hezbollah for doing that.”

Israel’s military superiority and its US backing leave Hezbollah and the Lebanese state with few choices. Currently in Lebanon, the issue of negotiations with Israel and Hezbollah’s disarmament is divisive.

Analysts said many in the country fervently oppose direct negotiations, though the government has expressed a willingness to enter indirect talks, similar to 2022’s maritime agreement between Israel and Lebanon.

Many in Lebanon, including Hezbollah’s supporters, say they would be open to seeing Israel withdraw its troops from southern Lebanon and demarcate the border. Few welcome a renewed aggression, suggesting diplomacy as a likely preference.

But analysts say that would require Israel to respect the agreements it enters into, including the various ceasefire deals it has repeatedly violated.

“What we’ve seen since the ceasefire is that Israel speaks more loudly with actions than words,” Wood said. “Opponents [of negotiations] can point to Israel’s behaviour in Lebanon, Syria and Gaza, and say Israel is not bound by its own agreements.”",2025-11-23 00:00:00,literal,Factual reporting on reporting and elections,literal,literal,0,literal,0.86188096,0.13811903,0.86188096,True
NBC News Think,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/judge-dismisses-cases-james-comey-letitia-james-finding-prosecutor-was-rcna244775,Judge dismisses cases against James Comey and Letitia James after finding prosecutor was unlawfully appointed,"A federal judge dismissed the criminal indictments against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James on Monday, finding the prosecutor who brought the cases, former Trump attorney Lindsey Halligan, was not lawfully appointed.

U.S. District Judge Cameron Currie said she agreed with Comey, who moved to dismiss the case on the grounds that Halligan's appointment was illegal.

""Because Ms. Halligan had no lawful authority to present the indictment, I will grant Mr. Comey’s motion and dismiss the indictment,"" Currie wrote in finding that Halligan lacked the authority to present a case to a grand jury.

""All actions flowing from Ms. Halligan’s defective appointment, including securing and signing Mr. Comey’s indictment, were unlawful exercises of executive power and are hereby set aside,"" the judge wrote, describing the insurance lawyer as ""a former White House aide with no prior prosecutorial experience.""

She issued a separate, similar ruling dismissing the James case.

“This case presents the unique, if not unprecedented, situation where an unconstitutionally appointed prosecutor, 'exercising power [she] did not lawfully possess,’… acted alone in conducting a grand jury proceeding and securing an indictment,” the ruling said.

Because Halligan, who was appointed interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia at President Donald Trump's direction, was the only prosecutor to present the cases and sign the indictments, the indictments should be voided, the judge found.

Attorney General Pam Bondi reacted to the dismissal of the cases by saying during a news conference in Memphis that the Justice Department will ""be taking all available legal action, including an immediate appeal.""

Bondi also defended Halligan, calling her ""an excellent"" attorney.

After the ruling, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters, “Lindsey Halligan was legally appointed, and that’s the administration’s position.”

The U.S. attorney’s office for the Eastern District of Virginia declined to comment. Halligan did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Comey, in a video on Instagram, said, ""I’m grateful that the court ended the case against me, which was a prosecution based on malevolence and incompetence and a reflection of what the Department of Justice has become under Donald Trump, which is heartbreaking.""

“This case mattered to me personally, obviously, but it matters most because a message has to be sent that the president of the United States cannot use the Department of Justice to target his political enemies,” he said.

""I know that Donald Trump will probably come after me again, and my attitude is going to be the same. I’m innocent. I am not afraid, and I believe in an independent federal judiciary, the gift from our founders that protects us from a would-be tyrant,"" he added.

Responding to Comey's statement, Bondi told reporters that she was ""not worried about someone who has been charged with a very serious crime,"" adding that ""his alleged actions were a betrayal of public trust.”

James praised the judge's ruling.

“I am heartened by today’s victory and grateful for the prayers and support I have received from around the country. I remain fearless in the face of these baseless charges as I continue fighting for New Yorkers every single day,” she said in a statement.

Her attorney, Abbe Lowell, said in a statement that the judge's order ""acknowledges what’s been clear about this case from the beginning. The President went to extreme measures to substitute one of his allies to bring these baseless charges after career prosecutors refused.""

""We will continue to challenge any further politically motivated charges through every lawful means available,” Lowell said.

Both indictments were dismissed ""without prejudice,"" meaning they could be brought again later.

Comey attorney Patrick Fitzgerald said in a statement that his reading of the ruling suggests the case can't be refiled because the five-year statute of limitations has expired since the indictment was brought.

Fitzgerald said the ruling ""indicates that because the indictment is void, the statute of limitations has run and there can be no further indictment.""

The Justice Department has said in court papers that it believes the case could still move forward because of U.S. Code 3288. The federal statute says in part, “Whenever an indictment or information charging a felony is dismissed for any reason after the period prescribed by the applicable statute of limitations has expired, a new indictment may be returned in the appropriate jurisdiction within six calendar months of the date of the dismissal of the indictment or information.”

Comey's attorneys have countered that the six-month grace period doesn't apply in this case because Halligan didn't have the power to bring an indictment to begin with, so all of her official actions are void — a prospect the judge expressly agreed with.

Comey and James have other motions pending before the judges presiding over their cases, contending the charges should be dismissed because they are the result of “selective and vindictive” prosecutions. Those motions seek to have the cases tossed ""with prejudice,"" meaning prosecutors couldn’t revive them.

Carl Tobias, the Williams Chair in Law at the University of Richmond School of Law, told NBC News that Monday's ruling would be difficult for the government to overcome.

“I think the government will do whatever it can to overturn this, but I don’t see how that’s going to happen,” he said.

The invalidation of Halligan’s appointment was fatal to the Comey and James indictments because of the unique role Halligan played in the cases against two of Trump’s political enemies, and it could have ripple effects on other cases that were handled under more typical processes.

Another high-profile defendant being prosecuted by Halligan's office, Kabul airport bombing suspect Mohammad Sharifullah, also filed a challenge to her appointment this month, charging she doesn't have the authority to supervise or participate in his case. Sharifullah was indicted by Halligan’s predecessor, and his motion is still pending.

A ruling disqualifying Alina Habba as the U.S. attorney in New Jersey has resulted in a number of criminal cases brought under her leadership being stuck in legal limbo while she appeals the decision.

Currie seemed largely skeptical of the Justice Department's defense of Halligan at a rare joint hearing on the issue with lawyers for Comey and James on Nov. 13, when a prosecutor portrayed questions about Halligan's appointment as ""a paperwork error.""

Comey's attorney said it was much more than that and a ""fatal flaw"" in the prosecution of his client.

Comey was indicted on charges of making a false statement to Congress and obstructing a congressional investigation, while James was indicted on charges of bank fraud and making a false statement to a financial institution. Both pleaded not guilty.

In a highly unusual move, Halligan was the lone prosecutor to present their cases to the grand jury and the lone prosecutor to sign their indictments. Other prosecutors in her office had recommended against charging Comey and James because they didn't believe there was enough evidence to secure convictions, NBC News previously reported.

Trump said he was naming Halligan U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia on Sept. 20 — the day after he forced out his initial pick, Erik Siebert, who resisted pressure to prosecute Comey and James.

Halligan's appointment was immediately viewed as problematic because, according to federal statute, people in that post may serve for only 120 days after having been appointed U.S. attorney unless they are confirmed by the Senate before then.

The Senate had not confirmed Siebert, so federal judges of the Eastern District of Virginia exercised their independent appointment authority to keep him on beyond the 120-day limit.

Lawyers for Comey and James contended that after Siebert was forced out, the responsibility for naming his replacement belonged to the judges, not Attorney General Pam Bondi. To rule otherwise, Comey's attorney said in a filing, would render the 120-day period ""meaningless, and the Attorney General could indefinitely evade the alternate procedures that Congress mandated.""

The Justice Department maintained that Halligan's appointment was valid since the office was vacant after Siebert's departure. The ""Senate has not refused advice and consent to Ms. Halligan — her nomination remains pending. The Attorney General therefore lawfully appointed Ms. Halligan as interim U.S. Attorney"" and ""the motions to dismiss should be denied,"" the Justice Department said in a filing.

Trump's Truth Social post naming Halligan to the position came the day after Siebert was forced out — and shortly after another social media post in which he publicly urged Bondi to push ahead with prosecutions of Comey, James and another perceived political adversary, Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California.

""Pam: I have reviewed over 30 statements and posts saying that, essentially, 'same old story as last time, all talk, no action. Nothing is being done. What about Comey, Adam ‘Shifty’ Schiff, Leticia??? They’re all guilty as hell, but nothing is going to be done,'” said the post, which a source previously confirmed to NBC News had been intended as a direct message to Bondi, not a public post.

""We can’t delay any longer, it’s killing our reputation and credibility,"" Trump continued, while praising Halligan as ""a really good lawyer.""

Five days after the post, Halligan, who had no prosecutorial experience, presented the Comey case to a grand jury. The presentation came days before a five-year statute of limitations on the charges was set to expire.

Currie, a Bill Clinton appointee who is based in South Carolina, heard the arguments on the disqualification issue instead of a judge from the Eastern District of Virginia since local judges would be involved in selecting Halligan's replacement.

The Trump administration's stance on the 120-day rule has led to U.S. attorneys in California and Nevada being disqualified, as well.

Mincey, 20, of Pompano Beach, Florida, was booked into the Jefferson County Jail on Saturday afternoon after campus police arrested him in connection with the attack that morning, according to jail records and a school spokesperson.

He remained behind bars Monday in lieu of $90,000 bail, jail records show. Charges were filed Monday, according to court documents.

One of two criminal complaints alleges that Mincey tried ""to intentionally cause the death of Jasire Peterson ... by stabbing him with a knife.""

The other alleges he committed ""assault 1st degree"" with ""serious physical injury to Joshua Underwood ... by stabbing him with a knife.""

Lawyer David Bigney said he represents Mincey's family, but said it's too early in the case to make public remarks.

""We are currently focused on gathering information and reviewing the evidence, which has not yet been fully received,"" he said. ""We ask for patience as the legal process moves forward.""

A spokesperson for the university, Alicia Rohan, said in a statement that the violence happened Saturday morning at the Birmingham campus' Football Operations Building.

The injured players were taken to a hospital, she said. ""Our thoughts are with them and their families as they recover,"" she said.

On Monday, UAB Blazers interim head coach Alex Mortensen said in video remarks posted to YouTube that he has met with the two injured players, who have been released from the hospital and are recovering.

The team lists both as defensive linemen.

Mincey has apparently been removed from the online roster. The Associated Press reported that he was an offensive lineman who transferred to UAB in May. The team’s online roster previously listed him as a 6-foot-4 redshirt freshman, who was previously at the University of Kentucky, the AP reported.

The university has not offered remarks about Mincey's status with the team.

Mortensen said at in a news conference after Saturday's loss against the University of South Florida that his team went ahead with the matchup to allow its seniors to play in their last game.

On Monday, he praised his players for pushing forward, even as some decided to sit it out.

Al Jazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/3/what-the-latest-polls-are-showing-in-the-mamdani-vs-cuomo-nyc-mayoral-race,What the latest polls are showing in the Mamdani vs Cuomo NYC mayoral race,"The most recent polls place Mamdani 14.3 points ahead of Cuomo, according to a RealClearPolitics poll average.

New York City’s mayoral race is entering its final stretch, with some five million registered voters set to cast their ballots on November 4 to choose the city’s next leader.

According to the New York City Board of Elections, 734,317 early votes have been cast over the past nine days – more than quadruple the total for the 2021 mayoral elections.

According to the latest RealClearPolitics average, Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani leads with 46.1 percent, holding a 14.3-point advantage over independent Andrew Cuomo at 31.8 percent and a 29.8-point lead over Republican Curtis Sliwa at 16.3 percent.

But late on Monday, Cuomo received endorsements from President Donald Trump, a Republican, and from Elon Musk, the world’s richest man. It is unclear if those last-minute endorsements will sway voters.

Mamdani, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), has energised liberal voters drawn to his proposals for universal, free childcare, free buses, and a rent freeze for New Yorkers living in about one million rent-regulated apartments.

New York City holds mayoral elections every four years, with a two-term limit for any individual. The current mayor, Democrat Eric Adams, who has been in office since January 2022, withdrew his candidacy earlier in the year following several controversies, most notably his federal criminal indictment on bribery and conspiracy charges, which was ultimately dismissed by a judge in April.

This year’s contest is notable for its three-way dynamic, bringing progressive, establishment and conservative forces to face off in the country’s largest city.

How accurate are the polls?

The latest polls put Mamdani between three and 25 points ahead of Cuomo, according to a selection of polls from RealClearPolitics.

Every poll carries a degree of uncertainty. While pollsters aim to capture a representative sample and mirror the wider electorate, there are margins of error. As such, actual levels of support fall within a few points of reported figures, with each surveyor using differing wording in issues such as how to treat undecided voters.

Aggregating different results helps to reduce bias.

However, most polls were wildly off about the Democratic Party’s primary for the New York mayoral race earlier in the year, largely predicting a comfortable win for Cuomo over Mamdani. Eventually, Mamdani won by a landslide.

How does polling work?

Polling organisations, such as Emerson College, Marist College and Quinnipiac University, regularly conduct public opinion surveys to gauge voter sentiment leading up to the primaries and general elections.

Surveys use random sampling, including contacting voters by phone, text, or online, and ask respondents about their candidate preferences, key issues influencing their vote and approval ratings.

Poll results include margins of error and sample sizes, which aid in interpreting accuracy and the fidelity of findings.

How the voting works

Unlike the primaries, which used ranked choice voting (RCV), the general election uses a first-past-the-post system, so whoever gets the most votes wins.

As of February, there were 5.1 million registered voters in New York City, of whom 65 percent were Democrats and 11 percent were Republicans. About 1.1 million voters were not registered with any party, and voter registration closed on October 25, one week before the November 4 election.

In the last New York City mayoral election, just more than 1.1 million voters cast ballots – about 21 percent of registered voters.

To be eligible to vote, residents of New York must:

Be a citizen of the United States

Have been a New York City resident for at least 30 days

Be at least 18 years old (you may preregister at 16 or 17, but can’t vote until you’re 18)

Not be in prison for a felony conviction

Not have been judged mentally incompetent by a court

Not be registered to vote elsewhere

When do polls open and close?

Polling stations will be open between 6am (11:00 GMT) and 9pm on November 4 (02:00 GMT on November 5).

Timings vary from location to location in the city, but polling stations open between 8am and 10am and close between 4pm and 9pm.

Early voting began on October 25 and ended on November 2.

Robert Redford died this week at the age of 89. But his performances are indelible.

We'll still see him as the Sundance Kid alongside Paul Newman's Butch Cassidy, leaping off a cliff into rocky rapids. Roy Hobbs in ""The Natural,"" shattering the stadium lights with a home run. Bob Woodward in ""All the President's Men,"" teamed with Dustin Hoffman's Carl Bernstein: reporters in scuffed shoes and dangling neckties, digging out the squalid details of a presidential scandal.

And then there are the fine films he directed, including ""Ordinary People,"" ""Quiz Show,"" and ""A River Runs Through It.""

But Robert Redford's artistic vision will be projected beyond his lifetime, in the works of filmmakers whose careers took off from the Sundance Institute and Film Festival — named after that infamous Kid — dedicated to supporting independent and risk-taking work.

""Blood Simple,"" the first film from the Coen Brothers, Steven Soderbergh's ""Sex, Lies, and Videotape,"" and Quentin Tarantino's ""Reservoir Dogs"" all premiered at Sundance. So did Kevin Smith's ""Clerks,"" Ava DuVernay's ""Middle of Nowhere,"" Ryan Coogler's ""Fruitvale Station,"" and Sian Heder's ""CODA,"" which went on to win three Oscars, including Best Picture.

""He opened a door on 'the possible' for so many young talented artists,"" John Cooper, who once headed the Sundance Film Festival, told us this week. ""And they went on to show others the possibilities in themselves.""

Robert Redford was, well, Robert Redford: handsome, famous and charismatic. But he didn't always embrace the golden smile life had bestowed on him, telling The New York Times in 1974, ""This glamour image can be a real handicap. Image is crap.""

As the critic Peter Debruge suggested in Variety this week, ""Sundance was his way…to put it in eco-conscious terms — of recycling the good fortune he'd enjoyed into opportunities for others.""

And he wasn't a distant benefactor. John Cooper described how much Redford enjoyed working over ideas with young filmmakers at the Sundance Institute each summer.

In 1977, a neo-Nazi group called the National Socialist Party of America applied for a permit to march through Skokie, Illinois, a predominantly Jewish, Chicago suburb. They wanted to wear brown shirts with swastika armbands and wave signs demanding ""free speech for white people.""

The village refused the permit. The group sued, and it ignited a national debate over the First Amendment that may sound familiar today. Does the constitutional right to free speech protect offensive, even hateful speech? Can words cause real damage?

Skokie's attorneys argued that seeing the swastika and hearing chants of ""Sieg Heil"" on their streets would amount to a physical attack on the hundreds of Holocaust survivors who lived in Skokie.

I remember speaking with Magda Brown over iced tea on her porch. She'd been a teenager in Hungary when the Nazi-aligned government began making anti-Jewish laws. She survived Auschwitz and Buchenwald. Her family was executed.

""The thought of Nazis in our streets today,"" she told me, ""brings back my worst fears.""

I told Magda Brown that the young Chicago Nazis I'd interviewed in their small storefront headquarters looked more ridiculous than menacing. Magda answered, ""That's what the Nazis looked like to us in 1933, too,"" — the year Hitler came to power in Germany.

David Goldberger was the ACLU lawyer who argued in the U.S. Supreme Court for the right of the neo-Nazis to march and speak.

""But our real client was always the First Amendment,"" he told us this week. The courts eventually ruled that the planned demonstration was protected speech, but the Nazis ended up holding their rally in Chicago instead.

David Goldberger, who is now professor emeritus at The Ohio State University's law school, found the case personally painful. He himself is Jewish.

Ted Clark grew up around the world, as the child of a US diplomat, living in Holland, Morrocco, and South Africa. His steadiness, fairness, and decency often made me think when he was NPR's Diplomatic Correspondent that Ted could show some members of the foreign service what real diplomacy sounds like. Ted Clark died last week, at the age of 79.

Ted came to NPR in its scrappy, early years, produced All Things Considered, then covered the White House and State Department before helping lead the International Desk. Longtime correspondent Sylvia Poggioli said he was, ""a masterful editor, gentle, patient soul, and steely defender of reporters against bureaucratic managers.""

Editor Martha Wexler called Ted ""the gentlest soul at NPR, who nurtured reporters and helped them do their very best work."" Reporter and editor Brenda Wilson said, ""He had a way of accommodating those who didn't fit the mold of whatever establishment where he landed.""

Julie McCarthy, who covered so much of the world for NPR, recalled Ted Clark as ""that rare creature who combined collaboration, kindness, and a steely determination to get it right — with a dollop of poetry thrown in.""

Ted and I came to NPR at about the same time, but I didn't know this story until this week:

Producer Neenah Ellis and Ted went to Mozambique in 1990 to report on children who had been separated from their families during the civil war.

""Ted interviewed children,"" Neenah told us. ""He was so good at that. We met a 10-year-old boy named Manicu Vashku. He was so small and quiet and wide eyed and sweet. Ted took to him immediately. The story Ted wrote about our trip was spare and matter of fact and kept returning to the children: how silent they were, how confused they seemed, how obedient they were.""

Their story, by the way, would win a Peabody Award.

Ted and Neenah joined workers from Save the Children as they brought Manicu to his aunt, in a village shattered by war.

A spoken-word intro by actor Giancarlo Esposito primes you for something heavy, but you are instantly reminded, of course, that this is a De La Soul album: it seems practically impossible that their brand of lackadaisical, perpetually sunny plunderphonics could ever feel like a drag. The lush strings of Yuhdontstop introduce an album that’s always projected in full-saturation Technicolor: from the effervescent Natalie Cole sample on Will Be to Maseo’s jovial, avuncular ad-libs that open Cruel Summers Bring Fire Life!!, Cabin in the Sky feels warm and rich in vitamin D, a tonic for chillier months.

For the most part, the afterlife theme seems to have been tacked on, likely after Trugoy’s death; the album still features his vocals, and most of the songs on the album fit squarely in De La Soul’s already established surrealist world. (Patty Cake, a minimalist highlight, reinterprets classic schoolyard chants, a conceit that somehow hasn’t already been done on a De La Soul record.) Even so, lasting more than 70 minutes, Cabin in the Sky can feel like a slog, with the end lacking the sprightliness of the album’s first half. An exception is the title track, on which Maseo and Pos pay tribute to Trugoy and others they’ve lost.

NBC News Think,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/woman-set-ablaze-chicago-transit-train-identified-rcna245669,Woman set ablaze on Chicago transit train is identified,"Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has identified the young woman who was set on fire last week while she was riding a Chicago Transit Authority train as Bethany MaGee, 26.

Duffy, in a post on X, also blamed ""Chicago’s carelessness"" for the attack, saying it would have never happened had the suspect ""been behind bars.""

""Yet Chicago lets repeat offenders roam the streets,"" Duffy wrote.

The suspect, Lawrence Reed, 50, has a history of mental illness and has been arrested 72 times since he turned 18, most recently in August, when he was charged with aggravated battery after a social worker was struck, Chicago media reported.

Over the objections of state prosecutors, Reed was released and put on electronic monitoring. Since then, he has violated the terms of his probation a half-dozen times, including the day of the attack, NBC Chicago reported.

Mayor Brandon Johnson on Monday said he would not confirm the woman's identity ""out of respect for the family's wishes.""

""This was a tragic incident, and the Mayor's prayers are with the victim and her family,"" he said in a statement.

At a news conference last week, Johnson said the Nov. 17 attack""should have never happened"" and characterized the violence as ""an absolute failure of our criminal justice as well as our mental health institutions.""

He said the suspect was clearly mentally disturbed and a danger to himself and the community — ""and now we have a woman who is fighting for her life,"" the mayor said.

President Donald Trump and members of his administration have routinely claimed that cities run by Democrats, like Johnson, have high crime rates.

When NBC News reached out to the Chicago Police Department to confirm Duffy's naming of MaGee, a spokesperson emailed that ""our office does not identify victims.""

There was also no immediate response from MaGee's family to Duffy's announcement. Calls to a phone number believed to belong to her family went unanswered.

Last week the family of the victim, who is being cared for at Stroger Hospital, released a statement that thanked ""everyone for their prayers and well-wishes as our daughter receives care for injuries sustained earlier this week.”

Duffy's post Sunday appeared several days after federal prosecutors charged Reed with one count of committing a terrorist attack or other violence against a mass transportation system in the Northern District of Illinois.

At the court hearing Wednesday, Reed repeatedly yelled “I plead guilty!” as soon as he entered the courtroom, according to NBC Chicago.

Reed declined counsel and tried to drown out the judge by singing out loud. The judge and the prosecutor agreed Reed should have a mental evaluation.

If he is convicted, Reed faces a maximum penalty of life in prison.

The woman was attacked just before 9:30 p.m. a week ago on a CTA blue line train.

Security video captured the man authorities identified as Reed holding a bottle and approaching the victim, who was sitting with her back to him. It showed him suddenly pouring a liquid over her head and trying to ignite it.

The woman, according to the complaint, fought him off and then ran toward the front of the train car with the man chasing after her.

The man quickly caught up with her and set the woman ablaze, the complaint said. He then “stood watching” as “her body was engulfed in flames.""

The woman was “almost fully engulfed in flames” and tried to roll to put out the blaze, the complaint said.",2025-11-25 01:28:08.622000+00:00,irony,"Ironic quotes around ""been behind bars."" with negative context",irony,figurative,1,figurative,0.0013134568,0.9986865,0.9986865,True

He widens his lens a bit on this one, examining why the past 25 years in culture has felt so stuck in the mud, arguing that we (as a culture) favor profit and ""going viral"" over any actual cultural innovation. Marx isn't the type of writer to only throw down purely an ""old man yells at cloud"" screed, though, so it'll be interesting to see what arguments he has to promote actual reinvention.

NBC News Think,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-democrats-sedition-death-threat-military-rcna245156,"Trump says he wasn't threatening Democrats he accused of 'seditious behavior, punishable by death'","WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said Friday that he’s “not threatening death” toward a group of Democratic members of Congress whom he accused of committing “seditious behavior,” which he said a day earlier was “punishable by death.”

“In the old days, if you said a thing like that, that was punishable by death,” Trump said in an interview Friday on conservative Brian Kilmeade’s radio show when asked to clarify what he meant.

The president's latest remarks come after he lodged the accusation and warning Thursday after Democratic lawmakers, many of whom are veterans, released a video urging members of the military and intelligence community not to follow illegal orders.

Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, who previously worked at the CIA and Defense Department, on Tuesday shared the video of herself and other former members of the military and intelligence community.

“This administration is pitting our uniformed military and intelligence community professionals against American citizens. Like us, you all swore an oath to protect and defend this Constitution. Right now, the threats coming to our Constitution aren’t just coming from abroad but from right here at home. Our laws are clear. You can refuse illegal orders. You must refuse illegal orders,” they said. “No one has to carry out orders that violate the law or our Constitution.”

The other participants included Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Reps. Chris Deluzio of Pennsylvania, Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire, Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania and Jason Crow of Colorado.

Trump responded to their video message in multiple posts on Truth Social, including one where he said, “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!” He also reposted other posts such as one that said, “Hang them George Washington would.”

The president denied that he threatened the members of Congress: “I think they’re in serious trouble. I would say they’re in serious trouble. I’m not threatening death, but I think they’re in serious trouble. In the old days, it was death. That was seditious behavior.”

Asked to respond to Trump's latest comments Friday, Slotkin's office referred to remarks she made Thursday night on MS NOW, saying that she received threats instantaneously and Capitol Police told her she'd be put on 24/7 security.

""We’ve got law enforcement out in front of my house,"" she said. ""It changes things immediately. And leadership climate is set from the top. And if the president is saying you should be hanged, then we shouldn’t be surprised when folks on the ground are going to follow suit and say even worse.""

Crow said in a statement Friday evening that ""Trump's Truth Social posts threatening to execute Democratic Members of Congress speak for themselves.""

“No matter his attempts to silence and intimidate me, I will not back down from my lifetime oath to uphold and defend the Constitution,” he said.

Kelly, Deluzio, Houlahan and Goodlander didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment in response to Trump’s assertion Friday that he wasn’t threatening death.

Trump said that the lawmakers who appeared in the video “broke the law,” and added, “I can say if I ever said that and there were a Democrat as president, all hell would have broken loose. And it has broken loose.” The president said that he believes Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is investigating the situation.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt rejected the idea Thursday that the president was calling for members of Congress to be executed. “No,” she said when asked that question, later adding that the Democrats’ comments are “a very, very dangerous message and it perhaps is punishable by law. I’m not a lawyer. I’ll leave that to the Department of Justice and the Department of War to decide.”

Threats and violence against public officials have surged in recent years, including the two attempted assassinations of Trump while he was campaigning for president last year. A recent NBC News poll found that more than 6 in 10 registered voters said they thought “extreme political rhetoric” contributed in the September assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., who said Thursday he wouldn't have used the same language as Trump, was asked Friday about the rise in threats against people serving in elected office and whether Trump has a responsibility to tone down the heated rhetoric.

“I don’t think you can put the blame on the president for any of that,” Johnson told reporters. “The rhetoric is heated all the way around. We’ve had Democrats throughout this Congress who have in essence encouraged political violence against the president himself, against Republicans. I’ve been calling on people to turn down the rhetoric across the board, everywhere, throughout the institutions. It’s a dangerous time.”

Crow, who served in the Army, told reporters on Capitol Hill on Friday that he was receiving more threats since Trump’s posts. His office has formally requested that the U.S. Capitol Police investigate the president’s posts, referring to them as “intimidating, threatening, and concerning,” according to a copy of the email reviewed by NBC News.

“I write to report threats made by the President of the United States, Donald J. Trump, against Congressman Jason Crow,” Crow’s office begins the email, which outlined the Truth Social posts and said his offices have received “a significant uptick in calls and emails with violent rhetoric and additional threats.” Axios first reported the letter. Capitol Police doesn’t typically comment on potential investigations, but requesting a probe into the sitting president is a long shot.

“You know, when the president of the United States tweets out death threats and says the things that he says that, you know, that stirs things up a lot,” Crow said Friday. “But again, I’m not going to be incredibly intimidated, and certainly not going to change my approach.”

Sen. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., who served in the Marines, told NBC News he has seen an uptick in online vitriol since the president's comments on sedition.

“Clearly the president knew exactly what he was doing, trying to turn his online digital mob against these members of Congress,” he said in an interview Friday, while in Chicago to talk to small businesses about the impact of recent immigration operations.

“The fact is that, what they’re [Democrats are] saying is very much what you do when you join the military. ... You should not follow any orders that are illegal, very simple,"" he added. ""And the fact that he took it so personally tells you, tells me he just didn’t understand the military. He thinks that they’re his toy. They’re not there to protect the Constitution United States.”",2025-11-21 23:36:10.127000+00:00,literal,Factual reporting on reporting and data,literal,literal,0,figurative,0.38757926,0.61242074,0.61242074,False
Al Jazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/24/israel-kills-four-palestinians-as-attacks-continue-despite-gaza-ceasefire,Israel kills four Palestinians in Gaza; fighters recover body of captive,"Israeli forces have killed at least four Palestinians and wounded several others across Gaza despite a six-week ceasefire, as a Palestinian armed group announced recovering the body of another captive in the war-torn territory.

The victims on Monday included a Palestinian man who was killed in a drone attack in the southern town of Bani Suheila, in an area controlled by Israeli forces beyond the so-called “yellow line”.

Separately, a Palestinian child was also killed in northern Gaza City when ordnances left behind by Israeli forces exploded, according to the territory’s civil defence.

The group said several more children were wounded, with some in critical condition.

Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum, reporting from Gaza City, said Israeli attacks also continued throughout the day, with artillery, air raids and helicopter strikes reported in both northern and southern parts of the enclave.

In Beit Lahiya, Israeli fire hit areas outside the yellow line. In the south, tanks and helicopters targeted territory northeast of Rafah and the outskirts of Khan Younis.

“There are extensive Israeli attacks beyond the yellow line that have led to the systematic destruction of Gaza’s eastern neighbourhoods,” Abu Azzoum said.

Testimonies gathered by families, he added, point to a “systematic attempt to destroy Gaza’s neighbourhoods and create buffer zones, making these areas completely uninhabitable, which complicates a return for families”.

In central Gaza, civil defence teams, operating with police and Red Cross support, recovered the bodies of eight members of a single family from the rubble of their home in the Maghazi camp, the Palestinian Wafa news agency reported, which was struck in an earlier Israeli attack.

The Gaza Government Media Office said the number of bodies retrieved since the ceasefire began has now reached 582, while more than 9,500 Palestinians remain missing beneath the ruins of bombed-out districts.

Captive’s body recovered

The Palestinian Islamic Jihad, an armed group allied with Hamas, meanwhile, announced it had recovered the body of an Israeli captive in Nuseirat camp in central Gaza.

If the body is identified, two more will have to be recovered under the first phase of the Gaza ceasefire deal. Israel is supposed to return the bodies of 15 Palestinians in exchange for each captive’s body.

Hamas has previously said the widespread destruction has hampered efforts to locate the remaining bodies.

Also on Monday, the GHF, a US-backed entity that operated parallel to United Nations aid structures, announced the end of its activities in Gaza.

The organisation cited provisions in the October ceasefire as the reason for its withdrawal.

UN experts say at least 859 Palestinians were killed around GHF distribution points since May 2025, with Israeli forces and foreign contractors regularly opening fire on crowds desperately seeking food.

The scheme drew widespread condemnation for bypassing established humanitarian channels.

Israeli attacks on the West Bank

Across the occupied West Bank, Israeli forces stepped up raids overnight, arresting at least 16 Palestinians, according to Wafa. Arrests were reported in Iktaba near Tulkarem, in Tuqu southeast of Bethlehem, in Kobar near Ramallah, and in Silat al-Harithiya west of Jenin.

Israeli troops also detained residents in Tubas and the surrounding areas.

Violence escalated further on Sunday night when Israeli forces killed a 20-year-old law student, Baraa Khairi Ali Maali, in Deir Jarir, north of Ramallah.

Wafa reported that clashes erupted after Israeli settlers attacked Palestinian homes on the village’s outskirts. Fathi Hamdan, head of the local council, said troops entered the village to protect the settlers, then opened fire on Palestinians confronting them.

Maali suffered a gunshot wound to the chest and died shortly after arrival at hospital. His killing follows the fatal shooting of another young man by settlers in Deir Jarir last month.

Elsewhere in the West Bank, Israeli soldiers injured two Palestinian women and detained two brothers during a raid in Kafr Qaddum, east of Qalqilya.

Settler attacks also continued. Fires were set on agricultural land between Atara and Birzeit, north of Ramallah, destroying farmland belonging to residents.

In a separate incident in Atara, settlers from a newly established outpost torched olive trees and stole farming equipment.

Israeli settler violence has surged over the past two years; since October 7, 2023, at least 1,081 Palestinians have been killed in the occupied West Bank by Israeli forces and settlers, including 223 children, with more than 10,614 wounded and more than 20,500 arrested.

Israeli ceasefire violations in Lebanon

In Lebanon, Hezbollah held a funeral for senior commander Haytham Ali Tabatabai, assassinated by Israel on Sunday.

Images from Beirut’s southern suburbs showed mourners carrying his coffin, wrapped in yellow and green, as Hezbollah flags lined the streets. The group has not yet announced how it will respond.

Mahmoud Qmati, vice president of Hezbollah’s Political Council, called the killing “yet another ceasefire violation”, accusing Israel of escalating the conflict “with the green light given by the United States”.

Security analyst Ali Rizk said Hezbollah is weighing its options carefully, warning that the group is unlikely to “give Netanyahu an excuse to launch an all-out war against Lebanon”, which he said could be more devastating than the current limited exchanges.

Geopolitical analyst Joe Macaron said the US is “no longer restraining Israel” and is instead supporting Israeli operations in Syria, Gaza and Lebanon.

Reporting from Beirut, Al Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr said that Hezbollah, in turn, faces a strategic dilemma: retaliation could risk a massive Israeli assault, yet inaction could erode its deterrence.

Imad Salamey of the Lebanese American University said any Hezbollah response could be met with a “severe” Israeli reaction.

Speaking to Al Jazeera, he added that Israel’s right-wing government “is eager to escalate because escalation will serve that government staying in power”.

Salamey argued that Hezbollah’s deterrence capacity has been “severely damaged” and that the group “no longer has the support it used to have or the logistical routes it used to utilise via Syria”.",2025-11-24 00:00:00,metaphor,Tanking used as metaphor for failing badly,metaphor,figurative,1,literal,0.93051225,0.06948772,0.93051225,False
Al Jazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/17/how-many-times-has-the-us-struck-venezuelan-vessels,How many times has the US struck Venezuelan vessels?,"There have been at least six incidents of US strikes on boats in Venezuelan waters since the beginning of September.

On Thursday, the United States military carried out its latest strike on an alleged Venezuela drug smuggling vessel, as the admiral overseeing the Trump administration’s controversial campaign in the Caribbean Sea announced his early departure.

Officials did not offer additional details about the incident, in which they said there were some survivors — unlike the previous boat bombings.

US Secretary of War Pete Hegseth posted on X that Admiral Alvin Holsey of the Southern Command would be retiring at the end of the year, less than a year into the post, which is usually three years long.

The latest attack on a boat came a day after United States President Donald Trump confirmed that he authorised the CIA to carry out secret operations in Venezuela and suggested that he was mulling a land attack, too.

Trump told a reporter that he authorised the CIA to go into Venezuela because there are “a lot of drugs coming in from Venezuela, and a lot of the Venezuelan drugs come in through the sea, so you get to see that, but we’re going to stop them by land also”.

In a TV address on Wednesday, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro cautioned against further escalation, objecting to “failed regime changes … carried out by the CIA”.

So, how many Venezuelan boats has the US struck so far, how deadly have they been, and what troops has the Trump administration sent to the Caribbean Sea as it threatens the Maduro government in Venezuela?

How many vessels have been attacked so far?

The US has carried out at least six strikes on boats in Venezuelan waters since the start of September, killing some 27 people, after allegations that they were carrying narcotics.

However, the Trump administration has failed to provide evidence that the targeted boats were carrying narcotics bound for the US.

September 2

The US military killed 11 people in a strike on a vessel from Venezuela allegedly carrying illegal narcotics, Trump said on September 2. It was the first known operation since the US’s deployment of warships to the southern Caribbean.

Trump shared aerial footage of the bombing on his Truth Social account, stating, “Earlier this morning, on my Orders, U.S. Military Forces conducted a kinetic strike against positively identified Tren de Aragua Narcoterrorists in the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility. TDA is a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization, operating under the control of Nicolas Maduro, responsible for mass murder, drug trafficking, sex trafficking, and acts of violence and terror across the United States and Western Hemisphere.”

September 15

On September 15, Trump confirmed that three people had been killed by a US military strike on another Venezuelan vessel. He took to his Truth Social account to say that the operation had positively identified drug trafficking cartels. The post was accompanied by a video which appeared to show the boat exploding on the water.

September 19

This marked the third fatal attack on a vessel allegedly smuggling drugs. Trump posted on social media that the strike had killed three people who were affiliated with a designated terrorist organisation.

October 3

On October 3, the US government confirmed that four people had been killed when its forces destroyed a boat allegedly involved in drug trafficking on the high seas not far from Venezuela.

October 14

In its latest operation, the US killed six people on board a boat in international waters near the Venezuelan coast, Trump confirmed on social media on Tuesday.

In his post, he wrote, “Intelligence confirmed the vessel was trafficking narcotics, was associated with illicit narcoterrorist networks, and was transiting along a known route for smuggling.”

October 16

In Thursday’s attack on the suspected drug vessel, there were survivors, unlike the previous strikes. Unlike previous attacks on boats, US officials have not posted photos of the attack.

It is unclear whether US forces offered medical help to the survivors, whether they were captured, or where they are now.

Is the US breaking international law?

Human Rights Watch (HRW) has said the maritime strikes amount to “extrajudicial killings”.

“US officials cannot summarily kill people they accuse of smuggling drugs,” said Sarah Yager, Washington director at HRW. “The problem of narcotics entering the United States is not an armed conflict, and US officials cannot circumvent their human rights obligations by pretending otherwise.”

The use of military force against foreign ships in international waters is considered unlawful unless a clear legal exception applies. In a letter to Congress on September 4 Trump cited the right to self-defence as justification for the US’s actions at sea.

Coastal countries like Venezuela control the waters within 12 nautical miles (22km) of their shores, known as territorial waters, where they have full sovereignty. Beyond that, they can claim up to 200 nautical miles (370km) as an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).

Under the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), all states enjoy freedom of navigation and overflight on the high seas, which lie beyond any nation’s control. Ships there fall under the jurisdiction of the country whose flag they fly, except when involved in piracy or other illegal acts.

Where are US ships deployed?

In August, Washington started deploying warships just outside Venezuelan waters.

On August 14, the US Fleet Forces Command published a news release stating sailors and Marines assigned to the Iwo Jima Amphibious Ready Group had departed from Norfolk, Virginia and Camp Lejeune, North Carolina.

According to the latest United States Southern Command – one of 11 unified combatant commands of the Department of Defense responsible for Latin America, Central America, the Caribbean, and surrounding waters – various strike packages and naval assets are in proximity to Venezuela.

Additionally, air and naval assets, including Reaper drones, Poseidon aircraft, amphibious transport docks and strike packages, are stationed around the coast of Puerto Rico.",2025-10-17 00:00:00,literal,Factual reporting on reporting and policy,literal,literal,0,literal,0.8701634,0.12983662,0.8701634,True
NBC News Think,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/morgan-geyser-slender-man-stabbing-missing-wisconsin-rcna245505,Woman convicted in 'Slender Man' stabbing apprehended in Illinois after cutting off monitoring bracelet,"The woman convicted of brutally stabbing her sixth-grade classmate to please the fictional horror character ""Slender Man"" was apprehended in Illinois after having left her Wisconsin group home with a 43-year-old man, officials said.

Morgan Geyser, 23, cut off her Department of Corrections monitoring bracelet and left the group home Saturday night, the Madison Police Department said.

Police said they were notified at 10:34 p.m. Sunday that Geyser was taken into custody in Illinois. The Posen Police Department said officers were dispatched to Thornton's Truck Stop for a report of a man and a woman ""loitering behind the building.""

When officers arrived, they found people sleeping on the sidewalk, Posen police said.

""The female repeatedly refused to provide her real name and initially gave a false one,"" Posen police said in a statement. ""After continued attempts to identify her, she finally stated that she didn’t want to tell officers who she was because she had 'done something really bad,' and suggested that officers could 'just Google' her name.""

Once she provided her true identity, however, police confirmed she was Geyser. Posen police said in a statement that the man with Geyser was also taken into custody.

A police report identified the man with Geyser as Chad Mecca, 43, who did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It's unclear whether he has an attorney.

According to the report, Geyser told officers that she felt she was treated unfairly at her group home and that she was ""upset that Chad was not allowed to visit her."" She added that the man had snuck in through her window on multiple occasions to see her at the group home.

""When asked about her ankle monitor she stated that she cut it off with scissors and that she and Chad discussed potentially making their way to Nashville, Tennessee,"" the report said.

Geyser appeared in court Monday and was ordered to be detained at the Cook County Jail. The Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office said in a statement that an out-of-state warrant from Wisconsin was executed, and her next court date is Tuesday in Chicago.

Waukesha County District Attorney Lesli Boese told reporters that her office does not have jurisdiction in Geyser’s case as her group home is in a different county. The decision to charge Geyser in relation with the escape would fall to officials in Dane County, according to Boese.

Dane County District Attorney’s Ismael R. Ozanne told NBC News that the case is still under investigation by the Madison Police Department and has not yet been referred to his office.

A petition to revoke Geyser's conditional release in light of recent events would have to be filed by the state, which Boese said her office ""fully"" supports. Geyser would be returned to full-time institutionalized care if her release were to be revoked.

""Not only should she have been in custody from 2014 forward, but also, attorney [Abbey] Nickolie argued vehemently for her not to be released to conditional release in I believe it was January of this year,"" Boese told reporters.

Wisconsin's Department of Health Services noted that Geyser is considered a patient and therefore protected by patient privacy laws, limiting its ability to comment on her case. The Department of Corrections is similarly limited, it added.

In an update earlier Sunday night, police included a tentative timeline covering Geyser's departure. The department said it was not notified of Geyser’s status until officers were dispatched to the group home Sunday morning based on a 911 call.

About 8:15 p.m. Saturday: Geyser was last seen at the group home.

Geyser was last seen at the group home. About 9:30 p.m.: The Department of Corrections was alerted that Geyser’s location tracker had malfunctioned.

Someone from the home called 911 to report Geyser had vanished, characterizing her as a missing person. 7:58 a.m.: Madison police were sent to investigate the missing person report.

The dispatch was ""the first time the Madison Police Department was made aware that Geyser was missing,” the police department said.

The police department also said it did not receive the Department of Corrections' request for law enforcement to apprehend Geyser.

A judge ruled in January that Geyser should be released from a psychiatric hospital. She had spent nearly seven years in the Winnebago Mental Health Institute and was then moved to a group home.

Geyser was 15 when she was sentenced to a maximum of 40 years in a mental hospital for the 2014 stabbing attack. She and another girl lured their classmate Payton Leutner to a suburban Milwaukee park and attacked the girl, with Geyser stabbing her.

At the time, all three girls were 12 years old, and the victim barely survived.

Geyser and her classmate believed they had to attack the victim or risk having Slender Man, the fictional boogeyman, come after their families, defense lawyers said at the time.

Anthony Cotton, Geyser's attorney, shared a video statement Sunday on social media urging Geyser to turn herself in.

""We just heard the news that Morgan has walked away from the group home that she was housed at. Obviously it’s in her best interest to turn herself in immediately and not continue with this course of action,"" he said. ""If anybody has contact with Morgan, hears from her, or if Morgan happens to see this, turn yourself in. Do not continue to remain on the run like this.""

Leutner’s family said they were aware of Geyser’s disappearance.

“Payton and her family are safe and are working closely with local law enforcement to ensure their continued safety. The family would like to thank all of the law enforcement entities involved in the efforts to apprehend Morgan,” the statement said. “The Leutner family also wish to thank the outpouring of support from family, friends, and well-wishers who have contacted them during this difficult time.”

Police did not give more information about the group home Geyser left. The Department of Corrections has multiple programs for post-prison rehabilitation, drug treatment and supervision of those ""conditionally released from mental health facilities,"" according to the website for the department's Division of Community Corrections.",2025-11-24 21:56:06.287000+00:00,irony,"Ironic quotes around "" posen police said in a statement.

The death of every child is its own disaster.

But there has been something especially poignant in the stories of the campers, counselors, and staff from Camp Mystic who died last week in the Guadalupe River's floodwaters.

We think of the years that should have been ahead of them, filled with laughter, learning, friends, new adventures, fun, frustration, love and heartbreak and love again.

Hanna and Rebecca Lawrence were twin sisters who had just finished second grade. Their parents said in a statement, ""We are devastated that the bond we shared with them, and that they shared with each other, is now frozen in time.""

Mary Grace Baker had just celebrated her first Communion. St. Anne Catholic school in Beaumont, Texas, said on Facebook, ""Her giggle was contagious, as was her spirit.""

Eloise Peck and Lila Bonner were 8 and 9 years old. Eloise's mother, Missy Peck, told KDFW-TV that Eloise — known as Lulu — ""loved spaghetti but not more than she loved dogs and animals. She passed away alongside her best friend and cabinmate.""

Chloe Childress was 18, and a fourth-generation Camp Mystic camper, back this summer as a counselor. The head of her Houston school said in a statement, ""Chloe made space for others to feel safe, valued, and brave.""

Families who send their children off to summer camp miss them every day. But they also feel that being away, nestled into nature, will shelter their children and help them grow.

Cody Crossman wrote a post on Facebook about losing his 8 year old niece, Hadley Hanna. Each detail pierces your heart.

""Sweet Hadley, I can't believe it. The joy you brought everyone with your smile and laughter can't be replaced. I will miss our Monday dance Hopdoddy milkshakes and just that time we got to spend together. I will always remember the last time I saw you, the night before you left.

Video that’s made international news showed her being dragged by people her family believes worked for Ghana’s government.

The videos obtained by the NBC Washington I-Team are raising questions from her family about how people are treated after they are deported from the U.S. to countries other than their countries of origin.

As part of the Trump administration’s third-country deportation program, dozens of deportees have been sent from the U.S. to Africa since this summer, NBC News reported.

Rabbiatu Kuyateh, a 58-year-old mother and grandmother, moved to the D.C. area 30 years ago as she fled Sierra Leone’s civil war, said Mohamed Alghali, her son. He owns a home in Bowie with his mom, who he called his best friend.

“I felt defeated. Felt like I failed my mom,” he said.

Alghali was born in the U.S. and his family put down roots in the D.C. area. His grandparents joined them and became citizens. Kuyateh’s attorney says she was a nurse with a work permit but never became a citizen.

‘My heart just broke’

Alghali was required to check in every year with U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement.

Her check-in this July was different.

“They called her to the back. They said, ‘Yeah, Rabbiatu, you have a order of removal. So, we’re, you know, yeah, we’re detaining you,” her son said.

“I mean, my heart just broke,” he said.

Alghali was optimistic he would see his mother again. But he wouldn’t see her face-to-face. After several days at Maryland ICE’s temporary holding area, she was moved to an ICE facility in Louisiana, where she was held for months, her attorney said.

“I don’t think anyone expected her to be detained, just because nothing had changed with her circumstances,” attorney Hannah Bridges said.

Kuyateh’s attorney said Kuyateh was still in Louisiana in September when a judge granted an order saying she could not be sent back to Sierra Leone, where she said her client had been tortured.

Bridges said the U.S. immediately began exploring other countries to send her to, which the attorney tried to fight in court with requests for hearings.

“Those requests went unacknowledged,” Bridges said.

Kuyateh’s civil rights have been violated, her attorney said.

“She should have been given notice and an opportunity to seek protection from removal to a third country, and the government had multiple opportunities to do this,” Bridges said.

Rabbiatu Kuyateh says she was flown to Ghana in shackles

Earlier this month, Kuyateh was flown from the U.S. to Ghana, a country she said she had never been to.

Alghali called his mother while the I-Team was with him. She said as she was flown from the U.S. to Ghana, her wrists and ankles were shackled for the entire 10-hour flight. Some had it even worse, she said.

“There was another guy on the floor. That guy, they chained from the head. Down to the feet,” Kuyateh said. “They said if you don’t cooperate with us, that’s how we’re going to tie you.”

Kuyateh told the I-Team she and other deportees were sent to a hotel in Ghana. She said she was there for six days before video captured her being dragged.

A bus arrived to take Kuyateh to Sierra Leone — though a U.S. judge had ordered that she could not be sent there. She told News4 she resisted.

“That’s when they dragged me. So, they bumped the back of my head,” Kuyateh said.

The I-Team obtained multiple videos of the dragging, which were sent to her family and provided to News4.

Kuyateh said she believes the people on video in green uniforms worked for Ghana’s government.

Photos show some of the injuries Kuyateh said she sustained from being dragged.

The video went viral overseas, and several media outlets in West Africa reported that the Sierra Leone High Commission, which is like its embassy in Ghana, said it’s aware of what happened and will investigate.

NBC Washington asked the Ministry of the Interior for Ghana about this. They acknowledged our email but did not answer our questions. We received no response from Sierra Leone officials.

‘I consider America my home’

Kuyateh said she’s safe for now in an undisclosed location in Sierra Leone. But she wants to be with her family.

“I consider America my home. It’s like, I built relationships there,” she said.

In the home she owns in Bowie, her family asked what her future would hold and if she would ever return. The I-Team asked her son if she felt that the U.S. had failed his mom.

“Yes, one hundred percent. I felt like they’ve been failing her,” Alghali said.

The I-Team reached out to ICE in Maryland for comment several days ago. They asked that we share our videos of Kuyateh being dragged, which we did. They still have not responded to our questions about her case.

In September, the U.S. Department of Justice argued in federal court that it had no power to control how another country treats deportees. It said that Ghana had pledged to the U.S. that it wouldn’t send deportees back to their home countries.

The United Nations human rights office has called on Ghana to stop deporting people from the U.S. to their home countries if U.S. courts have said it’s dangerous for them to return.

Kuyateh was the primary caregiver for her mother and father. She told the I-Team she’s worried about who will take care of them now. When she was detained in the U.S., she thought she was being released to head back to Maryland when she was forced to board the flight to Ghana.

Al Jazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/22/who-are-the-95-palestinian-healthcare-workers-held-captive-by-israel,Who are the 95 Palestinian healthcare workers held captive by Israel?,"Israel continues to hold 80 Palestinian doctors and medical workers from Gaza and 15 from the occupied West Bank.

More doctors and healthcare professionals are mobilising and calling for action to demand the release of Dr Hussam Abu Safia and at least 94 other Palestinian medics currently held captive by Israeli authorities.

On Monday, in an event organised by Healthcare Workers Watch (HWW) and Amnesty International UK, doctors and healthcare workers protested outside St Thomas’ Hospital in central London, calling for the immediate and unconditional release of all the detained healthcare workers currently held in appalling conditions in Israel.

The protest comes just days after an Israeli court extended Abu Safia’s arbitrary detention for another six months under the widely condemned Unlawful Combatants Law.

A further five healthcare workers have died or been killed while in Israeli detention, and five more are missing, their whereabouts unknown. According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, at least 1,722 healthcare workers have been killed in Israeli strikes in the past two years.

According to HWW, most healthcare workers were abducted by the Israeli military from their hospitals or ambulances while they were on duty. Testimonies collected by HWW and other organisations catalogue the torture and abuse that Palestinians endure in Israeli detention.

Dr Rebecca Inglis, of HWW, says: “Israel’s continued detention of nearly one hundred healthcare workers is in clear contravention of International Humanitarian Law. We are gravely concerned for their welfare given the extensive evidence that Palestinian detainees are being tortured while in Israeli detention.”

Who is Dr Hussam Abu Safia?

Abu Safia, the director of Kamal Adwan Hospital in North Gaza, was arrested by Israeli forces on December 27, 2024, after troops raided the hospital, which at the time was one of the last functioning medical facilities in the region.

Amnesty International says that the hospital director has been held without charge or trial under an Israeli security law.

Despite relentless bombardment and the tragic death of his own son in an Israeli air strike, Abu Safia remained on duty, caring for patients and leading his team through unimaginable conditions.

Since his detention, credible reports have emerged of torture, physical abuse and degrading treatment, including suffering significant weight loss and the denial of adequate medical care, hygiene and timely access to legal counsel – in clear violation of international law.

Israel’s systematic attack on Gaza’s health infrastructure

At least 94 percent of hospitals in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed, with many no longer operational. In addition to this, skilled doctors and healthcare workers have been killed, and paired with the detention of healthcare workers – most of whom were detained while working within hospitals and healthcare facilities – it has added to the immense pressure on Gaza’s vulnerable health system.

Between October 7, 2023, to October 20, 2025, HWW documented a total of 431 cases of detained Palestinian healthcare workers.

As of October 20, 2025:

309 of the 431 detained healthcare workers are now confirmed to have been released; of which 67 were released as part of the latest exchange deal on October 13

Five healthcare workers are still missing (three senior physicians, an UNRWA pharmacist and a senior physiotherapist)

Five HCWs have reportedly been killed or died in Israeli detention, however, their bodies have not been returned to their families.

HWW has said it has not yet received an update from the families of 22 detained healthcare workers, who are not included in the “confirmed detained” or “confirmed released” figures.

Who are the other healthcare professionals being held?

The healthcare professionals still detained by Israel have spent an average of 511 days in detention, with some held captive since the early weeks of the war.

Of the 95 being held, 80 are from Gaza, while the remaining 15 are from the occupied West Bank.

From Gaza alone, 31 nurses have been detained, followed by 17 physicians, 15 hospital support and management staff, 14 paramedics, two pharmacists and one medical technician. Twenty-five held senior positions, 50 occupied mid-level positions, while five were junior healthcare workers. All except one are male.

Most of the healthcare workers lived in North Gaza, with 36 of the prisoners from there, followed by 24 from Khan Younis, 18 from Gaza City and 3 from Rafah.

NBC News Think,https://www.nbcnews.com/world/russia/teen-street-musician-became-face-kremlins-crackdown-rcna244316,How a teen street musician became the face of the Kremlin's crackdown,"Dozens of young people wave their phone flashlights and sing along with a teen as she belts out lyrics and plays her keyboard outside a subway station.

It’s a scene that regularly plays out in cities around the world. But the singer in this widely shared video is now behind bars.

Diana Loginova, the 18-year-old student and street musician, has emerged as an unlikely — and perhaps unwilling — voice of defiance in wartime Russia.

Known by her stage name Naoko, the teen gained popularity over the summer with viral videos taken around St. Petersburg of her band Stoptime performing songs by musicians who have spoken out against Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine. Inevitably, in a country where nearly all forms of dissent have been crushed, Russian authorities quickly took notice.

Naoko was first detained last month for organizing a “mass simultaneous gathering of citizens” during a performance, which authorities said disrupted public order, and was sentenced to 13 days behind bars. She has since been rearrested twice on the same charges, as well as for petty hooliganism, and put back in prison. Her fellow band members have also served back-to-back sentences, although one has since been released.

“What is happening is what we call carousel arrests,” Dmitrii Anisimov, a human rights activist and spokesperson for the OVD-Info protest monitoring group, told NBC News. “Theoretically, it can continue forever,” he said. In practice, it could mean months in detention, and there is legal precedent for this, he added.

“It looks like Russian authorities want to use the persecution of Naoko, as with many other public cases, to intimidate others,” said Anisimov.

Loginova’s lawyer, Maria Zyryanova, told NBC News she wouldn’t discuss the case while the singer is behind bars. Her current sentence expires Sunday.

Naoko’s case has been extensively covered by Russian state news agencies and exiled independent media, while supporters have spread leaflets calling for her freedom.

In an interview published in August, months before her imprisonment, Naoko said she was “scared” to be detained but felt she “had to do it.”

“I understand that art is now the only language — at least in Russia — through which you can express your thoughts. I’ve chosen it and don’t want to speak any other,” she told St. Petersburg news outlet Bumaga.

Others have taken up that language in Loginova’s absence.

On a bench near the Kiyevskaya metro station in central Moscow, musician Vasily told NBC News that Naoko’s case had “lit a fire” in him, inspiring his own street performances as a way to support the jailed singer.

“Her freedom was taken away for her singing,” said Vasily, whose last name NBC News chose not to reveal for his safety. “That got me mad.”

Valentina, a professional musician from the city of Yaroslavl, about 380 miles southeast of St. Petersburg, has been singing on both the streets and social media in support of Naoko.

Inspired after seeing Naoko’s performances on TikTok, she has been posting videos where she performs the same songs. One gained more than 600,000 views on Instagram, which scared her because she did not want to get on authorities’ radar, said Valentina, who did not want her last name revealed for fear of repercussions. “When I saw the news about Naoko, it felt like my last hope was taken away,” she said. “I did not feel sorry for myself. I just really wanted to help. I thought, ‘Why do I berate people who keep silent and don’t say anything in our country when I am also remaining silent and scared?’”

Loginova is still a child, noted Vasily — himself only 19. “That’s what’s touched people, that this little girl is not afraid to get on the streets and sing the songs of foreign agents.”

He’s referencing the status of exiled singer Monetochka and rapper Noize MC, both slapped with the official designation often reserved for public figures whose views have set them at odds with the Kremlin.

It was a song by Noize MC, who has openly spoken out against the war and Putin’s regime, that Loginova performed before she first landed in jail.

The rapper’s lyrics that appear to have gotten her in the most trouble appear innocuous on the surface: “I want to watch a ballet, let the swans dance.”

It’s a reference to the failed 1991 coup attempt against the last Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, during which state TV showed the “Swan Lake” ballet on a continuous loop. It has since come to symbolize something dangerous in Putin’s Russia — change.

A video of the band’s cover of the song, which Loginova has said they performed rarely and not for the cameras, drew the ire of war supporters who questioned why the band was allowed to perform the songs of “traitors” and whether their performances were, in fact, concealed protests.

A representative for Noize MC said in an email that the rapper “prefers not to give interviews or public comments regarding this case — primarily to avoid any risk of unintentionally affecting those directly involved.”

Monetochka, whose songs the band also performed, hailed them as “heroes” in a statement on social media, saying that Loginova was bringing “music and freedom” into the world rather than “violence and war.” She did not respond to NBC News’ request for comment.

NBC News has reached out to Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov for comment on the case.

Kremlin critic Boris Nadezhdin, who was barred from running against Putin in last year’s election, said he had been in communication with Loginova’s mom, Irina, and was fundraising to cover the band’s legal costs.

He has also been raising awareness on social media and said people’s emotional reactions were palpable. “She is young, she is a female, and she is not at all a politician or journalist. People are used to repressions against opposition politicians and journalists, but this is a new low,” said Nadezhdin.

The people who came to listen to the band were also young, he added, a red flag for the Kremlin because of its predominantly older support base. “So they need to have an exemplary reprisal against some young singer,” he said, “so that others get fearful.”

While she garners sympathy at home and abroad, Loginova remains behind bars for her singing. Nadezhdin said he was not optimistic about her chances of performing again anytime soon.

“They won’t leave her alone quickly,” he said. “I am telling them to get ready for a long ride ahead.”",2025-11-22 11:43:27.619000+00:00,literal,Factual reporting on policy and elections,literal,literal,0,literal,0.86157274,0.13842727,0.86157274,True
The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/24/cop30-wrecked-fossil-fuels-russia-saudi-arabia-brazil#comments,Another Cop wrecked by fossil fuel interests and our leaders’ cowardice – but there is another way | Genevieve Guenther,"The 30th conference of the parties (Cop30), the annual climate summit of all nations party to the UNFCCC, just ended. Stakeholders are out in the media trying spin the outcome as a win. Simon Stiell, climate change executive secretary for the UN is, for instance, praising Cop30 for showing that “climate cooperation is alive and kicking, keeping humanity in the fight for a liveable planet”. But let us be clear. The conference was a failure. Its outcome, the decision text known as the Global Mutirão or Global Collective Effort, is, in essence, a form of climate denial.

In 2023, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) determined that the world had already developed, or planned to develop, too much fossil fuel to be able to halt global heating at 2C. It acknowledged that the capital assets built up around fossil fuels must be stranded – that is to say, abandoned and not used – if warming was to be limited to 2C. But the Cop30 decision text ignores all this. Indeed, it never even mentions fossil fuels.

This failure is all the more bitter because Cop30 had initially sent out so many hopeful signals that it would finally tackle the “transitioning away from fossil fuels” pledge from Cop28. Speaking ahead of the conference, the Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, said that the world needs “roadmaps that will enable humankind, in a fair and planned manner, to overcome its dependence on fossil fuels”.

Lula’s call was backed by about 90 other nations. “This is a global coalition, with global north and global south countries coming together and saying with one voice: this is an issue which cannot be swept under the carpet,” said the UK’s energy secretary, Ed Miliband.

After a press conference where 20 ministers and climate envoys demanded that the proposed language on the roadmap in the first draft text be “strengthened” and adopted, the EU circulated its own proposal for incorporating the roadmap in the final text.

By Friday, the number of countries supporting the roadmap to fossil-fuel phaseout rose to 89. Yet any reference to it disappeared from the second draft that dropped on the same day. Thanks to Cop30, the fossil fuel era will simply continue.

It seems clear that the petrostates, led by Russia and Saudi Arabia, fought against fossil fuel phaseout and won. If they feel the phaseout is an existential threat to their economies and their sovereignty, perhaps they should consider how the climate crisis is rendering the Middle East uninhabitable. The very week of Cop30, Iran’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, announced that Tehran, Iran’s capital city of 16 million, would need to be abandoned and re-established elsewhere, because, after years of climate-fuelled drought, its water has finally run out.

Surely these states are being supported in their fossil-fuel authoritarianism by Donald Trump, who is the president of the world’s largest producer of fossil fuels and who calls the climate crisis a “con job”. Even though the US was officially absent from the negotiations, Trump’s alliance with Saudi Arabia, and seeming affinity for Russia, underwrites their ability to advance their own energy interests.

Yet would this power be as great if the world’s “climate leaders” had more courage? It is remarkable that at the very moment the EU was supposedly fighting to include a roadmap to fossil fuel phaseout in the Cop decision, Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, was telling a press conference at the G20 that “we are not fighting fossil fuels, we are fighting the emissions from fossil fuels.” Not only does this statement directly undermine her own negotiators’ positions, it is in itself nonsensical – akin to saying “we are not giving up eating ice-cream, we are giving up absorbing the calories from that ice-cream.”

More to the point, von der Leyen’s language echoed nearly verbatim the words of Osama Faqeeha, deputy environment minister for Saudi Arabia, who told a journalist asking about the Cop30 roadmap that “the issue is the emissions, it’s not the fuel”. It has long been the position of the Saudis that the world could continue to use fossil fuels and simply remove the economy’s 600m metric tonnes of annual carbon-dioxide emissions with carbon-dioxide removal. But this is nothing more than fossil-fuel propaganda.

For one thing, the amount of CO2 that can be stored safely underground is limited. That the president of the commission repeats such nonsense reveals why attempts like Cop30 repeatedly fail: so-called climate leaders in fact evince deep ambivalence about phasing out fossil fuels, ultimately unifying global climate politics around the lie that we can keep using fossil fuels and still deal with the climate crisis.

But what of China? Isn’t China becoming the world’s first electrostate, stepping into the role of global climate leader with the US embracing fossil authoritarianism? Well, China seems to be ambivalent too, at least for now. China did not block the text on the roadmap to fossil-fuel phaseout, but neither did it fight to make sure it was included. Despite its dominance in solar, wind and electric vehicles, China acts less as a climate leader and more as an “all of the above” energy powerhouse, devoted first and foremost to its own economic development.

One bright spot of Cop30 is that Colombia and the Netherlands, backed by 22 nations, will independently advance a roadmap to fossil fuel phaseout, beginning with a conference in April 2026. This conference could be a gamechanger. UN rules require all Cop decision texts to be approved unanimously, giving the petrostates veto power over global climate politics. The creation of a fossil-fuel roadmap outside the Cop process may establish a trading bloc that could begin to sanction nations – and banks – that refuse to wind down fossil fuels.

Such a bloc will have no power if its leaders are not forced to resolve their ambivalence about phasing out fossil fuels. And that’s where you and I come in. All of us must do our part and subject world leaders to extreme and relentless public pressure. The challenge of stranding potentially trillions of dollars in fossil capital and rebuilding the world is enormous. Of course, global leaders and officials will take the easier, cowardly road if they can get away with it. As we cross the 1.5C threshold into uncharted climatic territory, we must make them fight wholeheartedly for fossil fuel phaseout. In the end, it is up to us to create a global politics that will finally save the world for our children.",2025-11-24 00:00:00,literal,Factual reporting on reporting and data,literal,literal,0,literal,0.9679391,0.03206098,0.9679391,True
The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/25/giridharan-sivaraman-australia-doesnt-need-another-migration-debate-tackle-inequality#comments,Australia doesn’t need another migration ‘debate’. We need leaders brave enough to tackle inequality for all | Giridharan Sivaraman,"Racism and economic insecurity can have a close relationship in this country. That is most apparent when Australia finds itself pulled into another so-called “debate” about migration. This is usually sparked by populism or attempts to blame complex issues like housing affordability on our annual migrant intake.

Across the country, recent rallies and commentary are blaming migrants for a range of woes, from the cost of living to housing supply. Politicians from various sides made similar claims prior to the last federal election. We’re seeing a rise in far-right parties platformed on anti-immigration rhetoric and racism. This rhetoric feeds on genuine economic concerns but ignores the structural forces driving economic insecurity and undermines the right to dignity, security and equality for all.

The Coalition is reported to be working on a new policy to cut migration. There is nothing wrong with discussing migration levels. The issue is when we are not having honest discussions about the rights to housing, decent social security benefits and fair wages. The debate needs to be courageous enough to require the wealthy and corporations to give fairly to help realise those rights and to interrogate a crisis of systemic inequality.

Taking the easy but misleading route of blaming migrants for economic insecurity only serves to stoke the already smouldering fires of racism. Migrants are dehumanised in this debate, and this racism has harmful impacts on their daily lives.

When commentary repeatedly frames migrants as a burden, a threat or the reason for economic hardship, it reinforces stereotypes that have real consequences. It ignores the fact that migration has been a bedrock of our economic success and that migrants on average contribute far more than they receive. Such narratives have historically paved the way for cuts to social security for all, harsher migration policies and a political climate where compassion is treated as weakness. They shape public fear, not public understanding. And when fear grows, racism grows with it. We must ask ourselves: who benefits when communities are set against each other?

3:33 Factchecking protesters' claims of 'mass migration' into Australia – video

For example, when racism is embedded in migration systems through visa uncertainty or inadequate workplace protection, it enables exploitation. Some employers take advantage of the fact that migrant workers may fear deportation or visa cancellation if they speak up. This means they can be paid less, work longer hours, or accept unsafe conditions as a means of survival. But this is not a “migrant problem”. It is a structural problem that affects the entire labour market. Underpayment in one part of the workforce drags wages down across the economy. It creates a false sense of job scarcity. It pits workers against each other while employers benefit. Migrant workers lose. Local workers lose. The only winners are those who profit from division and vulnerability.

If we truly care about lifting living standards, improving wages and building a fairer future for everyone, then we must tackle the root causes of economic insecurity rather than scapegoat those who contribute enormously to our society. One of the ways of doing this is for the federal government to endorse the national anti-racism framework which marks its one year anniversary this week. Strengthening wage protections, ensuring migrant workers can safely report exploitation and enforcing fair work laws – including a ‘positive duty’ where the onus is on employers to protect workers from racial discrimination – all benefit the entire workforce. When workers feel secure, when wages rise, when housing is affordable, when communities are thriving, racism loses its grip, and everyone wins.

We need to focus on the systems that create poverty, instead of stigmatising people for being disadvantaged by them. If we tackle the real and complex problems that cause economic insecurity, we can reduce racism, while making systems fairer for everyone. Migration has always been part of Australia’s story. What matters now is whether we use it as a political tool that drives us apart and obscures the real problems, or whether we choose leadership that brings people together and improves the lives of all.",2025-11-25 00:00:00,irony,"Skeptical quotes around "" claims of """,irony,figurative,1,figurative,0.45646742,0.5435326,0.5435326,True

Mayfield was replaced by backup Teddy Bridgewater to begin the third quarter. When Mayfield did return to the sideline, he wore street clothes and a protective sling.

Mayfield had his left shoulder checked in the second quarter after he took a hard hit on a scramble, and he grimaced later in the drive after he threw a touchdown pass to Tez Johnson. He walked to a medical tent not moving his left arm.

After his left shoulder was checked between drives, Mayfield wound up to throw as far as he could on the final play before halftime, but after he threw an interception, he immediately reached for the same shoulder and was helped off the field.

Mayfield had endured a brutal first half as Tampa fell behind 31-7, completing nine of his 19 passes for 41 yards, a touchdown and two interceptions. He also was sacked twice.

A 5-1 start to the season, including four comebacks, put Mayfield into the conversation for the NFL's most valuable player in October, as he produced 12 touchdown passes against just one interception. But the Buccaneers then lost three of their next four games to fall to 6-4 entering Sunday's matchup with the Rams.",2025-11-24 04:38:55.011000+00:00,literal,Straightforward news reporting,literal,literal,0,literal,0.98653436,0.013465628,0.98653436,True
NPR,https://www.wrti.org/arts-desk/2025-11-21/meet-the-2026-nea-jazz-masters-lundy-moreira-rushen-hamilton,"Meet the 2026 NEA Jazz Masters: Lundy, Moreira, Rushen, Hamilton","The National Endowment for the Arts announced its 2026 class of NEA Jazz Masters today, continuing the legacy of what has been described as this country’s highest honor for living jazz musicians and advocates. The new honorees are singer and songwriter Carmen Lundy; keyboardist, singer and producer Patrice Rushen; percussionist and composer Airto Moreira; and broadcaster Rhonda Hamilton.

They represent a jazz generation that mostly came of age in the 1970s and ‘80s: with one exception, all of these incoming NEA Jazz Masters are now 71, and still active on the scene. Moreira is the outlier at 84, with a dazzling career that began in his native Brazil during the 1960s, and went on to include extensive work with Miles Davis and two pioneering jazz-rock bands, Weather Report and Return to Forever. He has released dozens of his own albums, often with his wife, the radiant singer Flora Purim.

Among the myriad musicians Airto has crossed paths with is Rushen: they played together on the 2015 album A Jazz Moment in Time. Rushen is the perfect embodiment of a jazz multi-hyphenate, having hit the scene in the early ‘70s as a post-bop piano prodigy, before shifting into a successful R&B career. (In pop culture, she’s best known for her 1982 hit “Forget Me Nots,” and its repurposing for the movie Men in Black.) Rushen has served for many years in the Popular Music program at USC, and she’s now receiving her due as a jazz headliner: she finally headlined this year at Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, and also at the San Francisco Jazz Festival.

There’s collaborative history between Rushen and Lundy, another member of this year’s class: they have recorded together on a number of occasions, including on Lundy’s 2017 album Code Noir. A vocalist of power and presence, Lundy has been a solo artist for more than 40 years, notably writing many of her own songs. Some of these have taken on sociopolitical themes, including mass gun violence and institutionalized racism. The title of Code Noir, in fact, refers to a decree by King Louis XIV in 1685, determining the conditions of slavery in the French colonies, which then included Louisiana. But the album also has its share of ruminative or yearning love songs.

Last but not least is Hamilton, recipient of the 2026 A.B. Spellman NEA Jazz Masters Award for Jazz Advocacy. A steadfast presence on the airwaves since 1979, when she was part of the team that helped establish Newark Public Radio, Hamilton is also known as a founding voice of jazz programming on Sirius Satellite Radio. Now based on the west coast, she can be heard on the air at KJAZZ, a jazz and blues station affiliated with Cal State Long Beach. Her past honors include the Willis Conover-Marian McPartland Excellence in Broadcasting Award from the Jazz Journalists Association.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/nov/20/stevie-nicks-review-brooklyn-tour-date,Stevie Nicks review – rock legend dazzles Brooklyn with anecdotes and classic hits,"Stevie Nicks would like to get the matter of her possible near-death experience out of the way as soon as possible. A few months ago, the Fleetwood Mac singer and rock legend suffered an accident that forced her to postpone a string of tour dates, including this show in Brooklyn which was rescheduled from August to November. “I was airborne,” she recalls of the incident around five minutes after hitting the stage tonight. “I thought: ‘Is it over?’” A voice at the back of the arena lets out an animalistic yell. “No!!!!”

It’s a safe bet that everyone in the 17,000-capacity Barclays Center arena shares the sentiment. Tonight, a noticeably varied audience of fans has shown out for Nicks’s rescheduled date, ranging from witchcore-styled teens to longtime fans who retain a love for the 70s’ bohemian style as well as the decade’s social consciousness: the venue is sold out of veggie burgers.

While Nicks hasn’t released a studio album of new material since 2011’s In Your Dreams, she hasn’t strayed too far from the center of pop culture since. In recent years, she’s regularly performed with Harry Styles, helped inspire a song on Taylor Swift’s zillion-selling The Tortured Poets Department, and had two Barbie dolls created in her honour. In 2019, she became the first woman to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice, in an overdue corrective to initially sluggish critical recognition of her solo work. (She holds the record for the most Grammy nominations for female rock vocal performance without a win.)

After limbering up with some ballet moves and roaring that it’s time to get the party started, Nicks launches into a setlist spanning Fleetwood Mac classics and choice cuts from her stellar 80s albums Bella Donna and The Wild Heart. On If Anyone Falls, she’s fired up as her muscular voice rises to a shout, while the storming centerpiece Stand Back comes alive with a throbbing motorik intro, synthy power-chords, and analog bits of kit that light up like a spaceship’s control room.

The show is part musical performance, part An Evening With Stevie Nicks, with extended and sometimes self-deprecating anecdotes forming the evening’s tapestry. Before launching into a performance of the less-memorable recent single The Lighthouse, Nicks describes being invited to perform the song on Saturday Night Live. “Which I hadn’t been on since, I dunno” – she pretends to think about the year – “nineteen … hundred.” At other times, she’ll tell stories about her capes, regularly disappearing offstage to switch out one embroidered garment for another and rightly pausing to invite a little commotion for the look.

There’s a similar looseness to Nicks’s commitment to building her songs into three-dimensional theatre. In a new version of her Rumours clapback to groupies, Gold Dust Woman becomes a brilliant 13-minute cacophony during which Nicks seems to play both the song’s narrator and the flirty hanger-on: during an extended guitar solo, she dances trance-like as if crafting a love potion, before bellowing a command for the witchy intruder to get out. With her lowered register, it would be pushing it to say that Nicks had never sounded better, but she’s majestically assured on Dreams, with her deepened register adding to the song’s ache.

Missing tonight are Nicks’s former live staples like Leather and Lace, Enchanted, and Sara, as well as well-streamed minor singles like Talk To Me and Rooms On Fire. It’s hard to exactly begrudge Nicks for focusing on the material she knows works as she makes her return to the stage, but a few deeper cuts would have been welcomed by diehards as well as freshened the setlist, which is essentially a curtailed version of her 24 Karat Gold Tour.

Her sense of passion and play still burns bright. “Dance all night long,” Nicks tells the audience as parting words, after a stripped-down Landslide has brought the arena to a hush. “That’s probably what has gotten me to 77 years old. Dance on your way to the kitchen; dance on your way to watching TV; most of all, dance for me.” Her words are warm, whimsical and utterly sincere.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/nov/24/donald-glover-stroke-childish-gambino-tour-2024,Donald Glover reveals he had a stroke on Childish Gambino tour in 2024,"Donald Glover, who performs under the name Childish Gambino, has revealed he had a stroke last year which forced him to cancel world tour dates.

At the time the 42-year-old said he was dealing with an “ailment” after performing in New Orleans and had gone to a hospital in Houston, where he discovered he needed surgery. He subsequently postponed, then entirely cancelled the remainder of his US tour, as well as all of his UK, European and Australian dates, writing: “Unfortunately, my path to recovery is taking longer than expected.”

While performing at Tyler, the Creator’s Camp Flog Gnaw festival in Los Angeles on Saturday night, Glover told the audience that he’d had a stroke.

“I was doing this world tour,” he said. “I was having lots of fun, really loving seeing you guys out there.

“I had a really bad pain in my head in Louisiana and I did the show anyway. I couldn’t really see well, so when we went to Houston, I went to the hospital and the doctor was like, ‘You had a stroke.’

“And the first thing I thought was like, ‘Oh, here I am still copying Jamie Foxx,’” he joked, referring to Foxx’s stroke in 2023. “That’s really like the second thing. The first thing was like, ‘I’m letting everybody down.’ I know it’s not true.”

Glover also revealed that he had broken one of his feet, then doctors found a hole in his heart, which required him to undergo surgery twice.

“They say everybody has two lives and the second life starts when you realise you have one,” Glover said. “You got one life, guys, and I gotta be honest, the life I’ve lived with you guys has been such a blessing.”

Glover, who has won five Grammy awards, has retired his Childish Gambino stage name after releasing his final album, Bando Stone & the New World.

Al Jazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/24/gunfire-explosions-at-paramilitary-hq-in-pakistans-peshawar-reports,Six killed in suicide attack on security complex in Pakistan’s Peshawar,"Three fighters and three security personnel killed in attack on the Federal Constabulary headquarters in Peshawar, media reports say.

Three suicide attackers have attacked the headquarters of a paramilitary force in the Pakistani city of Peshawar, killing at least three security personnel and wounding several others.

The Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, which is a splinter group of the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), or the Pakistan Taliban, claimed responsibility for Monday’s attack on the headquarters of the Federal Constabulary (FC).

The TTP is separate from the Taliban that governs Afghanistan, but they are allies.

“Initially, three militants tried to attack the headquarters,” Peshawar Capital City Police Officer Mian Saeed Ahmad told the Dawn newspaper.

“One bomber blew himself up on the gate while two others tried to enter the premises but were gunned down by FC personnel,” he added.

Asim Khan, a spokesperson at the government-run Lady Reading Hospital, was quoted by The Associated Press news agency as saying all 11 people wounded in the attack were listed in stable condition.

Al Jazeera’s Kamal Hyder, reporting from Peshawar, said the attackers were trying to target more than 400 security personnel who were conducting a parade at the headquarters.

“Senior officials were expected at that particular headquarters, so the attackers were trying to maximise the number of casualties,” Hyder said.

“However, they were intercepted, … and all three were killed, and in the process, three security forces personnel also died,” he said.

Hyder added that the public has been apprehensive due to a recent spike in attacks in Pakistan as the security forces have ramped up their operations against TTP members, killing dozens of them in the past several days.

The targeted headquarters is located in a densely populated area of Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

Pakistani leaders slam attack

President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in separate statements, condemned the attack.

Zardari called it a “cowardly act by foreign-backed terrorists”.

In a post on X, he offered “heartfelt condolences” and praised the courage of the security forces.

Sharif said the swift response of security forces prevented a larger tragedy, adding: “We will thwart the evil designs of terrorists who attack Pakistan’s integrity.”

The latest attack came less than two weeks after a suicide bomber struck outside a court in Pakistan’s capital, Islamabad, detonating explosives next to a police car and killing 12 people.

Al Jazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/11/19/trumps-russian-oil-waiver-gives-orban-a-win-at-hungarys-expense,Trump’s Russian oil waiver gives Orban a win at Hungary’s expense,"Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban and his very large team of ministers, propagandists and members of the country’s well-connected economic elite flew to Washington on November 7 to meet President Donald Trump, the first bilateral meeting of the two leaders since his return to power. The trip itself was unprecedented in its scale and unusual because of its historical context. A veritable spectacle.

Trump has been pressuring Orban to align with his sanctions on Russian fossil fuels and purchase more American LNG. Trump’s hardening stance towards Russia was a blow to Orban, who has positioned himself as Trump’s closest ally in Europe, ostracised by Western liberals yet on good terms with Moscow and Washington. Initially, his gambit seemed to pay off, as Trump sought a quick end to the war in Ukraine by offering concessions to Russia.

Over time, the classic foreign policy bureaucracy seems to have regained influence and pushed back against Trump’s inner circle around Putin. The latest sanctions and intensified military cooperation signal this shift. Foreign policy discussions in Budapest over the past few weeks have centred on the question of whether, and for how long, Orban can avoid these sanctions and continue buying Russian oil. Thus, the stakes of the meeting were high.

A pyrrhic victory for Orban

The details of the announced deal are still somewhat murky. Orban presented the outcome as a blanket exemption, but Secretary of State Marco Rubio contradicted this, stating that the waiver lasts only one year, while United States officials have flagged to reporters that it has not yet been formalised and remains a verbal understanding. Either way, the imminent threat of financial havoc has apparently been postponed until after the elections in April. Trump also amplified Orban’s misleading messaging about the difficulties of eliminating the country’s dependence on Russian oil. Furthermore, the politicians put the proposed Trump-Putin meeting in Budapest back on the agenda.

Even with all the uncertainties, the deal represents a victory for Orban. He could leverage his American ties and symbolic capital, has another chance to portray himself as a politician punching far above his weight in international politics, and kept Russian oil and the flagship Hungarian energy company’s profits flowing.

However, this is a pyrrhic victory. Costly beyond Orban’s gifts and promises to Trump and his economic commitments made in Washington. And these commitments are not negligible. They range from buying American nuclear fuel – which itself represents a U-turn in Hungarian energy policy that will require a thick skin to sell to a Hungarian audience that has been fed a narrative of no alternative to Russian involvement in Hungarian nuclear energy – to buying US military equipment and liquefied gas.

Orban continues to trade concessions such as procurement and policy alignment for external lifelines rather than building endogenous capacity. However, the real costs are deeper and can be found in three dimensions: moral political costs, economic dependence, and a costly illiberal ecosystem.

The moral and political costs

First, the American green light to Hungary’s continued dependence on Russian fossils has serious moral and political costs. Orban has no qualms about cosying up to war criminals. Still, his ties with Putin carry moral costs at a scale that has profound political implications.

Today, Slovakia and Hungary are the only European Union countries still receiving oil from Russia, with the Hungarian oil giant MOL Group playing a significant role in Slovakia’s energy sector. After Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, Hungary increased its share of Russian oil imports by 25 percentage points to 86 percent in 2024. Importing Russian oil is profitable for Hungary, allowing for relatively low energy prices, a key pillar in Orban’s illiberal playbook.

It took significant campaigning to convince part of his electorate that Putin is a good guy who makes reduced energy prices possible and protects white Christian conservatism against the “self-sabotaging” “Islamo-communist” West. Most Hungarians are still pro-EU, and appearing as Russia’s Trojan horse is electorally costly. Furthermore, Orban’s Putinism isolated him even among illiberal allies from Warsaw to Rome. Budapest signalled on November 14 that it will challenge the EU’s planned 2027 phase-out of Russian energy, further deepening the political consequences of Orban’s alignment with Moscow.

The exhaustion of Orbanomics

Second, the price Hungary pays for Russian oil is not only measured in roubles flowing East but in euros lost from the West. Despite all the economic nationalist chest-beating, Hungary remains heavily dependent on foreign capital and EU funds. Throughout the 2010s, Orban could get away with his shenanigans in Europe, aided and abetted by mainstream conservatives. Escalating corruption in Hungary and finally Budapest’s doubling down on pro-Russian foreign policy manoeuvres even after the invasion of Ukraine hardened European elites against Orban. Orbanomics emerged as an illiberal response to the internal contradictions of liberal globalism.

Yet, it failed to create a sustainable economic alternative, failed at industrial upgrading and improving domestic capacities, while deliberately repressing wage growth to maintain the country’s cost competitiveness in its low-value assembly platform economy. The “Eastern Opening” gamble also failed to replace Western markets and capital. The political-economic exhaustion of Orbanomics has intensified the Hungarian economy’s external vulnerabilities. One of those vulnerabilities is the loss of EU funds.

A one-year US waiver on Russian oil and gas eases the immediate energy squeeze and props up Orban’s energy politics, but it doubles down on the country’s core weakness: an externally wired, shock-prone model with thin domestic upgrading, wage repression and dependence on foreign monetary goodwill. Hence, continuing to maintain close ties with Putin undermines the country’s economic future.

The architecture of illiberal power

Third, the ties and symbolic capital Orban could leverage in Washington did not appear out of thin air. He was among the first to grasp that for the illiberal right, seizing the state was not enough. Real power requires dismantling liberal hegemony. From 2010 onwards, he launched a counter-hegemonic project aimed at remaking the state, civil society and culture in the service of an alternative order. This project soon reached beyond Hungary’s borders: a small state cannot sustain such ambitions alone.

Orban, therefore, sought to embed Hungary’s transformation within an international illiberal ecosystem, forging ties above all with US national conservatives. Over the past decade, Hungary has poured substantial resources into cultivating these links. Trump and his intellectual circle, in turn, treat Hungary as an illiberal laboratory to justify assaults on higher education, media, civil society and democratic institutions. Orbanism and Trumpism are twin expressions of a deliberate, tectonic revolt against the liberal world order, hence the depth of their ideological bond. Hungary is a “unique island in an ocean of liberalism,” as Orban said after he met with Trump.

Yet their mutual admiration conceals a costly reality: a taxpayer-funded network of foundations, consultancies and media platforms circulating people, ideas and strategies across the illiberal ecosystem. The pyrrhic victory in Washington in November 2025 was the product of this illiberal counter-hegemonic machinery, whose costs are measurable in hundreds of millions of dollars. Yet the same network that delivers symbolic wins and temporary policy concessions also binds Budapest to Trump’s transactional asks.

Rescuing illiberalism?

Thus, the costs of the Trump-Orban deal are significant and manifold. Orban’s request was granted, but it does not fix Hungary’s political-economic vulnerabilities. Nevertheless, Orban achieved a significant short-term victory that could even influence the outcome of the upcoming election next April. With the country’s economy in shambles, averting the financial costs of the sanctions gives Orban’s government a lifeline. It makes some room for pre-election measures to improve Orban’s favourability ratings. These steps allow for the minimising of the costs of the exhaustion of Orbanomics.

Staying in power will require reframing the election so that Orban can reap the domestic benefits of his illiberal international ties. This wouldn’t be a small feat in a politically and linguistically tightly closed country. Nevertheless, in contrast to saving the sinking economy, this foreign policy reframing is feasible before the election. If Trump were to gift Orban a visit in Budapest and maybe even a “peace summit” with Putin, then that could save his loyal Hungarian friend’s political future.

“I had a really bad pain in my head in Louisiana and I did the show anyway,” Glover, 42, told a concert crowd during a Nov. 22 performance at the musical festival Camp Flog Gnaw, per videos shared on social media.

After the tour moved to Houston, he said he went to a hospital.

“The doctor was like, ‘You had a stroke,’” he said.

“The first thing I thought was like, ‘Oh, here I am still copying Jamie Foxx,’” he joked, referring to the stroke the “Ray” star suffered in April 2023 that left him hospitalized for weeks.

“That’s really like the second thing. The first thing was like, ‘I’m letting everybody down,’” Glover continued.

He said doctors went on to find “a hole in my heart,” leading to him having two surgeries.

He then reflected on what his health scare has taught him while speaking with the crowd.

“They say everybody has two lives and the second life starts when you realize you have one. You’ve got one life, guys and I gotta be honest. The life I’ve lived with you guys has been such a blessing. I love seeing and performing for you guys,” he said. “As my wife says, which I love, she says, if this life is a flavor, soon as I’m done give me another scoop.”

“You should be living your life how you want because it can only get better,” Glover concluded. “If we have to do this again, it can only get better.”

Glover’s health update comes a little more than a year after he announced on Oct. 4, 2024, that he was canceling the remainder of Childish Gambino’s “New World Tour” because of health issues.

NBC News Think,https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/trump-mobile-phone-customers-left-waiting-months-delay-rcna245035,The Trump Mobile phone is nowhere to be found after months of delay,"In June, President Donald Trump’s two older sons held an event at Trump Tower where they touted a new made-in-the-USA mobile phone with an American flag on its back, plus a new wireless service called Trump Mobile.

The phone was announced on the 10th anniversary of Trump’s presidential campaign launch and was the Trump brand’s first foray into mobile products and services. According to the initial announcement, the phone was supposed to be released in August.

But three months later, there are no signs that the phone has become a reality.

NBC News placed an order for a T1 phone in August, paying the $100 deposit for the purposes of tracking the $499 phone’s development.

After confirming with the credit card company that the transaction was not fraudulent, NBC News received a confirmation email verifying the order.

But the company provided no proactive updates after the order. NBC News made five separate phone calls to the Trump Mobile customer support line between September and November. At one point in October, the call operator promised a specific ship date: Nov. 13.

That date passed without an update, and when NBC News followed up with the call center, an operator said the delivery would now be in the “beginning of December,” with no specific date.

The operator cited the government shutdown as a reason for the delay, without further explanation.

Trump Mobile launched the T1 phone in tandem with a number of phone service offerings, including a 5G service plan priced at $47.45 per month — a nod to the president’s terms. In addition to unlimited talk, text and data, the plan promised “telehealth services, including virtual medical care.”

But since the original announcement, plans appear to be in flux. Quiet edits to the Trump Mobile website suggest that details around the phone’s design and production may have changed since it was announced.

The Trump Mobile website has scrubbed any mention of a specific release month, but continues to collect $100 down payments on the promise of availability “later this year.”

Neither Trump Mobile nor the Trump Organization responded to NBC News’ multiple requests for comment on when the phone would be released and why it’s delayed.

When the company announced the phone in June, photos on the website promised a phone featuring an iPhone-like cluster of three cameras on its back.

But in August, Trump Mobile’s X account posted, “The wait is almost over!” The post featured a photo of a supposed T1 phone with a completely different design, including more than three rear cameras.

The Verge reported that the phone appeared to be a render of a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra. When phone case company Spigen noticed that the photo appeared to be a doctored image of a Samsung in one of its cases, the company suggested it would sue.

NBC News has not been able to identify any lawsuit from Spigen, and the company has not responded to repeated requests for comment.

In late June, the same month the phone was announced, the website removed any mention of “Made in the USA,” as was originally promised.

Instead, the website now says the phone is “brought to life right here in the USA. With American hands behind every device,” and that the phone has “American-proud design.”

The T1 phone has been met with skepticism since its unveiling.

Smartphone industry insiders have suggested it’s nearly impossible to manufacture a “Made in the USA” smartphone on as quick a timeline as Trump Mobile has promised, and without some Chinese involvement.

Todd Weaver, the founder and CEO of Purism, a Carlsbad, California-based company that manufactures the only U.S.-made smartphone on the market, said that when his company started, there was “no skilled labor” in the U.S. capable of manufacturing a phone, and “nobody [had] done it before.”He said that creating a chain of production that would allow for a made-in-the-USA label was time and labor-intensive.

“We actually had to go over to China with our designs, to learn the process, the manufacturing process, to see what are all the steps,” Weaver said.

He said it took him six years to take his Liberty Phone from idea to production, which Purism sells at a $2,000 price point.

And even then, Liberty Phone isn’t entirely American-sourced, even if it is branded as “Made in the USA electronics.”

Most of its materials come from the United States, Canada or Europe. Other parts like the chassis are made in different countries, including China and India, according to the company.

While Trump Mobile customers wait for the T1, the company is offering other phones for sale, including refurbished iPhones (which are primarily produced in China) and devices from Samsung, a Korean company. Trump Mobile says that both devices are “brought to life right here in the USA.”",2025-11-24 10:00:40+00:00,literal,Factual reporting on reporting and data,literal,literal,0,literal,0.86744577,0.1325543,0.86744577,True
NBC News Think,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/families-sue-infant-formula-maker-byheart-botulism-outbreak-rcna244989,More families sue ByHeart as company confirms botulism spores were found in its infant formula,"At least four families have sued infant formula maker ByHeart saying their babies contracted botulism from contaminated formula, as the company faces ongoing scrutiny from federal investigators and a separate class action lawsuit filed last week.

In the lawsuits, affected families described harrowing days or weeks in the hospital with their babies, who were placed on IVs and feeding tubes. Many said they had chosen ByHeart’s formula because it contained organic whole milk and minimal additives, making it seem like the healthiest option.

The company said in a statement Wednesday that laboratory tests had identified Clostridium botulinum spores in samples of its formula. ByHeart told NBC News that it could not comment on pending litigation and that “the company is focused on the recall and root cause investigation at this time.”

According to the Food and Drug Administration, 31 infants who consumed the formula have suspected or confirmed botulism. The cases span 15 states, and all have required hospitalization. No deaths have been reported.

The bacteria that causes botulism can grow in foods that aren’t properly canned or preserved, and it produces a toxin that attacks the nerves. The resulting illness can cause difficulty breathing, muscle paralysis or death.

ByHeart said on its website that it has not identified the root cause of the contamination but has shared its test results with the FDA.

“We immediately notified the FDA of those findings, and we are working to investigate the facts, conduct ongoing testing to identify the source, and ensure this does not happen to families again,” it said.

In an interview with NBC News, Hanna Everett said she started giving ByHeart formula to her daughter, Piper, at around 2 months old. By early this month, Piper was constipated and drooling excessively, and her left eye seemed droopy, Everett said. A friend sent her a link to the ByHeart recall.

“Sure enough, the can she had just finished that day was the exact lot number that was affected,” said Everett, who lives in Richmond, Kentucky.

Piper was admitted to a children’s hospital on Nov. 9, where she was diagnosed with botulism. Everett said the sight of doctors and nurses struggling to administer IVs and a feeding tube made her throw up.

Two friends had to physically prop her up, she said, “because I was just bawling.”

“They’re holding your child down that’s not even 4 months old technically at the time, and she’s just screaming bloody murder. And there’s nothing you can do,” Everett said.

Piper was given a botulism antitoxin via an IV drip. The treatment isn’t readily stocked at hospitals, so it had to be flown in. Everett said Piper’s condition has improved; she was released from the hospital roughly a week ago.

But Everett is still wracked with guilt.

“It feels like I let her down when I know that’s not the case. It’s hard to tell yourself that as a mother, because you’re going to blame yourself,” she said.

Everett and her husband, Michael, sued ByHeart last week, seeking damages for medical expenses, pain and suffering.

“It makes me more angry and just sick to my stomach that it took them as long as it did to own up to this,” she said. “It’s almost like too little, too late.”

Everett said she messaged ByHeart about the recall while Piper was in the hospital, and it offered to send her more formula cans.

Darin Detwiler, a professor of food regulatory policy at Northeastern University, agreed that ByHeart should have taken comprehensive action more quickly.

“They should have identified this on their own, and they should have been forthcoming immediately,” he said.

After the FDA alerted ByHeart to the potential link between its formula and the botulism outbreak, the company initially recalled just two lots. The following day, ByHeart posted on its website that there was not enough evidence to link its product to the illnesses because a sample that had tested positive for botulism bacteria came from an opened can, which “can be contaminated in multiple ways.”

In court filings, parents suing ByHeart have described states of terror.

In the latest suit, filed on Wednesday, a Washington state couple said their daughter had chronic constipation, difficulty feeding and extreme fatigue while taking the formula. She was admitted to the emergency room at 2 months old, the filing says.

The family left the hospital on Wednesday, according to the suit. The mother, Madison Wescott, said she doesn’t produce enough milk to satisfy her daughter’s needs without formula.

“Knowing that I can’t fully feed my child, and I can’t trust formula companies has really taken a toll on our family,” Wescott said in the suit.

In California, Anthony Barbera and Thalia Flores exclusively fed their son ByHeart formula after he was born, according to their lawsuit. By the time their son received the antitoxin for botulism at the hospital, he was no longer eating, connected to multiple IV lines and too weak to cry, their lawsuit says.

Arizona parents Stephen and Yurany Dexter said in their lawsuit that their daughter stopped eating altogether in August, refusing the bottle of formula as soon as it touched her lips. She was transported by air ambulance to a children’s hospital. The couple said they feared she might die or never recover fully.

Bill Marler, a lawyer representing the Dexters, Wescotts and Barbera and Flores, said ByHeart has “a lot to answer for.”

“If there’s a product that should be safe, it should be infant formula,” he said.

Before this, no botulism outbreaks had ever been linked to infant formula in the U.S. Formula makers aren’t required to regularly test for Clostridium botulinum, but they must follow sanitary control practices to prevent contamination and are subject to FDA inspections.

Most of the major formula recalls in recent years — including the 2022 Abbott Nutrition recall, which contributed to a national formula shortage — were because of potential contamination with a different bacteria, Cronobacter sakazakii. ByHeart also recalled batches of its formula in December 2022 because of possible Cronobacter contamination.

In 2023, the FDA sent a warning letter to ByHeart describing “significant violations” at its manufacturing facility in Pennsylvania. The FDA said that ByHeart attributed a batch of formula that tested positive for Cronobacter to a laboratory error, though the lab denied that that was the case. The agency also said there were two water leaks at the facility, and that ByHeart did not evaluate a potential link between the leaks and formula that later tested positive for Cronobacter.

ByHeart’s website states that it “undertook action to address the issues and there are no open issues from that warning letter.” The Pennsylvania facility was not involved in the production of formula in the current recall, the company said.

Abigail Snyder, an associate professor of microbial food safety at Cornell University, said an FDA warning letter like the one ByHeart got is “pretty unusual,” though there was increased regulatory activity around infant formula after the Abbott recall.

“Fewer ingredients and whole milk is a different attribute than microbial safety, unfortunately,” she said.",2025-11-22 10:00:40+00:00,literal,Factual reporting on reporting and policy,literal,literal,0,literal,0.88416284,0.11583715,0.88416284,True
Al Jazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/11/15/why-russias-liberal-opposition-is-so-anti-palestinian,Why Russia’s liberal opposition is so anti-Palestinian,"In July, Uzbekistan-born, Russian-speaking Israeli writer Dina Rubina gave an interview to the Russian opposition channel Rain TV, which caused a stir in the Russophone world. During the hour-and-a-half programme, she declared that there are no “peaceful residents” in Gaza, Israel has the right to “cleanse Gaza and turn it into a parking lot”, and that Palestinians need to be “dissolved in hydrochloric acid”.

Self-exiled journalist and producer Mikhail Kozyrev, who interviewed Rubina, decided to take out these bits, calling them “the most complex part” of the interview. Although he appeared to question Rubina on the claim that there are no “peaceful residents in Gaza” by comparing it to the collective blame Russians face over the war in Ukraine, he did not reject her claims and himself took a clear pro-Israel stance throughout his conversation with her.

And while many Russian speakers condemned Rubina – especially in Central Asia where her book talks were cancelled – there were many among Russia’s political emigres who supported her, did not condemn her openly, or maintained her words were taken out of context.

This incident is not an aberration. Many in the Russian liberal opposition, which now operates mostly in exile, unquestioningly support Israel. This is not only due to their tendency to disregard institutionalised racism in Russia but also due to their embrace of a civilisational hierarchy narrative that places the white West at the top. Anti-Palestinian bias is a natural outcome of this worldview.

Examples of the Russian opposition’s virulent anti-Palestinianism abound. Yuliya Latynina, a star columnist living in exile, has made parallels between “barbarians” destroying “blossoming civilisations” and the Palestinians and called students protesting against the genocide in Gaza “lazy and stupid”.

Another self-exiled liberal commentator, Leonid Gozman, has claimed that European countries that voted at the United Nations in favour of a “pro-Hamas” resolution calling for a truce in Gaza did so because they were “afraid of their immigrant communities”.

Andrei Pivovarov, former director of Open Russia, a now-defunct pro-democracy organisation, has said he finds Israel’s actions in Gaza “justified”. He was imprisoned in Russia until he was released last year in a prisoner exchange with the West.

Russian opposition politician, Dmitri Gudkov, currently residing in Bulgaria, has declared: “For me, Israel is the embodiment of civilisation. Anything against it is barbarism.”

Kseniya Larina, a renowned Russian journalist and radio host, also currently in exile, has hosted on her show Israeli Russian-speaking intellectuals multiple times. In one instance, a talk with an Israeli educator was titled, “Recognition of Palestine is not antisemitism, it’s idiocy”.

These are just a few examples of the many Russian liberal emigres who openly supported Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza. In addition, Russian pop icons, comedians, musicians, and TV personalities who are based in Israel or visit also constantly broadcast the Israeli narrative.

Popular Russian oppositional media outlets – the Nobel Prize recipient newsletter Novaya Gazeta, Meduza publication outlet, and TV Rain – disproportionately feature pro-Israeli news with little counter-narrative offered. As a result, racist, anti-Palestinian rhetoric thrives in Russian-language social and traditional media.

The roots of this pro-Israeli stance among Russia’s liberals – who make up the majority of the Russian opposition – go back to the 20th century.

The Jewish people were persecuted by the Tsarist regime during the Russian Empire, which the Bolsheviks initially denounced. But the communist regime itself eventually embraced anti-Semitic views under Joseph Stalin. Discrimination against Jews continued, and it peaked during 1951-53, when Stalin accused a group of Jewish doctors of conspiracy against the state and launched a campaign of persecution. Even after the Communist Party dropped the accusations, Jews continued to be subject to forced assimilation and structural discrimination.

Within this context, the emerging liberal opposition of the 1980s came to perceive Israel as a protector of the victimised Jewish community and a democratic, liberal state, part of the West.

In parallel, there was an immigration wave towards Israel, which was seen as a place of safety for Soviet opposition figures. This also fed into an unconditional allegiance to Israel and Zionism among dissidents, which was inherited by subsequent generations of the liberal opposition.

The pro-Israel bias of the Russian opposition intensified even more after the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, which sent hundreds of thousands of opposition-minded Russians fleeing abroad. Israel has been one of the main destinations; by some estimates, in 2022 alone, some 70,000 Russians moved there, compared with 27,000 in 2021, contributing to a total of about 1.3 million Russian-speakers in Israel.

The paradox here is that the Russian liberal opposition maintains that it is the democratic, moral alternative to President Vladimir Putin’s authoritarianism while openly expressing racist views against the Palestinians. It largely condemns Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and Russian war crimes, but denies the Israeli ones.

In the West, the self-declared democratic values of the Russian opposition are rarely scrutinised. But they should be, because it is not just in relation to Palestine that its racist views are apparent.

In the past, liberal opposition figures have frequently reproduced Kremlin-style narratives about migrants, Muslims, and other racialised people. For example, the late opposition leader Alexey Navalny, once hailed as Russia’s democratic hope, referred to migrants from the Caucasus as “cockroaches” and “flies” in a 2007 video on “How to fight insects”. In 2021, these and other statements led Amnesty International to revoke his prisoner of conscience status; the organisation later apologised and continued to advocate for him until his death in custody.

In April this year, Vladimir Kara-Murza, the vice president of the Free Russia Foundation, claimed that soldiers from Russia’s minorities have an easier time killing Ukrainians than ethnic Russian soldiers do. The statement was seen as an attempt to blame war crimes on racialised minorities and prompted an open letter from the Indigenous of Russia Foundation denouncing it.

These attitudes expressed by Navalny and Kara-Murza are not exceptional. The Russian liberal opposition rarely, if ever, condemns discrimination or racist violence against minorities in Russia. Last year, when activist Rifat Dautov died in custody from apparent torture in the Bashkortostan region, there was almost no reaction from the exiled opposition communities. By contrast, when several weeks later, Navalny died of suspected poisoning in prison, the eulogies and mourning lasted for months.

This reflects a longstanding pattern within Russian liberalism: claiming moral superiority over the Kremlin while sharing the same problematic and prejudiced thinking. The truth is, even if Putin’s regime were to fall tomorrow and this opposition come to power, it is unlikely that it would carry out any major reforms to remove structural racism. The concerns of peripheralised regions that seek greater autonomy within Russia, non-Russian ethnic people, and Indigenous and migrant populations in Russia, do not seem to trouble Russia’s liberal opposition.

It is no wonder the Russian liberal opposition tries to blame Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Putin. It does not want the war to be seen as a direct continuation of Russia’s and the erstwhile USSR’s longstanding expansionist politics and drive to subjugate peoples perceived as lesser.

While in the case of Ukraine, Russian liberals are able to hide behind their opposition to the war, in the case of Palestine, they are exposed.

What Palestinians face today – dehumanisation, dispossession, and denial of existence – mirrors what many racialised and Indigenous people within Russia have long endured. Yet the Russian opposition remains blind to these experiences and continues to see itself as the sole victim of Russian authoritarianism.

Al Jazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/11/23/venezuela-a-not-so-covert-cia-disaster-in-the-making,Venezuela: A not-so-covert CIA disaster in the making,"Venezuela doesn’t even produce fentanyl, but Washington is still going forward with regime change efforts in Caracas as part of its ‘war on drugs’.

On Saturday, the Reuters news agency published an exclusive report claiming that the United States is “poised to launch a new phase of Venezuela-related operations in the coming days”. The report cited four US officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. Two of the officials said covert operations would likely be the first step in this “new action” against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.

This was less than shocking news given that more than a month ago, US President Donald Trump himself announced that he had authorised the CIA to conduct covert operations in Venezuela – a rather unique approach since one does not normally broadcast actions that are supposed to be, um, secret.

Anyway, it’s no secret that the US has been overseeing a massive military build-up in the region with about 15,000 US troops currently stationed there under the guise of fighting “narcoterrorism”. Since early September, Trump has also presided over wanton extrajudicial executions in the Caribbean Sea, repeatedly ordering the bombing of what he claims are drug-trafficking boats.

In addition to violating both international and US law, the strikes have produced little to show for themselves beyond terrorising local fishermen.

To be sure, the US has never met a “war on drugs” it didn’t love, given the convenient opportunities the whole drug-war narrative offers for wreaking havoc worldwide, militarising the Western Hemisphere, criminalising poor Americans and all sorts of other good stuff.

Never mind that US financial institutions have for decades reaped profits from the international drug trade – or that “The CIA Drug Connection Is as Old as the Agency,” as an article on The New York Times website puts it.

It should come as no surprise by now that the president who campaigned on keeping the US out of wars and then promptly bombed Iran has now found another conflict in which to embroil the country. And as is par for the course in US imperial belligerence, the rationale for aggression against Venezuela doesn’t hold water.

For example, the Trump administration has strived to pin the blame for the fentanyl crisis in the US on Maduro. But there’s a slight problem – which is that Venezuela doesn’t even produce the synthetic opioid in question.

As NBC News and other hardly radical outlets have pointed out, Venezuelan drug cartels are focused on exporting cocaine to Europe, not fentanyl to the US.

Nevertheless, on November 13, US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth – pardon, US Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, as per administrative rebranding – took to X to assure his audience that the massive US military build-up off the Venezuelan coast is a mission that “defends our Homeland, removes narco-terrorists from our Hemisphere, and secures our Homeland from the drugs that are killing our people”.

This is the same administration, of course, that was just threatening to starve impoverished Americans by withholding essential food assistance, which suggests that the wellbeing of “our people” isn’t really of utmost concern.

Consider also the fact that Trump slashed federal funding for gun violence prevention programmes in a country where mass shootings have become a way of life. Obviously, massacres in elementary schools are “killing our people” in a way that has nothing whatsoever to do with Venezuela.

But it’s so much more fun to blame Maduro for everything, right?

Poverty itself is a major killer in America – as is the domestic pharmaceutical industry (speaking of opioids). However, none of these full-blown crises has merited a remotely gung-ho response from the valiant defenders of the Homeland.

Like his predecessor Hugo Chavez, Maduro has long been a thorn in the side of US empire – hence the current campaign to discredit him as a “narcoterrorist” and thereby set the stage for regime change. He also happens to be a pet target of Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is seen as the main architect of Washington’s war plans in Venezuela. Potentially eyeing a presidential bid in three years, Rubio is seeking to curry favour with his Florida constituency, which includes fanatically right-wing members of the Venezuelan and Cuban diasporas.

According to the Reuters report on impending “Venezuela-related operations”, two of the US officials consulted told the news agency that “the options under consideration included attempting to overthrow Maduro”. If the plans succeeds, Rubio would join the lengthy roster of US politicians who have propagated deadly havoc abroad in the interest of political gains at home.

Meanwhile, The Washington Post reported on Saturday that the White House had “proposed an idea for US military planes to drop leaflets over Caracas in a psychological operation” to pressure Maduro.

Sounds like a page – or a leaflet – out of the old Israeli military playbook.

And as the Trump administration barrels on with its not-so-covert plans for Venezuela, such hemispheric recklessness will secure neither the US homeland nor anyone else’s.

After two decades and an estimated cost of $1bn, the Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM) opened its doors to the public on Tuesday, just a few days after the official opening ceremony on Saturday.

Regarded as the world’s largest archaeological facility for a single civilisation, the museum is located 2km (1.2 miles) from the pyramids of Giza and 8km (5 miles) from the capital, Cairo.

The complex spans nearly 500,000sq metres (5,381,900sq ft) and will house more than 100,000 ancient artefacts from the 30 dynasties of ancient Egypt.

Some of the main attractions include the 3,200-year-old, 11.36-metre (37ft) statue of King Ramses II, the complete collection of Tutankhamun’s treasures and a 4,500-year-old boat, one of the oldest intact ships in the world, belonging to Khufu, the pharaoh renowned for building the Great Pyramid of Giza.

The Grand Egyptian Museum’s design

The museum has been called the “fourth pyramid” of the Giza Plateau, which is home to three pyramids about 4,500 years old: the Great Pyramid of Giza (built for Pharaoh Khufu), the Pyramid of Khafre (built for Pharaoh Khafre) and the Pyramid of Menkaure (built for Pharaoh Menkaure).

Visitors can view the pyramids from inside the museum, which is designed in the shape of a chamfered triangle, echoing the geometry of the pyramids. The museum’s north and south walls are aligned with the Pyramid of Khufu and the Pyramid of Menkaure.

The design, created by the Irish architecture firm Heneghan Peng, uses sand-coloured concrete and translucent alabaster stone while the museum’s main facade is made of frosted glass panels.

The complex was announced in 1992, but construction did not begin until 2005 and was delayed by political turmoil after the 2011 Arab Spring and the COVID-19 pandemic. Some areas of the museum had a soft launch in 2024.

The museum complex includes the main building, a conference centre, a courtyard, a Nile Valley park, the Khufu Boat Museum and a conservation centre.

A look inside the museum

Upon entering the museum, visitors are greeted by the 3,200-year-old statue of King Ramses II, which weighs about 83 tonnes.

From 1954 to 2006, the statue stood in Ramses Square in front of Cairo’s main train station before being relocated to its new location near the museum. To facilitate the move, the statue was transported upright and in one piece on a specially designed 128-wheel vehicle, covering a distance of 30km (19 miles) and necessitating temporary road closures.

Beyond the entrance is the six-storey grand staircase, lined with about 60 artefacts, including statues that honour deities, sarcophagi that hold the deceased, columns showcasing ancient architectural artistry,, and stelae inscribed with significant texts.

The museum boasts 12 main permanent exhibition halls, which opened last year and are organised by both era (ranging from prehistory through the Greco-Roman period) and theme (including society, kingship and belief).

The Tutankhamun gallery

Among the museum’s most prominent and largest exhibition spaces is the Tutankhamun Gallery, a 7,500sq-metre (80,000sq-ft) space that features more than 5,000 artefacts unearthed from the tomb of Tutankhamun, the boy king who ascended to the throne at about nine years old and ruled during the Eighteenth Dynasty nearly 3,400 years ago.

Despite his brief reign, which ended with his unexpected death at about 18 or 19 years old, Tutankhamun is one of the most famous pharaohs, largely due to the discovery of his nearly intact tomb in 1922 in the Valley of the Kings on the west side of the Nile opposite the city of Luxor.

Visitors can see his golden mask, throne, sarcophagus, chariots and jewellery, all presented to re-create the atmosphere of his royal burial chamber.

One of the world’s largest museums

The Grand Egyptian Museum has about 45,000sq metres (484,000sq ft) of exhibition space, making it the sixth largest museum in the world by display area.

The Louvre in Paris tops the list with 72,735sq metres, followed by the State Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg, Russia (66,842sq metres), the National Museum of China in Beijing (65,000sq metres), the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City (58,820sq metres) and the Museo del Prado in Madrid, Spain (47,700sq metres).

Tourism is a major source of foreign currency for Egypt. In 2024, a record 15.7 million tourists visited Egypt, and the travel and tourism sector contributed roughly 8 percent of the country’s gross domestic product, according to official figures.",2025-11-04 00:00:00,metaphor,Throne used as metaphor for position of power,metaphor,figurative,1,literal,0.92006963,0.079930395,0.92006963,False

Banjo, harp and drums are not exactly your typical jazz trio. But Béla Fleck, Edmar Castañeda and Antonio Sánchez make that combination come alive in a project they call the BEATrio. Sánchez jokes that it might be ""the world's most unlikely band.""

Their story traces back to 2019, when Fleck and Castañeda shared a duo set at the Big Ears Festival in Knoxville, captured on video by Jazz Night in America. When Sánchez later invited Fleck to record for a studio project, Castañeda joined the session, and the three quickly discovered how naturally their sounds fit together despite coming from very different musical traditions.

Fleck is a banjo virtuoso who has redrawn the instrument's boundaries across genres. Castañeda has transformed the Colombian harp into an instrument capable of both rhythmic drive and harmonic flexibility. Sánchez is a drummer whose narrative approach to rhythm has made him one of the most distinctive voices on the instrument.

""When we play together, we lock. It's like one person,"" Fleck says.

The BEATrio's debut recording, which came out in May, earned a Grammy nomination; a tour begins next year. This episode features music from the trio's self-titled album alongside the Fleck-Castañeda duo performance at Big Ears.

Al Jazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/25/what-military-force-has-the-us-positioned-off-venezuelas-coast,What military force has the US positioned off Venezuela’s coast?,"The US has attacked several Venezuelan boats and deployed its largest military buildup in Latin America in decades.

United States President Donald Trump’s campaign against “narcoterrorists” has transformed the Caribbean into a new battlefield.

Since August, Washington has deployed thousands of troops, warships and aircraft across the region, and reopened military bases in Puerto Rico and conducted drills, in what analysts describe as the largest US presence in Latin America in decades.

In September, the US began a series of strikes on Venezuelan boats it claims were trafficking drugs to the US, with the latest attack on Friday killing six people on board. Last week, Trump announced that he had authorised covert CIA operations in Venezuela and that he was even mulling a land attack.

However, on Thursday, Trump denied that all this amounts to a declaration of war on Venezuela.

“Well, I don’t think we’re going to necessarily ask for a declaration of war,” he said.

“I think we’re just going to kill people that are bringing drugs into our country. OK? We’re going to kill them,” Trump said.

How many Venezuelan boats has the US attacked?

The US military has carried out at least ten deadly strikes on vessels off Venezuela’s coast, and in the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean since September 2, marking the most intense American military activity in Latin America since the US invasion of Panama in 1989.

The operations, conducted under the authority of the US Southern Command (SOUTHCOM), have killed at least 43 people, according to statements by Trump and senior defence officials.

The map below shows the approximate locations of at least six of these attacks, according to data compiled by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data (ACLED). Most of these attacks occurred close to the Venezuelan coast and in international waters – raising questions about the legality of the US’s use of force, especially when no imminent threat was present.

What is SOUTHCOM?

US Southern Command (SOUTHCOM), headquartered in Doral, Florida, is one of 11 unified combatant commands of the US Department of War (renamed by Trump from the Department of Defense). It oversees operations in Central and South America and the Caribbean, including the defence of the Panama Canal.

The other 10 commands cover different regions or functions such as North America (NORTHCOM), Europe (EUCOM), Africa (AFRICOM), the Middle East (CENTCOM), and the Indo-Pacific (INDOPACOM), while others have global responsibilities like cyber operations (CYBERCOM), space (SPACECOM), nuclear deterrence (STRATCOM), strategic logistics (TRANSCOM) and Special Operations forces worldwide (SOCOM).

While SOUTHCOM’s current stated mission is to counter narcotics flows into the US, its growing presence near Venezuela has been interpreted as a sign of Trump’s strategic interest in the region.

What military assets have been deployed?

The military buildup is considerable and includes ready-to-deploy expeditionary forces, US naval and air assets, and special operations units.

Al Jazeera’s Defence Editor, Alex Gatopoulos, said, “It’s already the biggest build-up of US military assets in the region for decades. The present force is oriented for land attack and not for counter-narcotics operations.”

Expeditionary forces

The Iwo Jima Amphibious Ready Group (ARG) forms the expeditionary core of the US presence in the Caribbean. This group of Navy ships carrying marines, vehicles and helicopters, named after the famous World War II battle of Iwo Jima, is designed to land on a shore quickly, often in emergencies or combat situations.

Along with the USS San Antonio (LPD 17) and the USS Fort Lauderdale (LPD 28), the expeditionary force houses 4,500 sailors and marines, including 2,200 marines trained for amphibious assault and rapid reaction missions.

The group has also conducted live-fire drills on board the Iwo Jima and amphibious landing rehearsals off St Croix, the largest of the US Virgin Islands and a key training site for US forces.

Naval assets

The fleet is also reinforced with several naval assets. Late on Friday, the US announced it will send an aircraft carrier strike group to Latin America, in a major escalation of its military presence.

A spokesperson for the US military said that Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth ordered the USS Gerald Ford and five destroyers in its accompanying strike group to deploy to the region.

As of September 25, SOUTHCOM’s task force includes 10 major warships and several support vessels, exceeding the number normally assigned to the region. Among them are four surface combatants and one submarine capable of carrying Tomahawk long-range missiles.

The destroyers, USS Jason Dunham (DDG-109), USS Stockdale (DDG-106) and USS Gravely (DDG-107), are multi-role warships armed with Tomahawk land-attack missiles as well as advanced anti-air and anti-submarine systems. All three were reportedly deployed to the Red Sea in 2024 to counter Houthi attacks in the region.

Alongside them, the USS Newport News (SSN-750), a nuclear-powered fast attack submarine, provides capabilities for strikes, antiship and antisubmarine operations, as well as intelligence, reconnaissance and special operations.

There are also several noncombatant support ships, as well as the US Coast Guard.

Air assets

The air component deployed under SOUTHCOM includes some of the most advanced aircraft in the US Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force.

Gatopoulos states that, added to the various deployments “have been the intimidation tactics of flying strategic bombers close to Venezuelan airspace… The B-52 is designed to destroy land-based targets, from some distance away, usually using long-range cruise missiles.”

These heavy bombers can fly at altitudes of up to 50,000 feet (15,000 metres) and carry cruise missiles or nuclear-capable weapons. They also support naval operations by monitoring the ocean, targeting ships and laying mines.

“The B-1 strategic bomber is designed to penetrate enemy airspace to deliver 37 tonnes of ordnance onto its target. Neither jet is in any way useful for stopping drug-smuggling. This plus President Trump’s public announcement to the CIA to start operations within Venezuela tells me they have something very different in mind, namely to destabilise the Maduro government,” says Gatopoulos.

“The latest development, the ordering of the Gerald Ford Carrier Strike Group to the Caribbean further cements this idea. The Carrier group is immensely powerful, bringing with it 75+ fighter jets, helicopters and early warning aircraft. The USS Ford will be accompanied by three missile destroyers, each capable of attacking targets deep within Venezuela – a huge amount of firepower,” he added.

There are also at least 10 F-35 stealth fighters – highly versatile jets which can strike, fight and gather intelligence while remaining hard to detect by radar.

MQ-9 Reaper drones are remotely piloted aircraft used for surveillance and precision strikes, with a range of 1,851km (1,150 miles) and speeds up to 370km/h (230mph). They can carry up to 16 Hellfire missiles, allowing them to strike multiple targets in a single mission.

CH-53E Super Stallions are heavy-lift helicopters that move troops and equipment from ship to shore. They can carry 16 tonnes of cargo 80km (50 miles) before returning to base.

Other air assets include P-8 Poseidon patrol aircraft, MH-60 Seahawk helicopters, AC-130J gunships, and various support and reconnaissance aircraft.

Special forces and troops

SOUTHCOM’s special operations component consists of MH-60 Black Hawks and AH-MH-6 Little Bird helicopters for troop insertion and reconnaissance. The MC Ocean Trader, which is part of the deployment, acts as a mobile forward base for these units.

About 10,000 troops have also been sent to the US territory of Puerto Rico, while the White House has authorised the CIA to carry out covert operations inside Venezuela.

How has Venezuela responded?

On September 4, two Venezuelan F-16 fighter jets flew over the USS Jason Dunham in what was seen as a highly provocative act, according to Washington. In response, the US deployed 10 F-35B fighters and two MQ-9 Reapers to Puerto Rico.

On September 17, Venezuela launched large-scale naval and air exercises, while President Nicolas Maduro ordered the mobilisation of the Bolivarian militia, a reserve force which is part of Venezuela’s armed forces, the Bolivarian National Armed Forces (FANB), and called for millions of volunteers to defend the country’s sovereignty.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/24/my-late-mother-birthday-nuclear-war-demonstrating,It was my late mother’s birthday – and I spent it exactly as she would have wanted | Zoe Williams,"It would have been my late mother’s birthday last Monday, and because I am either astronomically stupid or fathomlessly wise, I elected to spend it at a public meeting about nuclear disarmament. I’d call it a blast from the past, except I feel superstitious about introducing explode-y words too near the nuclear topic.

I spent my entire childhood worrying about nuclear war, partly because it was the 80s, and everyone did, and partly because we spent our lives demonstrating against it. We had “Protest and Survive” stickers everywhere, in droll parody of the public information booklet “Protect and Survive”, along with “Nuclear Power? No Thanks”. We were also early adopters of climate change anxiety, while fiercely against the closure of coalmines. If you’re wondering where we expected to get our power from, well, obviously we didn’t need central heating: the combination of political fervour and long johns was very warming. When I say we, of course I mean “my mother”; my sister and I had very little agency in this quest for peace.

We did go to Greenham Common, site of the women’s peace camp, but never stayed over, and that’s not the bit that stayed in my mind. I remember endless marches through central London, ending with some speakers – they all seemed to be vicars, except one, who was always Tony Benn. They would describe in exquisite detail all the things a hydrogen bomb would do to your flesh, and the flesh of your loved ones and pets, and then what would happen to the teeth and gums of anyone whose flesh had mysteriously been spared. It strikes me now as a bit medieval – godly men getting excited about mortification. But back then all I thought was: I am bored and terrified at the same time, how is that possible?

The anti-nuclear argument has moved on, changed beyond all recognition, although the personnel hasn’t. Prof Mary Kaldor was a giant in the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND), then its Europe-wide arm, END. She spoke last week, having authored a report which says that the nuclear deterrence paradigm is basically bust. It was an answer to yesterday’s problems – and actually, the cold war began three-quarters of a century ago, so it’s very much the day before yesterday – and today’s threats are different. Our enemies will come at us with hybrid warfare, designed to destroy democracy from within by sowing chaos, disorder and polarisation. Russia could use a drone or a bot farm or a misinformation campaign or £30,000 in the pocket of the now former leader of the Reform party in Wales, but in none of those scenarios would threatening to annihilate a quarter of a million of their civilians be very helpful.

It would be better – and cheaper – Kaldor suggested at the meeting, to build democratic resilience from within. Someone else said later that land armies hate nuclear weapons, because they scorch the territory, make it un-takeable; and the only people who liked nukes were the navy. Then an ex-Marine said: “Are you kidding? The navy hates them too, because they’re so expensive, and there’s no money left for the fun stuff.” I guess he meant boats? Anyway, it was fascinating, but it was also bittersweet, as I could imagine my mum hopping up and down, saying: “But … tell them about the incinerated flesh! This is nothing like scary enough!”

Then the nuclear physicist Patricia Lewis made the elegant argument that no population, given the choice, would ever use a nuclear weapon, and all autocracies knew that: the only way these weapons could work as a real threat is if democracies stopped listening to their people, which is to say, became less democratic. So the real thing nuclear weapons deter is democracy itself. My mother would have loved that, though she definitely would have stood up at the end, saying: “This is more of a statement than a question: why, oh why is nobody talking about radiation sickness?”

Anyway, I marked her birthday equal parts missing her and freshly committed to opposing nuclear obliteration – which is pretty much what she would have wanted.

Al Jazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/25/taliban-says-pakistan-bombed-afghanistan-killing-nine-children-and-a-woman,"Afghanistan says Pakistan bombed Khost, killing nine children and a woman","Government spokesman says the attack in Khost destroyed a civilian home, killing five boys, four girls and a woman.

At least nine children and a woman have been killed after Pakistani forces bombed a house in the country’s southeastern Khost province, according to Afghan authorities.

Zabihullah Mujahid, the spokesman for the Taliban administration, said on Tuesday that the attack took place at midnight (19:30 GMT) in the Gurbuz district of Khost province.

The latest attack risks triggering renewed hostilities and comes as a fragile ceasefire between the two nations hangs by a thread, with each side blaming the other for the impasse in the negotiations.

“The Pakistani invading forces bombed the house of a local civilian resident, Waliat Khan, son of Qazi Mir,” Mujahid wrote in a post on X.

“As a result, nine children [five boys and four girls] and one woman were martyred, and his house was destroyed,” he added.

Other air strikes took place in northeastern Kunar and eastern Paktika provinces, Mujahid said, wounding at least four civilians.

There was no immediate comment from Pakistan.

The bombardment in Afghanistan comes a day after a suicide attack that targeted the headquarters of Pakistan’s paramilitary Federal Constabulary force in Peshawar.

The Jamaat-ul-Ahrar – which is a splinter group of the Pakistan Taliban, known by the acronym TTP – claimed responsibility for that attack.

State broadcaster PTV reported the attackers were Afghan nationals, and President Asif Zardari blamed the “foreign-backed Fitna al-Khawarij” – Islamabad’s term for the TTP fighters it accuses of operating from Afghan soil.

Another suicide attack in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad, earlier this month killed at least 12 people and was also claimed by a faction of the Pakistan Taliban. Pakistan blamed a cell that was “guided at every step by the … high command based in Afghanistan” for the attack on the capital.

Relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan have been fraught since the Taliban swept back to power in 2021, and worsened after deadly border clashes in October that killed about 70 people on both sides.

The fighting ended with a ceasefire brokered by Qatar and Turkiye, but talks in Istanbul failed to produce a lasting deal, with security issues, especially Pakistan’s demand that Kabul curb TTP fighters proving a sticking point.

Pakistan accuses the Taliban of sheltering fighters behind a surge in attacks, including the TTP, which has waged a bloody campaign against the country for years.

In March 2024, when the K-pop girl group NewJeans was awarded group of the year at Billboard's Women in Music event, the crew was presented the honor by the unlikeliest of advocates: country star Lainey Wilson, who hinted at the distance between their respective worlds and this rare opportunity to bridge them. ""It's a place where a gal who grew up in a small farming community in Louisiana gets to shine a light on an incredible group of K-pop performers from halfway across the globe,"" she said, applause roaring out before the group's name was even spoken. Indeed, the prized pony of ADOR, a sub-label of the juggernaut K-pop company HYBE, had spent the previous year affirming itself as an exciting next step in the genre's evolution. Billboard felt like the perfect American institution to recognize this leap: The 2023 EP Get Up had made NewJeans only the second K-pop girl group to top the Billboard 200, after Blackpink. But as the group performed ""Super Shy"" and ""ETA,"" Get Up's hits, the distance between the two units couldn't have been more apparent. Blackpink was the final benchmark of an old K-pop model; NewJeans was a brand new one.

For one thing, there was a profound understatement to the NewJeans performance — members gliding in and out of the lead spot with uncanny precision, distinct from the flamboyant mini-showcases that had come before. The sparkling fits, flowy choreo and muted music were impressive on their own, but the rush was in how seamlessly they worked together, telling a story about style. Where many K-pop groups spend their press runs trying to be all things to all listeners, NewJeans had spent its breakout year building an aesthetic niche to live in. Where some K-pop singles are so obsessed with now-ness that they feel out of time the moment they're born, NewJeans' songs seemed to be angling for something timeless. For a moment, it looked as if the group could be K-pop's future — if not a bellwether then at least a new barometer, and a message to the industry to reconsider how it does business. Yet only a month after the Billboard ceremony, that horizon became clouded in uncertainty: A power struggle erupted within HYBE for control of NewJeans' future, benching the group for over a year and dividing its fanbase. A surprise announcement this month promises that NewJeans will be back, but the long absence leading to this unsteady return has felt, to those paying attention to the genre's scandals over the years, like the latest evidence of a lingering rot.

Even many superfans will tell you that K-pop's pageantry has often masked a troubled business model, where impressionable young trainees commit to a life run entirely by their agencies. Signing on the dotted line can come with extraordinary expectations: plastic surgery, disordered eating, heavy restrictions on socializing. South Korea's Fair Trade Commission finally capped K-pop contracts at seven years after a 2009 controversy around the boy band TVXQ, who coined the term ""slave contract"" to describe its own 13-year agreement. K-pop was also at ground zero for the rise of toxic stan culture, from the doxxing of journalists to the cyberbullying of artists; one such star, Sulli of the girl group f(x), died by suicide in the midst of unrelenting harassment. Concerns over these practices have been a public talking point for years, but reform efforts rarely stick: In 2019, Yang Hyun-suk, co-founder of YG Entertainment, was forced to step down from the label after threatening a whistleblower to cover up a drug allegation facing one of his artists; he has since returned to YG and is helming the girl group Babymonster.

The industry famous for its finely honed artist development method, sometimes called the ""K-pop formula,"" has always lived with this tension: a creative philosophy with proven results, and a near-constant struggle for fairer relations between performers and the adults who oversee them. The latest and most public installment in this fight began last spring, with an outlier act suddenly at the center of the story.

In April 2024, NewJeans found itself caught in a quarrel between two corporate masters. On one side stood the top brass at HYBE, the largest of the country's ""big four"" entertainment agencies since it went public in 2020. On the other was one of their deputies: Min Hee-jin, CEO and founder of ADOR, who had launched NewJeans in 2022 and served as a creative director for its music. An industry veteran by the time she joined HYBE in 2019, Min had arrived touting progressive ideas for managing talent, already positioning her next group as an alternative to K-pop's star system. HYBE had given her the keys, but now alleged that an internal audit revealed she sought to seize total control of ADOR — and took steps to fire her. Min denied such a thing was possible, and claimed the falling-out actually stemmed from her complaints that the company had sidelined NewJeans, stifling its growth in favor of other girl groups it was launching. That August, ADOR announced Min had stepped down as CEO, while the producer insisted she had been forced out.

When asked, in an interview with the English-language newspaper Korea JoongAng Daily, why she and NewJeans were so committed to working together, Min attributed the closeness to her unique style of artist development, saying:

“I have had many thoughts and concerns after nearly 20 years in the entertainment industry. I felt it was crucial to change the rigid dynamic between producers and artists. I was concerned about how to guide young artists in a way that benefits their lives and the industry as a whole. In that context, NewJeans is like a child that comes from my heart and mind. Beyond my personal desire to support them, I aim to establish a new kind of relationship within a business model as a producer. That’s why I’m committed to this challenge and refuse to back down easily.”

Throughout the ordeal, the five members of NewJeans — Minji (now 21), Hanni (21), Danielle (20), Haerin (19) and Hyein (17) — publicly supported Min and called for her reinstatement, saying they would not continue without her. HYBE suggested a compromise: Min could stay on, but in a limited role as a music producer, an offer Min quickly denounced as a mockery of her mission. ""It is contradictory to accuse me of breach of trust while offering me a producer role. I chose to join because HYBE claimed they wanted to create a new wave and flow in K-pop. If those aspects hadn't been guaranteed, I wouldn't have even joined the company,"" she said in an interview with Japan's TV Asahi/ANN News program News Station. The only tenable way forward, she argued, was for her to continue as CEO, managing business and production in tandem.

By then, the issue had grown bigger than Min, with the NewJeans girls voicing their own criticisms of the parent company. Last September, in an impromptu YouTube livestream that played like a hostage video, the members called HYBE inhumane, detailing mistreatment and harassment. A month later, Hanni testified, through tears, before the South Korean National Assembly's Environment and Labor Committee, as a reference witness for an audit being conducted around workplace harassment and artist protection in the entertainment industry. She spoke about discrimination she and her groupmates faced at HYBE, and the resulting distrust. The case was ultimately dismissed, with the committee ruling that members of K-pop groups are not workers, and therefore are not entitled to labor protections.

Finally, on Nov. 28, 2024, NewJeans took matters into its own hands. At a press conference, the members announced the termination of their exclusive contract with ADOR, and vowed to seek the right to continue independently under the NewJeans name. The industry moved swiftly against them, with the Korea Management Federation and Korea Entertainment Producers' Association both siding with the company, the latter calling the act childish. Attempts to freelance under a new name, NJZ, were quickly thwarted. The group performed for the last time in February 2025, headlining at ComplexCon Hong Kong.

It took a year of legal limbo, with the group's musical activities stopped cold, before a pair of decisions put an end to the suspense. On Oct. 30, 2025, Seoul Central District Court ruled in favor of ADOR, saying that NewJeans must honor its contract and stay with the label through 2029. The members initially stuck to their guns, saying in a statement, ""It is impossible to return to ADOR and continue normal entertainment activities under the current situation where the trust relationship with ADOR has completely broken down."" They vowed to appeal the ruling, a case legal experts estimated would not be heard until well into 2026. Then came a twist that few saw coming: On Nov. 12, ADOR announced in a press release that the group's two youngest members, Hyein and Haerin, would be returning to the label, with no word on Minji, Danielle and Hanni. A few hours later, the three holdouts announced their intention to return as well — but through a news article, saying they had contacted ADOR but had not yet heard back. The label's response was a reluctant one: ""We are confirming the authenticity of their intentions.""

That abrupt, staggered homecoming may be the perfect distillation of the conflicting ideologies that have swirled around the group from all sides. Local reports claimed that Hyein's father — who had so strongly opposed their leaving the label that he entered a civil dispute with his wife over legal guardianship, citing a need for an ""environment where Hyein could focus on her career"" — was instrumental in bringing the younger girls back to ADOR. In contrast, The Korea Herald reported that Minji's mother had been a vocal supporter of Min and her position in the fight with HYBE. Meanwhile, Min herelf had moved on, announcing the start of her own indie agency just ahead of the court verdict. But she did release a statement giving her blessing for the group's return to ADOR, with the parting wish that they remain united. ""I can begin anew anywhere. But I believe that NewJeans must remain whole as five,"" Min said. ""I hope the members grow stronger and become an even better NewJeans, and above all, I wish happiness for all five members.""

The end of Min's label experiment points to something bigger at play, a tug-of-war that has long felt inescapable within K-pop. During the peak of the dispute, HYBE and the courts asserted there would be no disruption to the NewJeans operation under the proposed changes. But Min had intentionally designed ADOR, a boutique imprint with NewJeans as its only artist, to run counter to the HYBE system, binding artists' and producers' fates together in ways frankly radical for the genre. ""I wanted to have all of these come together,"" Min told Fast Company, describing the balance of art and commerce that made up her fantasy K-pop outfit. ""My definition of cool music, with my definition of a cool picture, with my definition of a great business. Business is, of course, important because if you don't make money with art, it would be kind of useless.""

Before launching ADOR, Min was one of the defining figures in K-pop aesthetics. As the creative director at SM Entertainment, she styled and designed concepts for Girls' Generation, SHINee, EXO, f(x) and Red Velvet, becoming the highest-paid woman in the industry in the process. ""I accomplished a lot of things when I was at SM, and I left because I was not really satisfied with my life there,"" she told Fast Company. ""But I'm not saying that I came here because I love this company; I needed a place where I could actualize my vision."" The ADOR way — which is to say, the NewJeans blueprint — was to defy what Min called ""conventional K-pop idol grammar"" and create a group for non-fanatics: a smooth, iterative sound that never resolves, snappy enough to generate earworms yet compact enough to not overstay its welcome.

""For most K-pop songs, there's always an intro and then the climax and the tension relieves again, because people think that having loops is boring,"" Min said in that interview. She was specifically referencing NewJeans' club-pop confection ""Super Shy,"" which artfully defies this climax-release principle by converting liquid drum and bass into blissful Powerpuff pizzazz. The song was co-written and -arranged by the Danish singer-songwriter Erika de Casier, and is imbued with her soft-focused, nostalgic take on Y2K-era R&B. In it, you can hear the NewJeans model at full bore: loopy, sugar-rush songcraft accented by airbrushed vocals. But most important is its holism: It is streamlined, even graceful, where many other K-pop recordings feel like Megazord constructions of the myriad artists who work on them. (EXO-K's ""History,"" for example, has two different bridges, one of which feels beamed in from a completely different song.)

The fragmented approach can be its own kind of endearing, but stitching together bits of tracks was not Min's way. ""There is a reason why we have composers make the songs! Sometimes, we'll adjust the top line, but we never go as far as to damage the real intention of the song,"" she said. Min's production MO was pointed defiantly away from the tried and true way of doing things, which took some collaborators by surprise. ""One of the first questions they asked me was, 'Do you listen a lot to K-pop?' "" de Casier told GQ in 2023. ""And I got so nervous and I had to be honest and said, 'No, I haven't yet explored that genre.' And they're like, 'Good, because we want something new. We want something fresh.' ""

K-pop can often sound oddly anachronistic, even when aiming at an explicitly retro sound, but NewJeans spun a mirage of the past into a modern teenage dream. The touchstones weren't unique ('90s streetwear, early aughts American prep, teen dramas), nor were the genres at play (new jack swing, synth-pop, Jersey and Baltimore club, Miami bass, throwback R&B); it was the ways in which they were remixed, the sense of curation and harmony at work and the way it all slotted neatly into a TikTok-induced optimization. A lot has been made of NewJeans' minimalism as a refreshing counter to K-pop maximalism, but the real innovation was its sepia-toned feel: K-pop as a moodboard come alive, revitalizing the old to the point of a full revolution. Some portion of that has to be attributed to the impresario-auteur at the reins and her master plan. ""These days people use the word producer kind of interchangeably as a composer. I'm a producer, but I don't make songs,"" Min said. ""I plan strategies.""

It is only through such acumen that you get the synergy of a dot-com-era obsessive like de Casier calibrating the group's filter for maximum effect. She is far from the first inspired pairing of choice Westerner and ascendant K-pop group — the late SOPHIE produced for ITZY; Carly Rae Jepsen co-wrote an f(x) song; Troye Sivan and Charli XCX worked on music for the giants BTS and TWICE, respectively — but in many of those songs you can often feel the discord of trying to force those artists to adapt to the agencies' market-tested structure. So much of the NewJeans synthesis came from those brought onto the creative team having no clue how K-pop usually works. ""It's hard [for me] to say how their music differs from other K‑pop songs — I think it's better for music critics to comment on that,"" Ylva Dimberg, one of the group's recurring writers and producers, told The Face. The primary NewJeans producer, 250, put forth a theory of K-pop music that seemed to align with the group's mandate: He asked a Swedish friend who headed a K-pop songwriting team what K-pop was, because he didn't really know, and the friend said it could be anything. ""People talk about 'the formula of K-pop.' But I don't really understand that, because K-pop is really just pop music made by Koreans,"" he told Nylon. ""So whatever we do, we don't need to follow any specific rules because no one can tell us something we made isn't K-pop.""

Not following rules seems to be precisely the strategy Min envisioned. To 250's point, the idea of a genre as omnivorous as K-pop having a central sound is ridiculous, but a unique song framework can still stand out. Most NewJeans songs don't have bridges; none have obligatory rap verses. All feel like they have been stripped to their essential parts, stringing hooks together like embroidery floss along a friendship bracelet, and all have a perfect grasp on the balance between Western and Eastern pop sensibilities. Much of that equilibrium seems to begin with the sessions themselves and the collaborators put in the room: a marriage between outsiders from the Korean industry and niche Scandinavian artists, adding up to an unfussy fusionist's phantasmagoria.

NewJeans' ""Supernatural,"" from June 2024, is the last single the group released before its hiatus. YouTube

It should be said: While ADOR's anti-system stance paid off handsomely as a creative ethic, it proved less effective in remaking the industry at the administrative level. Min was never a K-pop socialist — revolutionary by industry standards, certainly, but still longed to be a CEO fronting a business — and in time she inevitably found herself playing by the house rules, subject to the same industry politicking as other K-pop executives. (Among the evidence cited in October's court ruling were unearthed Slack messages from Min ordering subordinates to dig up dirt on other HYBE artists, which the court saw as grounds to declare breach of trust, misuse of personal information, infringement of trade secrets, defamation and abuse of power.) No one person could overhaul the entire enterprise, but Min's undoing feels like an especially revealing lesson in the limits of the master's tools.

K-pop is a copycat league. Not just in the musical sense — as when Girls' Generation ripped Duffy's ""Mercy"" for its own ""Dancing Queen,"" or when myriad K-pop groups followed the success of ""Despacito"" down the reggaeton rabbit hole — but also in its efforts to recreate the tactics of anything that brings in audiences (hence ""the K-pop formula,"" which is about replicating the paces of idol assembly down to the members' roles). The space vacated by NewJeans has been tough to fill, but that doesn't mean there haven't been one-off attempts to take a few laps in its lane. In Illit, a HYBE sister group whom Min accused of ripping off NewJeans wholesale, you can hear the same collage-like principle on songs like ""Magnetic"" and ""jellyous."" Olivia Marsh, the literal sister of NewJeans' Danielle, tunes her ""Strategy"" to a similar turn-of-the-millenium frequency. Several songs, from ifeye's ""IRL"" and HITGS' ""SOURPATCH"" to VIVIZ's ""Full Moon"" and izna's ""BEEP,"" have tried to recreate the bubblegum bass vibe of skipping rhythms and lush, light vocals; even TWICE got in on the fun last year. Others, like Hearts2Hearts' ""Blue Moon"" and RESCENE's ""Deja Vu,"" conjure the dreamy, rosy-eyed R&B-lite. All of these attempts are serviceable; many are even pleasant. But none quite recreate the mojo.

The contrast is, at least partly, in the roadmap. Min made an organizational practice of stockpiling good, complete songs and figuring out what to do with them later, whereas the traditional K-pop process involves building an elaborate concept around a plug-and-play single and treating it as a peg for months of extended rollout activities. NewJeans didn't do isolated campaigns or tossed-off B-sides; everything served the broader group architecture, something not to be taken for granted in K-pop's LARPing ecosystem, where artists transform between promo cycles. (Just look at the jarring transition from LE SSERAFIM's posed, subtle, disco-inflected ""Hot"" to the campy, lurid, rap-forward ""Spaghetti."") Min once said that the music itself was the concept with NewJeans, and simple as that seems, it's a key part of the group's appeal: There was an identifiable and qualifiable NewJeans sound, one that was singular and exclusive. It was clear what a New Jeans song was, and — just as crucially — what it wasn't, to the point of feeling intuitive. The group did all of the things inherent to K-pop groups, but it did so with a sense of taste top of mind.

The worst K-pop can feel like bad product placement: odious in its lack of subtlety, putting the commerce front and center and pretending otherwise, treating its ""idols"" like collectible dolls to generate shareholder value. It would be disingenuous to suggest that NewJeans was in any way immune to the genre's hazards of investment opportunity or marketing front — the video for ""ETA"" is an ad for the iPhone 14 Pro — but the group's promotion was far less gauche; it was purposeful, even, and shrewd in its movements. It was the influencer ideal: the mere presence doing much of the selling, of a vibe more than a commodity. There was a naturalness, at odds with the usual K-pop posturing, and the styling and choreography were in complete alignment with the music, which was clearly the main attraction. That is, perhaps, why this battle feels particularly distressing in an industry that is no stranger to scandal and corporate malpractice. It is disorienting for K-pop's most actualized act to become the face of its dysfunction.

It's impossible to say whether this is the beginning of the end for NewJeans. Perhaps, years from now, Min Hee-jin's dismissal will feel like the official death knell — or maybe it will be a blip in an otherwise successful career at ADOR. But it's also tempting to think of the what-ifs — the artistic and workplace breakthroughs that could have been made at the key turning points of this saga. What might the NewJeans arc have been had it continued uninterrupted, and could it have ushered in a new K-pop paradigm, or at least an alternative to the norm? What might the business look like had the Environment and Labor Committee heard Hanni's testimony as an elegy, a plea to bury the old ways? Min once mused, ""It can be scary to suggest something different. But once the suggestion is accepted, I think that's what writes new history."" Before us now is the other side of that coin: the suggestion rejected, the door closed on renewal, and a group once defined by its counterculture ethos headed back to the assembly line, to resume performing as though nothing has changed. K-pop is reliant on a blissful suspension of disbelief, the stage as a whimsical little pocket world — but it's hard to imagine the many layers of strained relationships here won't taint the NewJeans fantasy in ways that cannot be ignored.

In a recent interview with the Associated Press, SM Entertainment founder Lee Soo-man — Min's former boss and a key player in K-pop's global expansion — was asked his thoughts on the genre's darker controversies, from which his own company had scarcely been immune. (Recall TVXQ's ""slave contract"" controversy and Sulli's suicide — both SM artists.) Lee responded with another question: ""Should we always weigh the dark side equally with the bright side, the future?"" he asked. ""Media should consider whether K-pop represents more future or more past that holds us back. Rather than just discussing the dark side and dragging us down by clinging to the past, shouldn't we talk more about the future?"" I've been thinking about that a lot since I read it. It's a question premised on the idea that the past and future are partitioned from each other, and that the darkness is all in the rearview mirror. Yet if the NewJeans gauntlet is any indication, those tribulations are still far closer to us than they appear.",2025-11-18 00:00:00,irony,"Ironic quotes around ""s response was a reluctant one: "" with negative context",irony,figurative,1,figurative,0.007136235,0.99286383,0.99286383,True

A number of officers were told they would be released from reserve duty and would no longer serve in the military, the military said in a statement. Others were issued formal reprimands while one was informed that their service would be ended. Another tendered his resignation.

Those informed that they would be released from reserve duty included the former heads of intelligence directorate, operations directorate, and southern command, which is responsible for Gaza. The generals had previously resigned from active service but remained on reserve duty.

“The IDF failed in its primary mission on October 7th — to protect the civilians of the State of Israel,” Israeli military chief of staff Eyal Zamir said, referring to the Israel Defense Forces.

“This is a severe, resounding, systemic failure, relating to decisions and conduct on the eve of the event and during it. The lessons of that day are numerous and significant, and they must serve as our compass for the future toward which I intend to lead the IDF.”

The latest disciplinary steps come as Israeli officials face mounting public pressure over accountability for the failures that led to the attack.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government has not yet opened a national inquiry into the Oct. 7 attack. Thousands of protesters were joined by opposition leaders in Tel Aviv on Saturday night demanding a state commission of inquiry.

The assault by Hamas and other Palestinian factions killed around 1,200 people in Israel and saw some 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies.

The attack triggered Israel‘s ground and air campaign in Gaza, which has devastated large parts of the enclave and killed more than 69,000 people, according to local health authorities.

A question hung over this week's meeting between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. What would President Zelenskyy wear to the Oval Office?

Last February, Ukraine's president wore a black Henley shirt to the White House, no jacket, keeping the bunker-chic look he's maintained since the 2022 Russian invasion. But the meeting got combative.

President Trump chastised President Zelenskyy as ungrateful for U.S. support. A reporter for a right-wing cable channel called out, ""Why don't you wear a suit? You're at the highest level in this country's office, and you refused to wear a suit… do you own a suit?""

President Trump ended the meeting and said of the Ukrainian president on social media, ""He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office.""

This week, President Zelenskyy changed his look. He wore a black canvas blazer over a black collared shirt, buttoned at the top. Still no tie — but his solemn clothing seemed to proclaim: let's have a serious conversation.

Even the reporter who panned his February wardrobe told Zelenskyy he looked ""fabulous."" President Trump added, ""I said the same thing."" President Zelenskyy told the reporter, ""And you're in the same suit. You see, I changed, you have not.""

Yes, men can get weary of being judged by the cut of their clothes, not the cut of their jibs.

Sam Schube, who covered the fashion aspect of the Oval Office meeting for The Wall Street Journal told us, ""I'm not sure there's such a thing as a non-political outfit — everything politicians wear, no matter how bland, sends a message.""

Winston Churchill famously wore an air-raid suit when he visited the White House in December, 1941, just after the United States had been attacked at Pearl Harbor. It reminded Americans that Britons were being bombed in their homes, and Europe faced a life-or-death crisis.

Sam Schube says President Zelenskyy has been working with a Ukrainian designer so that his clothing in public appearances, ""blends his wartime style with something a bit more formal. He looks like he's dressing not just for battle, but high-stakes endgame diplomacy.""

Al Jazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/23/map-of-gaza-shows-where-israeli-forces-are-positioned-under-ceasefire-deal,Map of Gaza shows where Israeli forces are positioned under ceasefire deal,"Satellite imagery analysis by Al Jazeera’s fact-checking agency Sanad shows that the Israeli army holds about 40 active military positions in the part of the Gaza Strip outside the yellow line, the invisible boundary established under the first phase of the ceasefire to which its troops had to move, according to the deal.

The images also show that Israel is upgrading several of these facilities, which help it maintain its occupation of 58 percent of Gaza even after the pullback by troops to the yellow line.

While the majority of sites are concentrated in southern Gaza, every governorate hosts at least one military position. Some sites are built on bases established during the war, while others are newly constructed. The total number of sites in each governorate is:

North Gaza: 9

Gaza City: 6

Deir el-Balah: 1

Khan Younis: 11

Rafah: 13

One of the most prominent military points in Gaza City is located on top of al-Muntar Hill in the Shujayea neighbourhood of Gaza City. A comparison of images between September 21 and October 14 shows the base being paved and asphalted.

Where is the invisible yellow line?

Since the ceasefire took effect about two weeks ago, nearly 100 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli attacks across the Strip, with some attacks occurring near the yellow line.

On October 18, Israeli forces killed 11 members of the Abu Shaaban family in the Zeitoun neighbourhood of Gaza City, according to Gaza’s Civil Defence. Seven children and three women were among those killed when the Israeli military fired on the vehicle as the family attempted to return home to inspect it.

The Israeli military said soldiers had fired at a “suspicious vehicle” that had crossed the so-called yellow line. With no physical markers for the line, however, many Palestinians cannot determine the location of this invisible boundary. Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz has since said the army will install visual signs to indicate the line’s location.

In the first ceasefire phase, Israel retains control of more than half of the Gaza Strip, with areas beyond the yellow line still under its military presence. This has blocked residents of Beit Lahiya, Beit Hanoon, the neighbourhoods of Shujayea, Tuffah, Zeitoun, most of Khan Younis, and all of Rafah City from returning home.

What are the next phases of Trump’s 20-point Gaza plan?

According to the 20-point plan announced by United States President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on September 29 – developed without any Palestinian input – Israel is to withdraw its forces in three phases, as shown on an accompanying crude map, with each phase marked in a different colour:

Initial withdrawal (yellow line): In the first phase, Israeli forces pulled back to the line designated in yellow on the map. Hamas has released all living Israeli captives that were in Gaza, and most of the dead bodies of captives who passed away in the enclave.

In the first phase, Israeli forces pulled back to the line designated in yellow on the map. Hamas has released all living Israeli captives that were in Gaza, and most of the dead bodies of captives who passed away in the enclave. Second withdrawal (red line): During the second phase, an International Stabilisation Force (ISF) will be mobilised to oversee security and support Palestinian policing, while Israeli forces are to retreat further to the line marked in red, reducing their direct presence in Gaza.

During the second phase, an International Stabilisation Force (ISF) will be mobilised to oversee security and support Palestinian policing, while Israeli forces are to retreat further to the line marked in red, reducing their direct presence in Gaza. Third withdrawal (security buffer zone): In the final phase, Israeli forces are to pull back to a designated “security buffer zone”, leaving a limited portion of Gaza under Israeli military control, while an international administrative body supervises governance and a transitional period.

Even after the third withdrawal phase, Palestinians will be confined to an area which is smaller than before the war, continuing a pattern of Israel’s control over Gaza and its people.

Many questions remain about how the plan will be implemented, the exact boundaries of Palestinian territory, the timing and scope of Israeli withdrawals, the role of the ISF, and the long-term implications for Palestinians across Gaza and the occupied West Bank.

The plan is also silent on whether Israel gets to continue its aerial and sea blockade of Gaza, which has been in place for the past 18 years.",2025-10-23 00:00:00,literal,Factual reporting on reporting and political figures,literal,literal,0,literal,0.95529646,0.04470353,0.95529646,True

Pop music is full of references to denim — from the opening lyrics of Elton John's ""Tiny Dancer"" — ""Blue jean baby"" — to Flo Rida's ode to an Apple Bottoms pair in ""Low.""

But musicians don't just sing about jeans. They also live in them. And those garments sometimes reveal intriguing details about the people who wear them, as the new Amped: Music Icons in Levi's Denim exhibition at Levi's headquarters in San Francisco shows.

One of the exhibition's marquee items is a pair of Levi's 501s once owned by Kurt Cobain. The late Nirvana frontman's jeans set a Guinness World Record in 2023 when they sold for more than $412,750 at a Nashville auction.

Tracey Panek was there. ""I was bidding on it,"" Levi's in-house historian and archivist told NPR. ""But sadly one of my rivals got it.""

YouTube

The winning bidder, private collector Tom Coyne, agreed to loan the jeans to Levi's for the exhibition. Cobain wore them on many occasions during the 1990s, including on the video for ""Heart-Shaped Box."" They show a lot of wear. There are heavy stains, rips and patches, including a colorful psychedelic print lining the hem.

""They're just a signature grunge-looking pair of jeans,"" Panek said.

The pants also tell more subtle stories.

Panek points to faded, upside-down lettering on the right leg — a four-letter word beginning with F — scribbled on a patch. While the artist was famously a left-handed guitarist, Panek said the scrawl suggests Cobain was actually ambidextrous. ""You can tell he was writing with his right hand while he was seated,"" she said.

Other pieces in the exhibition offer very different portraits of their famous owners.

The sharp creases in a pair of slim-fitting, light blue jeans once owned by Freddie Mercury say something about the Queen vocalist's fastidiousness. ""I think he ironed these,"" Panek said.

Meanwhile a rhinestone-festooned, western-style denim pants and matching jacket worn by Beyoncé in a recent Levi's advertising campaign highlight Queen Bey's penchant as a performer for upending traditional white, male tropes. ""She challenges a pool shark to a shootout,"" said Panek, describing one of the ads set to Beyoncé's 2024 song ""Levii's Jeans."" ""Of course, she wins hands down, and demands that her rival give up his Levi's.""

Mary Davis, a fashion historian and musicologist at Yale University, said musicians use denim in many different ways to construct identity and share messages.

""There's a way in which you can see denim being almost a blank canvas for anything that anybody wants to make it,"" Davis said.

Davis points to Bruce Springsteen's 1984 album Born in the U.S.A., with its songs about the struggles of the working class – and its memorable album cover. It shows Springsteen from behind in worn blue Levi's, a white T-shirt and a red baseball cap stuffed into a back pocket.

Davis said the photograph draws a potent line between denim's 19th century workwear roots and the troubadour of late twentieth century labor. ""He's making a statement there,"" Davis said.

That’s what it was like to be part of Cop30 in Brazil. And yet more than 190 countries came together in the rainforest of the Amazon and reaffirmed their faith in multilateralism, the Paris agreement and the need to redouble our efforts to keep global warming to 1.5C.

We went to Cop because working with other countries to tackle the climate crisis is the only way to protect our home and way of life. We know the UK produces just 1% of emissions, which is why, as the prime minister said in Belém, our government is “all-in” on working with others to reduce the remaining 99%.

We also know there are huge opportunities from driving the transition forward, which is why in Britain we are making historic investments in renewables and nuclear, upgrading millions of homes, and acting to protect nature.

It is true that Britain wanted more from this Cop, including details of how we would speed up the global energy transition through an agreement that explicitly pledged a roadmap for the transition away from fossil fuels. This didn’t happen because some countries would not agree.

Yet on this issue, we have seen the emergence of an impressive coalition of 83 countries from the global north and global south, backed by more than 140 global businesses and civil society groups. And Brazil will launch a roadmap to help countries transition away from fossil fuels and scale up clean energy.

This offers such an important lesson: that detailed negotiations matter, but the movements we build around them profoundly influence what can be delivered. The roadmap to achieve our goal to halt and reverse deforestation by 2030 offers the same opportunity to drive forward our global efforts to tackle the nature and climate crises together.

There is also a larger picture here. This year’s summit was a test of whether, at a time of political challenge, countries would keep working together on the greatest collective threat we face or, with the US stepping out of the Paris agreement, there might be a domino effect of others departing. For all the challenges, countries chose the path of cooperation.

Cop30 therefore forms part of the long history of these negotiations that have seen the world change its trajectory from 4C of warming around a decade ago to 2.3- 2.5C. Despite that progress, our goal is 1.5C for a reason – because the science is clear that every fraction of a degree matters in limiting the impacts people will face here and around the world. That is why it is important that the world has pledged to enhance efforts to meet it through the Belém Mission to 1.5 and Global Implementation Accelerator.

Ambition on emissions reduction goes hand-in-hand with finance to make that possible, including for developing countries. Last year, countries agreed that, by 2035, we would need to mobilise at least $300bn (£230bn) of climate finance annually for developing countries. This year, as a core part of our fight against climate change, we agreed that this finance needs to be targeted at aiming to treble the support to building resilience to climate impacts.

Our Brazilian hosts were determined to make this the implementation Cop – and much progress was made outside the negotiating halls. This was, of course, the first Cop in the Amazon, and the UK was proud to work with Brazil in the two years running up to the summit to help it develop the Tropical Forest Forever Facility, which offers an incredibly inspiring solution to global deforestation.

We also worked alongside Brazil and many others on the Global Climate Action Agenda, which is about building the coalitions spanning governments, businesses, cities and civil society needed to accelerate action on the ground – on issues from reducing methane emissions and phasing out coal, to unlocking investment in clean energy.

Thousands of British businesses were involved in these initiatives. Our researchers, universities, mayors and others were also deeply engaged on climate issues at this Cop. And the UK was key to delivering the final outcomes of this summit, because of our record of climate leadership at home and abroad, as well as the extraordinary skill and determination of our civil service.

The message coming out of Belém was clear: despite the noise, clean energy and climate action remain the foundation on which the global economy is being remade and rebuilt. We are up against the march of time and massive global forces that would slow down or stop action. In the face of this opposition, multilateralism is our best hope.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/24/war-on-terror-venezuela-donald-trump,The US ‘war on terror’ has killed millions. Now Trump is bringing it to Venezuela,"For the last two months, US forces have amassed outside Venezuela and carried out a series of lethal strikes on civilian boats. The Trump White House has ordered these actions in the name of fighting “narco-terrorists” – a label apparently applicable to anyone suspected of participating in drug trafficking near Latin American coastlines. More than 80 people have already been killed in these pre-emptive strikes, and war hawks are calling for expanded military action to depose the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro.

Watching this play out, I am reminded of a passage from the geographer Stuart Elden’s award-winning 2009 book, Terror and Territory. In discussing how to study the “war on terror”, Elden observed that it did not make sense to study terrorism as something unique to non-state actors.

“States clearly operate in ways that terrify,” Elden said. “The terrorism of non-state actors is a very small proportion of terrorism taken as a whole, with states having killed far more than those who oppose them.”

A large body of research supports this claim.

Researchers with Brown University’s Costs of War project, for example, have found that US-led interventions in the “war on terror” from 2001 to 2023 killed over 400,000 civilians in direct war violence. They also show evidence that when considering indirect deaths – for example, people in war zones dying from treatable medical conditions after clean water or medical infrastructure was destroyed – death toll estimates rise to at least 3.5m. Moreover, even beyond direct war zones, a recent study in the Lancet found that sanctions during the same period were also extremely deadly, causing as many as 500,000 excess deaths per year from 2010 to 2021.

We have already spent decades terrorizing civilian populations around the world in the name of fighting terror

In short, we have already spent decades terrorizing civilian populations around the world in the name of fighting terror. This is well known, and yet the Trump White House is reinvigorating the “war on terror” anyway. Still more, it is trying to do it with even less oversight on the president’s license to kill than has been exercised in the past.

While on the surface Trump’s second term has been characterized by a disorienting barrage of executive orders and culture war polemics, the administration has in fact been running a cohesive authoritarian playbook aimed at conferring near limitless powers to the presidency. These concerted efforts have played out in numerous policy arenas from immigration, to higher education, to economics, to even determining who is a citizen.

Consistent with this pattern, Trump is asserting the same unchecked authority over the violent capacities of the US military.

As I have written previously, a key tactic of the Trump White House has been eviscerating the oversight of the courts, making it impossible to impede the executive branch from continuing to break the law, even when it gets caught red-handed. However, another frequent strategy – perhaps less visible, though equally anathema to a system of limited government – has been to simply sidestep oversight by asserting that, even when law in theory places limits on presidential power, the exercise of this power is still “unquestioned”; according to this thinking, the executive branch apparently has the prerogative to interpret what those limits are.

Of course, in a serious constitutional system, this would be preposterous. In practice, there would be no limits to presidential powers, rendering the constitution moot. Nonetheless, this is exactly the type of power that Trump is asserting over the military, both at home and abroad.

The court case related to Trump’s efforts to suppress protests in Chicago using troops sheds critical light on how this strategy works. Federal law allows a president to deploy troops domestically if there is a “rebellion” that is making it impossible to “execute the laws of the United States”. Accordingly, some lower court judges have reasonably blocked the deployment of troops, finding that the administration has been unable to prove that these conditions were met. Just look at the facts: protests had on average only been about 50 people at a time, and they have clearly not made law enforcement impossible since ICE – the federal agency being protested – has vastly increased arrests during this time.

True to form, however, Trump’s lawyers have argued that these details are irrelevant. In their view, there is actually no need to prove a rebellion is happening because the president has the authority to define rebellion anyway. In other words, the law might impose limits on how the president can use the military, but the president gets to decide what those limits are.

While lower courts have so far prevented this nakedly authoritarian legal theory from taking hold, the argument itself is still massively consequential: first, because an extremely Trump-friendly supreme court will hear the case soon and could very well endorse these claims; and second, because this is essentially the same logic that the Trump administration has used to justify killing civilians off the Latin American coast. Indeed, just as the Trump administration is asserting the exclusive right to define “rebellion” regardless of the facts on the ground – thus eliminating any real limits on the power to deploy troops domestically – the Trump White House is similarly asserting the unencumbered right to define “terrorist”, along with the corresponding right to take deadly action with virtually no outside oversight.

In public statements, Trump has defended treating drug smugglers as terrorists by citing the harm done by drug overdoses, in effect suggesting that drug traffickers are directly killing US citizens. Ignoring the fact that Venezuela doesn’t produce fentanyl, the main driver of overdoses in the US, Trump has even gone so far as to float the mathematically impossible claim that each boat strike has saved 25,000 lives. Of course, officials have provided zero public evidence that the boats attacked were carrying drugs at all, much less tried to explain how blowing up boats would have any impact at all on drug abuse in the US.

But again, why would they? The whole point of the argument is that such facts don’t matter because Trump simply has the unchecked authority to use lethal force. In fact, the justice department has suggested that officials do not even have to publicly list which foreign organizations are classified as killable terrorists, much less provide evidence to support this designation.

Ultimately, Trump’s actions in and around Venezuela are best understood as a new phase in the “war on terror” – an ongoing tragedy that has already had deadly consequences for millions – though now with even fewer guardrails. The bottom line: Venezuela is not just some chess piece in an abstract game of geopolitics, and we are doing a disservice to humanity if we let war hawks in government and media spin it this way. We are talking about real people, and as very recent history shows, countless lives are at stake.",2025-11-24 00:00:00,literal,Factual reporting on reporting and data,literal,literal,0,literal,0.7785663,0.22143371,0.7785663,True
Al Jazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/31/the-new-york-city-mayoral-race-in-five-maps-and-charts,The New York City mayoral race – in five maps and charts,"New York’s mayor election has drawn global attention as it pits progressivism against populism and establishment power.

It’s a dramatic race to the finish line between traditional politics and a new-age, people-powered-social-media-powered campaign, as New York City prepares to vote for its next mayor.

New Yorkers will head to the polls on November 4 as a three-way mayoral race, between Democrat Zohran Mamdani, former Democratic governor and now independent Andrew Cuomo, and Republican Curtis Sliwa, draws global attention.

New York City holds mayoral elections every four years, with a two-term limit for any individual. But this year’s contest is notable for its three-way dynamic, bringing progressive, establishment and conservative forces to face off in the country’s largest city.

Here are five maps and charts to help you understand New York City and how the vote works.

How big is New York City?

New York City is the most populous city in the United States, with a population of nearly 8.5 million people as of July 2024.

It is also the most densely populated city in the country, with about 11,314 residents per square kilometre (29,303 residents per square mile).

The East Coast city comprises five boroughs, which are administrative divisions equivalent to counties.

They include:

The Bronx: The birthplace of hip-hop and home to Yankee Stadium. It is also home to 1.35 million people across 110sq km (42sq miles). The annual median income is $28,664, while renting a one-bedroom apartment costs $2,100 on average per month, making that about $25,200 annually.

Brooklyn: Known for its arts scene, quirky, diverse neighbourhoods, and the Brooklyn Bridge. It is home to 2.56 million people across 180sq km (71sq miles). Brooklyn has the third-highest annual median income of the five boroughs at $41,171, and a one-bedroom apartment averages $2,800 per month, which makes $33,600 annually.

Manhattan: The economic and cultural centre of the city, home to Wall Street, Broadway, and Central Park, it’s a main character in many US television shows and movies. It is home to 1.59 million people across 59sq km (23sq miles). Manhattan has the highest annual median income of $61,439 but also has the highest rental rates, averaging $4,200 per month for a one-bedroom apartment, which is $50,400 per year.

Queens: The largest of the boroughs and home to two major airports – JFK International and LaGuardia. It is also home to 2.56 million people across 280sq km (109 sq miles). The annual median income is $40,549 and renting a one-bedroom apartment costs $2,700 per month on average, almost $32,400 annually.

Staten Island: Accessible by ferry from Lower Manhattan, this historic suburban borough, known for its parks and historical sites, is home to nearly 500,000 people across 152sq km (59sq miles). The annual median income is the second highest at $47,218, and renting a one-bedroom apartment costs $2,000 per month on average, which is $24,000 per year.

Together, the five boroughs cover a surface area of about 778.2 square kilometres (300 square miles) which is about the same size as Memphis in Tennessee, Berlin in Germany, or Singapore.

Who are New Yorkers?

At 38.8 years, New York City’s median age is slightly lower than the national median age of 39.2, reflecting its younger, more urban population.

The largest age group in New York City is that of 30-34 year olds (8.49 percent), followed by 25-29 year olds (8.02 percent), and 35-39 year olds (7.26 percent). Together, they make up nearly a quarter of the city’s total population.

New York City has slightly more females (4.29 million) than males (3.96 million).

New York City is widely regarded as one of the most diverse cities in the world, with residents speaking more than 200 languages.

According to City of New York data, 37 percent of New Yorkers were born outside the United States, and as many as 49 percent speak a language other than English at home.

Additionally, almost half of the city’s businesses are owned by immigrants.

At the time of the 2020 census, 30.9 percent of New Yorkers were white, followed by Hispanics at 28.3 percent, Blacks at 20.2 percent, and Asians at 15.6 percent. Residents identifying as two or more races, or other groups, including Native Americans, Pacific Islanders, and Hawaiians, make up the remaining five percent of the city.

The different boroughs, however, do not replicate citywide numbers, which vary greatly, and according to the 2020 census, are as follows:

Brooklyn population: 2.73 million

White: 35.4%

Black: 26.7%

Some other race: 0.8%

New York City is one of 27 US cities holding mayoral elections on November 4.

The current mayor, Democrat Eric Adams, who has been in office since January 2022, withdrew his candidacy earlier in the year following several controversies, most notably his federal criminal indictment on bribery and conspiracy charges, which was ultimately dismissed by a judge in April.

The last non-Democratic mayor of New York City was Republican Rudy Giuliani, who was elected in 1993 and served two terms until 2001. Since then, the city has consistently chosen Democratic mayors, including Michael Bloomberg (2002-2023), Bill de Blasio (2014-2021) and Eric Adams.

Following primary elections within the two major parties, the three leading contenders for mayor are now: Zohran Mamdani, 34; Andrew Cuomo, 67; and Curtis Sliwa, 71.

Zohran Kwame Mamdani, 34

Mamdani is the Democratic Party candidate and also endorsed by the progressive Working Families Party.

An immigrant, Muslim and Democratic Socialist, Mamdani’s campaign has been focused on making New York more affordable, with rent freezes, free universal childcare and lower public transport costs.

Mamdani has been serving as a member of the State Assembly since 2021. His popularity has risen hugely over the past year, as the mayoral campaigns have got under way and, now, as early voting has begun. Nearly 370,000 ballots have already been cast as of Thursday.

The millennial candidate has appealed greatly to younger voters. On Sunday, he addressed a crowd of 13,500 people at the Forest Hills Stadium in Queens, with a promise that “New York isn’t for sale” – meaning it should be owned by the people generally, not by corporations and the “billionaire class”. Mamdani was joined by long-term Democratic Socialist senator, Bernie Sanders, and Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, New York congresswoman who won congressional elections in 2018 with record numbers.

Andrew Cuomo, 65

The independent candidate was New York’s Democratic Governor from 2011-2021, and served as the attorney general of New York from 2007-2010, US secretary of housing and urban development from 1997-2001, and assistant secretary of housing and urban development from 1993-1997.

The government stalwart has decades of federal and state-level political experience, but in his last term as New York governor, he was accused by 13 women of sexual harassment and was forced to step down from office.

An independent investigation by the Office of the New York State Attorney General concluded that Cuomo had sexually harassed multiple women. This included unwanted touching, kissing and hugging, inappropriate comments, and retaliation against at least one complainant.

Initially, Cuomo ran as a Democratic candidate for mayor, but lost in the primaries to Mamdani. Cuomo received 43.61 percent of the votes, and Mamdani 56.39 percent.

Cuomo’s political experience may resonate with older voters but, according to all the major polls, Mamdani is at least 10 points ahead of him.

In April, the New York City Campaign Finance Board (CFB), the campaign finance regulator, found Cuomo’s campaign had not provided evidence of digital donations, a requirement to qualify for public funds.

Cuomo’s campaign lost out on nearly $3 million in public funds as a result of this.

Then, in May, the CFB fined his campaign $675,000 for “improper coordination” with a supporting Super PAC.

Cuomo has been supported by billionaires William P Lauder, Barry Diller, Michael Kors and Michael Bloomberg.

How the voting works

Since early voting began on October 25, almost 300,000 ballots have already been submitted. So far, Mamdani has maintained a 10-point lead over Cuomo, according to the Quinnipiac University Poll. The RealClearPolitics average has Mamdani leading at 46 percent, followed by Cuomo at 30.5 percent, and Sliwa trailing at 16.6 percent.

Unlike in the primaries, in which voters rank their choices, New York City voters will mark just one choice for mayor. Candidates are listed by party on the ballot paper, so some appear more than once if they have been endorsed by more than one.

As of February, there were 5.1 million registered voters in New York City, of whom 65 percent were Democrats and 11 percent were Republicans. About 1.1 million voters were not registered with any party and voter registration closed on October 25, one week before the November 4 election.

In the last New York City mayoral election, just more than 1.1 million voters cast ballots – about 21 percent of registered voters.

To be eligible to vote, residents of New York must:

Be a US citizen

Have been a New York City resident for at least 30 days

Be at least 18 years old (you may pre-register at 16 or 17, but can’t vote until you’re 18)

Not be in prison for a felony conviction

Must not have been judged mentally incompetent by a court

Not have registered to vote elsewhere.

When do polls open and close?

Polling stations will be open between the hours of 6am (10:00 GMT) and 9pm (01:00 GMT on November 5) on November 4.

Timings vary from location to location in the city, but polling stations open between 8am and 10am and close between 4pm and 9pm.

Early voting began on October 25 and will end on November 2.

A full list of polling stations open for early voting is available on the Board of Elections in the City of New York website.

What else are New Yorkers voting for?

New Yorkers will also cast votes for the positions of public advocate and comptroller in citywide elections. Many districts will also choose a new borough president, City Council seats, judges and other local offices.

In addition to that, voters must vote in favour of or against the following proposals on the ballot:",2025-10-31 00:00:00,literal,Factual reporting on reporting and data,literal,literal,0,literal,0.9440709,0.055929095,0.9440709,True
Al Jazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/features/longform/2025/11/12/myanmars-urban-assassins-the-fighters-hunted-by-the-military,Myanmar’s urban assassins: The fighters hunted by the military,"WATCH: A video provided by a former military guard shows soldiers torturing two detainees at an infantry base in Mandalay region in October 2021.

Al Jazeera has also gathered testimonies from several military defectors who confirm that deaths in custody are common.

A senior officer, “AK”, who asked for a pseudonym to protect his identity, defected from the military after being forced to take part in an extrajudicial killing operation. He alleges that the murder of captured urban fighters is sanctioned at the highest level.

AK described a night in early 2024 when four suspected urban fighters were bound, blindfolded and taken away from one of the military’s deadliest interrogation facilities.

The four prisoners, suspected assassins, were tortured so badly that they had to be propped up by soldiers as they were taken to a waiting pickup truck. Surrounded by armed guards, the four were then transported to a quiet road away from the city and forced to kneel beside a ditch.

AK said a senior officer ordered the soldiers to shoot the men with pistols to avoid unnecessary noise.

The suspects were shot from behind, AK said, but they did not die immediately. As the rebels bled on the ground, the soldiers grew restless waiting for them to die, so they shot them again, then again.

“I don’t think they knew that was the moment they would die, until they heard bullets … their deaths were so brutal I couldn’t sleep for a week,” AK told Al Jazeera.

The men’s bodies were then transferred to a military hospital, where AK says doctors signed certificates that obscured their cause of death. Medical staff employed by the military are often pressured to cover up such murders, he says.

Al Jazeera has seen photos of three of the men’s bodies, along with leaked copies of the official death report, which says they were killed while trying to escape. The injuries visible in the photos do not match that claim. One photo, AK pointed out, shows one of the men with his eyes covered and his hands tied, challenging the account that he had been trying to get away.

Claiming that prisoners were killed while trying to flee is a common narrative used by the military to cover up extrajudicial killings, the former senior officer said.

Some of the details about the executions that AK shared have been omitted here due to concern about reprisals. But to verify this incident, Al Jazeera triangulated testimonies and leaked documents with local media reports and interviews with former military and civil society organisation sources.

Critically, AK explained such murders could not take place without the approval of senior military officials.

“No one could leave that detention centre without approval from the top,” he said.

Al Jazeera also spoke with two former army doctors who served on different bases after the coup. Both said they were prevented from providing medical attention to civilians aligned with the resistance who had serious injuries. After the coup, they said, it became common practice for senior military doctors to fake the causes of death of detainees who had been killed or left to die in custody.

The doctors, who requested anonymity, confirmed that such cover-ups by military leaders are both organised and strategic, allowing detainees to be murdered or left to die while the regime avoids accountability.

WATCH: Former army doctors describe being forced to leave detainees to die and made to falsify causes of death in custody.

AYESHA RASCOE, HOST:

Folks, if you can, get out a pen and paper because we're about to talk about some of our favorite books of the year, and you might want to jot a few of these titles down. With us to talk about NPR's annual interactive books roundup, Books We Love, is Andrew Limbong, host of NPR's Book Of The Day podcast. Thanks for being with us.

ANDREW LIMBONG, BYLINE: Hey, Ayesha.

RASCOE: We love this time of year. But for listeners who aren't familiar, tell them about Books We Love.

LIMBONG: It is not just, like, a best of - here's the 10 best books you've got to read in 2025, right? We ask everyone at NPR - so we got editors and producers and people on the business side and all that stuff. We asked them what their favorite books of the year were. This year, we're in the neighborhood of 380 books, which is a lot. But the size and scope is sort of the whole point.

RASCOE: So what have you got for us?

LIMBONG: All right, well, word on the street, I hear that someone on your staff is looking for something plotty (ph).

RASCOE: OK.

LIMBONG: So one of the books I personally recommended was a Emma Pattee's ""Tilt."" Now, this is a book about a woman. She's super-duper pregnant, and she's at an IKEA running an errand when an earthquake happens. And it's a really speedy book because at its core, it is a very - person has to go from point A to point B, right? She's got to find her way home out of this IKEA in a Portland that has been ravaged by an earthquake, and she runs into a few obstacles here and there, and she sort of has to be on the move. But what it is also is a critique or a pretty funny send-up of the ""Keeping Up With The Joneses"" of parenthood - right? - you know, that feeling where if you don't buy the fanciest schmanciest bajillion-dollar stroller, you are a failure.

RASCOE: Yeah.

LIMBONG: It's sort of poking at that and asking some interesting questions about motherhood and marriage and relationships, all while being straight up an action-adventure book.

Another sort of plotty book is Kashana Cauley's ""The Payback."" This is a bit of a heist novel about a woman and her friends who concoct a bit of a ""Ocean's Eleven"" type caper to wipe out everyone's student loans. This isn't necessarily taking place in our world. It's in a bit of a heightened world where there are these special cops on the hunt for anyone who is late to repay their debts, and they will track you down and kind of assault you if you're late on your repayment. It's a pretty thrilling read.

RASCOE: OK. Well, what about nonfiction?

LIMBONG: Yeah. I know - we're at the time of year where a lot of families are traveling, right? And traveling can be stressful. So a book I've been thinking about is called ""A Marriage At Sea"" by Sophie Elmhirst, right? It's about a young British couple in the '70s who decide they want to sell everything off and sail to New Zealand. Things don't go great (laughter). And they end up floating on a life raft in the Pacific. It's a deeply reported book, but it does also make me think, like, oh, maybe me dragging my partner to the airport and the plane is delayed - things could be worse than having to eat stale McDonald's fries. You know what I mean?

RASCOE: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

LIMBONG: (Laughter) While we're talking about nonfiction, there's also this book called ""Fetishized"" by Kaila Yu. And this is a essay collection about having mixed feelings about being objectified. She was a former model, and so she cops to catering for what we might call the male gaze, but she is also aware of the broader political, cultural baggage that doing that can have. And so I think it's an interesting insight into a weird slice of life.

RASCOE: So what's a book that you recommend personally?

LIMBONG: One of the books I put up for Books We Love was called ""The Rest Of Our Lives"" by Ben Markovits. This was actually one of the finalists for the Booker Prize. It's about a guy whose wife cheated on him a while back, but he swore not to do anything about it until they became empty nesters - right? - until their youngest was off in college. And so the book follows him dropping his daughter off at school and then going on a road trip. He doesn't have a destination in mind. He just is sort of driving to drive and to figure things out.

I was a bit trepidatious about this novel. I thought it would be - people in books discourse have been thinking a lot about men - right? - men in books and men in literature. And I thought it was going to be a very, like - here's the answers about all the problems plaguing men kind of book. But it's actually this really quiet and sweet and intimate book about a guy just trying to find some roots in some of the people he's sort of lost touch with.

RASCOE: That's NPR's Andrew Limbong. Thank you so much, Andrew.

LIMBONG: Thanks, Ayesha.

Now we also get to see how teams perform under a little bit of pressure with the NBA Cup, and here we talk about the teams facing it.

1. Oklahoma City Thunder

(17-1, last week No. 1)

Oklahoma City’s defense hasn’t just been good this season, it’s been suffocating — OKC’s 103 defensive rating is 7 points better than second-place Detroit. Nobody is close to them. While that’s a team effort — they play defense on a string and have a wealth of quality perimeter defenders — Chet Holmgren and his rim protection could be rewarded. He is going to get mentioned in Defensive Player of the Year conversations already, and if Victor Wembanyama can’t reach the 65-game threshold set by the league for awards (a real possibility with him being out with a calf strain), Holmgren becomes the favorite. One other note to scare the rest of the league: Oklahoma City could have two lottery picks next June. They own the Clippers’ first-round pick (the last of the Paul George trade). OKC also owns Utah’s first-rounder, but the Jazz pick is top-eight-protected, so it depends on how much Lauri Markkanen lifts his team up the rest of the way (Utah would currently draft ninth).

2. Detroit Pistons

(14-2, last week No. 3)

Detroit has had one of the best fourth quarter offenses in the NBA this season, averaging 30.3 points per game in the fourth, and has outscored opponents by 2.4 points in the fourth (third best in the league). With that, the Pistons are 11-0 this season when taking a lead into the fourth quarter. Detroit and Jalen Duran were nowhere close to a contract extension last offseason, and to his credit Duran is playing himself into a huge payday — he averages 20.5 points and 11.5 rebounds a game and looks like an All-Star, an All Defensive Team player and might be the Most Improved Player frontrunner. Duran is now critical to the Pistons’ future, and he is going to get paid like it this summer.

3. Denver Nuggets

(12-4, last week No. 2)

Denver’s improved depth is getting put to the test. Starter Christian Braun was already going to miss six weeks with a sprained ankle, and now Aaron Gordon is going to miss 4-6 weeks with a hamstring strain. Sometimes when a starter goes out injured, it’s the bench that suffers, and Denver’s bench was already bottom 10 in the league in scoring, averaging 18.6 points a game before Braun got injured. In the first two games after he went out that bench scored 15 and 9 points, but then it bounced back with two 33-point games against the Pelicans and Rockets, followed by 20 in a loss to the Kings. Peyton Watson has become a key starter now and he has averaged 14.8 points and seven rebounds per game, shooting 58.1% from the floor, when asked to start this season. He has been stepping up. Denver needs a big win vs. San Antonio Friday night to have a chance to advance to the knockout round of the NBA Cup.

4. Houston Rockets

(10-4, last week No. 4)

Kevin Durant is out for the next couple of games for personal reasons, which could put a dent in what has been the best offense in the NBA, but one doing it in a very unconventional way. The Rockets have the league’s lowest 3-point attempt rate — just 33.2% of their shots — but the league’s highest in offensive rebound rate, getting a second chance on 38.5% of their missed shots. They are top 10 in the league in points in the paint per game, 53.3. This team is mashing its way to the best offense in the league, but will that work as well without the outlet of Durant on the court? See for yourself when the Rockets take on the Suns in a fascinating second game on Peacock NBA Monday.

5. Los Angeles Lakers

(12-4, last week No. 7)

LeBron James is back, and what’s maybe most impressive about him is not that this is his 23rd NBA season (a record) or how his mind still just processes the game faster than anyone (as evidenced by his passing), it’s his willingness to accept a new, smaller role. This is Luka Doncic’s team now. Austin Reaves had become a significant presence and key shot creator. LeBron is willingly working to fit in around them. “I can fit in with anybody. I don’t understand why that was even a question,” James said in front of his locker after his debut. LeBron’s Lakers were the winners of the inaugural NBA Cup (then called the In-Season Tournament), and with a win Tuesday over the Clippers, they will clinch a spot in the quarterfinals/knockout round, a game you can watch on Coast 2 Coast Tuesday on NBC and Peacock.

LeBron James made his NBA-record 23rd season debut tonight!

6. Toronto Raptors

(12-5, last week No. 9)

Toronto became the first team to punch its ticket to the quarterfinals (the knockout round) of the NBA Cup, going 3-0 in Cup play so far (they have one Group A Cup game left, against the Pacers, and while it will not impact them getting in it will matter for seeding). The NBA Cup quarterfinals are Dec. 9-10, with the higher-seeded team hosting that game (and the winner advancing to Las Vegas for Semifinals and, potentially, Finals). “I think our guys deserve the opportunity to compete in that setup,” Raptors coach Darko Rajaković said. “It’s gonna be a really different feeling for us because it’s going to be one game that will decide if we’re going to the final four or not. Definitely we have the ambition and desire to be there.”

7. Cleveland Cavaliers

(12-6, last week No. 6)

Donovan Mitchell is comfortable where the Cavaliers are so far this season because he sees the growth and potential with a team that has a top-10 defense and an improving offense. “I think for us, this is perfect,” Mitchell said after Sunday’s win over the Clippers. “There’s so many learning lessons. We have good games, we have bad games. Obviously, you want to continue to trend the right way, and I feel like we are. But I think 12-6 is right where we need to be. Continue to just progress.”

8. Phoenix Suns

(11-6, last week No. 15)

Jordan Ott has impressed in his first season as a head coach, and may even be in line for some Coach of the Year votes if Phoenix keeps playing this well. The first thing that stands out is he just has the Suns playing hard, which is a big step forward for anyone forced to watch this team the past couple of seasons. One of the things Ott has preached is Phoenix winning the possession game, and you saw that Sunday in a comeback win over San Antonio when the Suns took 20 more shots on the night. Can they do that on Peacock NBA Monday in a great early-season showdown against Houston, a game worth streaming to catch?

9. Minnesota Timberwolves

(10-6, last week No. 8)

Minnesota drafted Rob Dillingham No. 8 in 2024, envisioning someone who could step up and be the point guard of the future for them as Mike Conley aged out of the job. Well, Father Time caught up with Conley quickly (6.2 points and 3.5 assists a game this season, he looks slow), and Rob Dillingham has not been ready to step up: 4.7 points and 1.9 assists a game on 38.6% shooting (20% on 3-pointers). It’s too early to write a 20-year-old off, the Timberwolves are going to give Dillingham more time to figure it out. But this is a win-now roster, and it’s no accident that the Wolves come up in talks about potential trades for point guards such as LaMelo Ball, Ja Morant and Trae Young (whether any of those is a fit in Minnesota is another question). Point guard is now a long term concern for Minnesota.

10. Miami Heat

(11-6, last week No. 17)

Winners of four in a row, and now Tyler Herro is set to make his return to the court Monday night against Dallas. It will be interesting to see him fit into the Heat’s new isolation style attacking offense, or whether they run a few more pick-and-rolls for the best P&R ball handler on the roster. If Miami can defeat Milwaukee on Wednesday, it will move to the top of East Group C and have a chance to advance to the quarterfinals of the NBA Cup (the Heat would be 3-1, but the Knicks control their own destiny and would take the group if they win out).

11. San Antonio Spurs

(11-6, last week No. 11)

The Spurs have gone 3-1 without Victor Wembanyama, who is out with a calf strain (and the buzz around the league is he could miss closer to a month, in part because San Antonio will be cautious with his return). The Spurs also have been without Stephon Castle the past three games, forcing Julian Champagnie and Luke Kornet into the starting five. That starting unit has not impressed, but the bench has, which is why the Spurs won their first three games without Wemby (and had a double-digit lead over the Suns but couldn’t hold it).

12. Boston Celtics

(9-8, last week No. 18)

The biggest question coming into the season in Boston was at center, because Kristaps Porzingis, Luke Kornet and Al Horford were all gone. Neemias Queta has answered that question — he has been impressive as the starting five, averaging 9.3 points on 62.8% shooting, and grabbing 7.9 rebounds a game. However, his more significant impact is on the defensive end, where the Celtics are 19.8 points per 100 possessions better when he is on the court.

13. Orlando Magic

(10-8, last week No. 16)

The Magic have gone 3-2 without Paolo Banchero (left groin strain), but with a good +6.4 net rating. The idea that the Magic are better without Banchero is foolish, but it’s fair to question whether there is a ceiling on this offense with him and another natural forward, Franz Wagner, as the primary shot creators. It just doesn’t flow. That said, Orlando has gone 8-4 in its last 12 games (with a +7.1 net rating) after a 1-4 start to the season, thanks in large part to Desmond Bane looking more comfortable and an improved defense.

14. New York Knicks

(9-6, last week No. 5)

This ranking feels a little low for the Knicks, but they have stumbled of late. New York is 1-2 on its current five-game road trip and is now 1-5 for the season away from Madison Square Garden — and that lone win, against Dallas last week, only happened because Brandon Williams got called for hooking Landry Shamet on a drive for a game-tying layup. The Knicks control their own destiny in the NBA Cup, beat Charlotte on the road on Wednesday then Milwaukee at home on Friday and the Knicks advance to the quarterfinals.

15. Atlanta Hawks

(11-7, last week No. 13)

Since Trae Young went out with a sprained knee, the Hawks are 9-4 with a +6.3 net rating, with a slightly above average offense and a top-10 in the league defense. Not only did the wheels not fall off without Young on the court, but this stretch may also have shown a path to a future without him. Atlanta went into this season with a roster specifically built to maximize Young’s strengths, and the front office wanted to see what that roster could do before making any long-term decisions about a new contract for Young (they did not extend him last summer, and he can opt out and become a free agent next summer) or Kristaps Porzingis. What they have learned so far is that this team is not bad without Young. That could play into future decisions.

16. Philadelphia 76ers

(9-7, last week No. 14)

Paul George has been on a minute restriction since his return, averaging 13.3 points in 22 minutes a night, and Philly has a -2.2 net rating with him on the court in that small sample size. Whether George and Joel Embiid are playing or not, this is Tyrese Maxey’s team, he drives the offense and leads the league in touches, averaging five more a night than Nikola Jokic. Behind him, the 76ers have been one of the best fourth quarter teams in the league this season, averaging 30.1 points per game in the fourth (fourth best in the league), they are outscoring opponents by 5.1 in the fourth (best in the league), and with that have a solid 6-5 record in games where they trailed entering the fourth.

17. Chicago Bulls

(9-7, last week No. 19)

On paper, the Bulls had a good week, winning three of four, including beating the Nuggets, and Nikola Vucevic drained a game-winner against the Trail Blazers. However, after the Bulls beat the lowly Wizards 121-120 Sunday, Vucevic was not happy and tried to explain to a young roster why: “For three quarters, we were very soft. We gave no resistance. We didn’t do anything that we talked about. Just played really soft. It was really bad.” Chicago is on the road this week, but with winnable games against New Orleans, Charlotte and Indiana.

18. Golden State Warriors

(9-9, last week No. 10)

Golden State is 4-6 in its last 10 games and, according to Jimmy Butler, the issue is the team’s defense in that stretch. Over those 10 games, the Warriors have a defensive rating of 112.4, 12th in the league. Jimmy Butler summed it up this way: “We’re just not guarding nobody. From what I can tell, I haven’t been here long, but that’s never been the formula here. To win a championship, you got to take each and every matchup personal. Yeah, help’s going to be there, but we got to do way better guarding on that side of the ball.”

19. Milwaukee Bucks

(8-9, last week No. 12)

The Bucks have dropped both games since Giannis Antetokounmpo went out with a groin strain and now have dropped four in a row and 5-of-6, with a -9 net rating in those six games. Milwaukee controls its own destiny in the NBA Cup but will have to beat Miami and New York on the road — without Antetokounmpo — to advance. That’s a big ask.

20. Portland Trail Blazers

(7-10, last week No. 20)

The Trail Blazers surprisingly control their own destiny and can win the NBA Cup West Group C — the “group of death” with five of the top nine teams in the conference — by beating San Antonio on Wednesday night. That will mean turning things around fast, the Trail Blazers are 2-7 in their last nine with a -7.9 net rating in those games.

21. Los Angeles Clippers

(5-12, last week No. 23)

Kawhi Leonard made his return to the court after missing 10 games with an ankle/foot sprain, and scored 20 in a loss to the Cavaliers, shooting 6-of-13 in his 26 minutes. Just his return should help other Clippers because of his gravity. For example, the most underrated player in the league is not so underrated anymore — Ivica Zubac is drawing a lot more defensive attention this season, something coach Tyronn Lue talked about recently: “Just double team the post, not let him get a rhythm on the post. Also just fronting the post a lot, so now we got a flash and trying to hit him over the top. But [teams] doing a good job just trying to keep it out of his hands, and when they can try to push him off the block so he’s not in his sweet spot.” Part of the reason teams are collapsing on Zubac is that without Norman Powell or near enough shot creation and shooting, teams are not penalized for packing the paint and focusing on stopping him. Despite the rough start, the Clippers can go to 3-0 in NBA Cup play and put themselves in the driver’s seat to advance to the knockout round with a win “on the road” against the Lakers this week, a game you can watch on Coast 2 Coast Tuesday on NBC and Peacock.

22. Memphis Grizzlies

(6-11, last week No. 25)

The Grizzlies took advantage of the schedule and snapped a streak where they had lost 9-of-10 and knocked off the Kings and Mavericks in their last two games — doing so without the services of injured-but-still-talking-trash Ja Morant and the just injured Jaren Jackson Jr. It may be tough to keep that streak going against Denver on Monday (and don’t trash talk Jokic, you don’t want him playing angry), the Memphis heads out on the road again for its next four.

23. Utah Jazz

(5-11, last week No. 22)

Lauri Markkanen is averaging 29.3 points per game, but is doing it while barely dribbling the ball — 91% of his shot attempts have come off two dribbles or fewer (compare that to SGA, where more than 45% of his shots come off 7+ dribbles). It’s because the Jazz work hard to free him with off-ball actions, which makes him very difficult to cover. Lakers coach J.J. Redick talked about it before one of their matchups last week. “He’s getting about 31 off-ball screens a game ... I’m not comparing him to Steph Curry, but there’s a similarity to the scout in terms of his your awareness on him. If he’s head under and he’s not trying to duck you in or post you up, he’s going to come off something. He’s going to come off a smash or he’s going to come off a pin down. He’s at the top of the floor, he’s going to get a chest. If he’s in the corner, he’s going to get a single or a double, like you just have to have heightened awareness on him at all times.”

24. Dallas Mavericks

(5-13, last week No. 24)

Dallas has gone 3-10 with Anthony Davis in street clothes, although he could be nearing a return (depending on what the Dallas medical staff is thinking). If Mavericks fans want something to be thankful for through all of this it’s not just Cooper Flagg, but how much better and more comfortable Flagg has looked when played on the wing, his natural spot (the point forward experiment is over).

25. Charlotte Hornets

(4-13, last week No. 21)

The good news is that Brandon Miller is back after missing 13 games with a shoulder injury (and he scored 21 in his return against the Clippers). The other good news in Charlotte to start the season is just how well rookie Kon Knueppel has played. His 18.8 points per game is top among rookies, he’s shooting 42.1% from 3-point range and grabbing 5.8 rebounds a game. It’s early, but Knueppel is right in the middle of the Rookie of the Year discussion with Cooper Flagg and V.J. Edgecombe.

26. Brooklyn Nets

(3-13, last week No. 27)

Brooklyn has the second-worst defense in the league, but one guy who might start to turn things around on that end — and be a key piece for this team long term — is rookie Drake Powell, coach Jordi Fernandez said this week. “He’s very capable of being one of the best perimeter defenders in the league. He’s just a rookie right now, and he doesn’t even know it, but I see the tools. He just has to keep embracing that part and believing that he can do it. And what he’s doing right now is good, but it could be even better. If he has that belief, conviction and work ethic, the sky’s the limit for him defensively.” Egor Demin could be part of the future, too, but he’s got to start getting downhill more: He’s taken 14 shots in the restricted area this season (13.3% of this attempts) and 73 3-point attempts (69.6% of his total shot attempts).

27. Sacramento Kings

(4-13, last week No. 26)

DeMar DeRozan summed up where the Kings are emotionally after losing eight straight, saying they are “In a s**** place. Don’t nobody want to lose the way we’ve been losing… I think it’s just everything right now for us is just s****, honestly. Sometimes when you’re in the deep end, it’s hard to hear anything. You’re just trying to swim your way out, one way or another.” Adding to Sacramento’s pile of, um, manure is the news that Domantas Sabonis will be out at least a month with a torn meniscus. If you’re a Sacramento fan searching for a reason to believe the team can turn things around, there is this: the Kings have played the toughest schedule in the league so far this season. Things will get easier.

28. New Orleans Pelicans

(2-15, last week No. 28)

Zion Williamson returned to the court this week and averaged 18 points and 4.5 rebounds in the two games played. The story in New Orleans has been Derik Queen. He faced some unfair expectations because of the overpay Joe Dumars gave up to get him (control of the Pelcians’ 2026 first-round pick, which looks like it will be a high one in a deep draft), but Queen himself has been impressive. He put up 30 points, nine rebounds, four assists and a couple of blocks going up against three-time MVP Nikola Jokic, for the first time, and after the game earned praise from Jokic: “He’s an amazing player. You can see some similarities [to me]. I don’t want people to see him and tell him he’s something like me. He’s a good enough player to have his own story.”

29. Indiana Pacers

(2-14, last week No. 29)

Pacers fans looking for a bright spot can point to the return of Bennedict Mathurin to the lineup. He has played in just five games this season, but is averaging 26.4 points a night. The Pacers picked up a win last week against lowly Charlotte and have a good shot at another one Friday against the one team below them in these rankings.

30. Washington Wizards

(1-15, last week No. 30)

Washington hasn’t won a game since a week before Halloween. The biggest problem is that the young team — even with a couple of veterans like CJ McCollum and Khris Middleton — can’t close games. Washington averages 24.9 points a game in the fourth quarter, and they get outscored by 7.5 points a game in the fourth, both of which are the worst in the league. Washington is 0-11 when trailing heading into the fourth and 1-4 when they are ahead entering the final frame.

NBC News Think,https://www.nbcnews.com/world/gaza/us-backed-aid-company-gaza-shutters-operations-israels-military-defens-rcna245771,U.S.-backed aid company in Gaza shutters operations as Israel's military and defense minister clash,"JERUSALEM — The U.S.- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, set up to distribute aid to Gaza as an alternative to the United Nations but which Palestinians said endangered the lives of civilians as they tried to get food, said Monday it would shutter operations.

The foundation had already closed distribution sites after a U.S.-brokered ceasefire took effect six weeks ago in Gaza. It announced Monday that it was permanently shutting down, claiming it had fulfilled its mission. “We have succeeded in our mission of showing there’s a better way to deliver aid to Gazans,” GHF director John Acree said in a statement.

The operations of the GHF were shrouded in secrecy during its short time in operation, and the group never revealed its sources of funding and said little about the armed contractors who operated the sites.

It said its goal was to deliver aid to Gaza without it being diverted by Hamas.

Palestinians, aid workers and health officials have said the system forced aid-seekers to risk their lives to reach the sites by passing Israeli troops who secured the locations. Soldiers often opened fire, killing hundreds, according to witnesses and videos posted to social media. The Israeli military says it only fired warning shots as a crowd-control measure or if its troops were in danger.

GHF said there was no violence in the aid sites themselves but acknowledged the potential dangers people faced when traveling to them on foot. However, contractors working at the sites, backed by video accounts, said the American security guards fired live ammunition and stun grenades as hungry Palestinians scrambled for food.

GHF shutters

Acree said that GHF would hand off its work to the U.S.-led center in Israel overseeing the Gaza ceasefire, called the Civil-Military Coordination Center.

“GHF has been in talks with CMCC and international organizations now for weeks about the way forward and it’s clear they will be adopting and expanding the model GHF piloted,” he said.

Tommy Pigott, a deputy spokesperson for the U.S. State Department, said on social platform X that GHF had “shared valuable lessons learned with us and our partners.”

GHF began operating in late May, nearly three months after Israel had halted food deliveries to Gaza, pushing the population toward famine.

Israel intended for the private contractor group to replace the U.N. food distribution system, claiming Hamas was diverting large amounts of aid. The U.N. denied the claims.

The U.N. had opposed the creation of GHF, saying the system gave Israel control over food distribution and could force the displacement of Palestinians. Throughout the war, the U.N. led a massive humanitarian effort with other aid groups, distributing food, medicine, fuel and other supplies at hundreds of centers around Gaza.

In the release, GHF said it had delivered over 3 million food boxes to Gaza, totaling 187 million meals.

Israel’s military chief and defense minister in rare public clash

On Monday, Israel’s defense minister clashed publicly with the military’s chief of staff over the army’s latest probes of its failures in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel by Palestinian militants that sparked the Israel-Hamas war.

Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz had said earlier that he would order a re-examination of the military’s latest internal review into what happened Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251 people to Gaza. He also said he would be freezing new appointments in the army pending the conclusions of this new review. Israel’s government has long resisted the establishment of a state commission of inquiry into the Oct. 7 attack.

In response, military Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir said in a sharply worded statement Monday that the defense minister’s move was “puzzling” and “not substantive.” He said that freezing appointments would harm the military’s “capabilities and its readiness for the upcoming challenges” and claimed he would continue to “hold posting discussions as planned, in accordance with his authority.”

The army “is the only body in the country that has thoroughly investigated its own failures and taken responsibility for them,” wrote Zamir. “If any further examination is required to complete the picture, it must take the form of an external, objective and independent commission” that will also probe “the interface between the military echelon and the political echelon.”

Moments after Zamir put out the statement, Katz doubled down on his decision, releasing a statement saying he “respects” the military chief of staff, “who knows very well that he is subordinate to the prime minister, the defense minister and the government of Israel.” He added he “does not intend to argue in the media” and reasserted his authority to decide on military appointments.

Following the military’s latest review, Zamir sanctioned 13 army officials who were top commanders on Oct. 7, censuring some and forcing others into retirement.

The attack kick-started the war in Gaza, in which over 69,700 Palestinians have been killed and over 170,800 injured, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry.

The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but has said women and children make up a majority of those killed. The ministry, part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals, maintains detailed records viewed as generally reliable by independent experts.

Israel says it kills wanted militant in West Bank

In the occupied West Bank, the Israeli military said it killed a militant wanted in a May 2024 car ramming attack that killed two Israeli soldiers in the northern city of Nablus.

The army said that the suspect, identified as Ala Raouf Shetiyya, was armed and barricaded himself inside a building before he was shot dead.

Israel has launched a military offensive in the West Bank since the Oct. 7 attacks in what it says is a crackdown against Palestinian militants. Tens of thousands of civilians have been displaced, and while many of the dead were militants, Palestinians and rights groups say scores of stone throwers and uninvolved civilians have been killed.",2025-11-25 02:16:03.095000+00:00,literal,Factual reporting on reporting and political figures,literal,literal,0,literal,0.9242129,0.07578713,0.9242129,True

Imagine this on a movie poster: ""'Two thumbs up! — Pope Leo.""

The pope meets movie stars and directors at the Vatican today, including Cate Blanchett, Chris Pine, Spike Lee, Viggo Mortensen, and Monica Bellucci, to ""deepen dialogue with the World of Cinema,"" says the Vatican. Pope Leo also revealed his four favorite movies.

One is 1965's The Sound of Music with Julie Andrews. Great songs, great curtains, ""wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings …"" And nuns who sneak under the hood of the Gestapo's cars to remove critical parts, so the Trapp family can flee Nazi rule in Austria, climbing every mountain as they go.

Another is Frank Capra's 1946 film, It's A Wonderful Life. George Bailey, played by Jimmy Stewart, questions the worth of his life while standing on a snowy bridge. But Clarence, an angel, shows him how so many lives would be poorer without him. ""Strange, isn't it?"" asks Clarence. ""Each man's life touches so many other lives. When he isn't around, he leaves an awful hole, doesn't he?""

The pope also lists 1980's Ordinary People, directed by Robert Redford, about the struggles of a family in which one son has died in an accident, and the surviving son has tried to end his life. A psychiatrist, played by Judd Hirsch, tells him, ""Feelings are scary. And sometimes they're painful. And if you can't feel pain, then you're not going to feel anything else either.""

And finally, Pope Leo cites the 1997 film, Life is Beautiful. Roberto Benigni plays Guido, a Jewish Italian bookshop owner, sent to a concentration camp with his son. Guido dances and mugs to try to convince the little boy it's all a game, hoping to protect him from knowing the savagery that surrounds them. The film was honored and popular, but also criticized for trying to strike laughs from a concentration camp. Benigni, who's father had been in a Nazi labor camp, told The Guardian, ""To laugh and to cry comes from the same point of the soul, no?""

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/25/giridharan-sivaraman-australia-doesnt-need-another-migration-debate-tackle-inequality,Australia doesn’t need another migration ‘debate’. We need leaders brave enough to tackle inequality for all | Giridharan Sivaraman,"Racism and economic insecurity can have a close relationship in this country. That is most apparent when Australia finds itself pulled into another so-called “debate” about migration. This is usually sparked by populism or attempts to blame complex issues like housing affordability on our annual migrant intake.

Across the country, recent rallies and commentary are blaming migrants for a range of woes, from the cost of living to housing supply. Politicians from various sides made similar claims prior to the last federal election. We’re seeing a rise in far-right parties platformed on anti-immigration rhetoric and racism. This rhetoric feeds on genuine economic concerns but ignores the structural forces driving economic insecurity and undermines the right to dignity, security and equality for all.

The Coalition is reported to be working on a new policy to cut migration. There is nothing wrong with discussing migration levels. The issue is when we are not having honest discussions about the rights to housing, decent social security benefits and fair wages. The debate needs to be courageous enough to require the wealthy and corporations to give fairly to help realise those rights and to interrogate a crisis of systemic inequality.

Taking the easy but misleading route of blaming migrants for economic insecurity only serves to stoke the already smouldering fires of racism. Migrants are dehumanised in this debate, and this racism has harmful impacts on their daily lives.

When commentary repeatedly frames migrants as a burden, a threat or the reason for economic hardship, it reinforces stereotypes that have real consequences. It ignores the fact that migration has been a bedrock of our economic success and that migrants on average contribute far more than they receive. Such narratives have historically paved the way for cuts to social security for all, harsher migration policies and a political climate where compassion is treated as weakness. They shape public fear, not public understanding. And when fear grows, racism grows with it. We must ask ourselves: who benefits when communities are set against each other?

3:33 Factchecking protesters' claims of 'mass migration' into Australia – video

For example, when racism is embedded in migration systems through visa uncertainty or inadequate workplace protection, it enables exploitation. Some employers take advantage of the fact that migrant workers may fear deportation or visa cancellation if they speak up. This means they can be paid less, work longer hours, or accept unsafe conditions as a means of survival. But this is not a “migrant problem”. It is a structural problem that affects the entire labour market. Underpayment in one part of the workforce drags wages down across the economy. It creates a false sense of job scarcity. It pits workers against each other while employers benefit. Migrant workers lose. Local workers lose. The only winners are those who profit from division and vulnerability.

If we truly care about lifting living standards, improving wages and building a fairer future for everyone, then we must tackle the root causes of economic insecurity rather than scapegoat those who contribute enormously to our society. One of the ways of doing this is for the federal government to endorse the national anti-racism framework which marks its one year anniversary this week. Strengthening wage protections, ensuring migrant workers can safely report exploitation and enforcing fair work laws – including a ‘positive duty’ where the onus is on employers to protect workers from racial discrimination – all benefit the entire workforce. When workers feel secure, when wages rise, when housing is affordable, when communities are thriving, racism loses its grip, and everyone wins.

We need to focus on the systems that create poverty, instead of stigmatising people for being disadvantaged by them. If we tackle the real and complex problems that cause economic insecurity, we can reduce racism, while making systems fairer for everyone. Migration has always been part of Australia’s story. What matters now is whether we use it as a political tool that drives us apart and obscures the real problems, or whether we choose leadership that brings people together and improves the lives of all.",2025-11-25 00:00:00,irony,"Skeptical quotes around "" claims of """,irony,figurative,1,figurative,0.45646742,0.5435326,0.5435326,True
NBC News Think,https://www.nbcnews.com/sports/nfl/chiefs-super-bowl-hopes-arent-dead-yet-finally-winning-close-game-rcna245495,The Chiefs' Super Bowl hopes aren't dead yet after they finally won a close game,"On their way to a Super Bowl appearance last season, the Kansas City Chiefs could do no wrong in close games, posting an 12-0 record in games decided by one score or less.

Yet the Chiefs entered Week 12 of this season just 5-5 and facing the possibility of having a losing record through 11 games for the first time since 2012 because they were no longer the league's best team in the clutch — 0-5 in one-score games.

That changed, finally, Sunday against Indianapolis. Trailing by as many as 11 points with a minute left in the third quarter, the Chiefs scored the final 14 points to beat the Colts in overtime, 23-20.

The win gives Kansas City (6-5) a 59% chance to make the postseason; a loss would have dropped that likelihood to 31%, according to NFL statistics.

""This is exactly what we needed,"" Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes said. ""Everybody made plays when we needed it.""

The narrow win wouldn't have happened without a defensive turnaround. After having allowed the Colts (8-3) to score four times on their first six drives, the Chiefs held them scoreless on their final four possessions, all four of which ended in three-and-outs and produced just 13 yards combined.

The circumstances suggested the defensive stand was unlikely. Kansas City ranked eighth-best this season in defensive points added and sixth-best in EPA allowed on dropbacks in the fourth quarter and overtime, but Indianapolis posed perhaps its most difficult offensive challenge of the season, having led the NFL in yards per game. Colts running back Jonathan Taylor entered the game leading the NFL in rushing yards, touchdown runs and total touchdowns.

But Taylor finished with a season-low 66 yards from scrimmage. And Indianapolis went nowhere over the fourth quarter and overtime even though it wasn't affected by the issues that had cooled its hot start. Quarterback Daniel Jones committed three turnovers and was sacked nine times in his first eight games, but in his last three games had seven turnovers and 12 sacks. The Chiefs didn't get a single turnover or sack but still held the Colts to 11 points lower than their NFL-leading season average.

Defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo ""had a great plan defensively against one of the best offenses in the National Football League,"" Chiefs coach Andy Reid said.

Kansas City has made the playoffs 10 consecutive seasons, the second-longest streak in NFL history. Continuing it was in jeopardy with four minutes left in the fourth quarter when Kansas City got the ball back backed up only 2 yards from its own end zone.

“Dude, you found a dead body?” the host asks.

“Yes,” the caller replies.

“Dude, call the police!” the host repeatedly urges him.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/24/the-guardian-view-on-un-climate-talks-they-reveal-how-little-time-is-left,The Guardian view on UN climate talks: they reveal how little time is left | Editorial,"This year’s UN climate talks in Brazil’s Belém ended without a major breakthrough. The text of the final agreement lacked a deal to shift away from fossil fuels, delayed crucial finance and the “mutirão” decision contained no roadmap to halt and reverse deforestation. But the multilateral system at Cop30 held together at a point when its collapse felt close. This ought to be a warning: next year’s conference of the parties must strike a better bargain between the rich and poor world.

Developing countries are far from united on some issues. Over rare earth minerals China sees any move as targeting its dominance, while Africa sees it as essential for governance. Elsewhere petrostates did not support Colombia’s call for a fossil fuel phase-out. Yet the global south broadly coheres around a simple principle: its nations must be equipped to survive a climate emergency they did not create. That means cash to build flood defences, make agricultural systems resilient, protect coastlines and rebuild after disasters strike. They also demand front-loaded finance to transition to clean, green economic growth.

But climate finance is a hard sell in the global north. Rightwing populists in the west rail against cash being spent on climate and foreigners. Any issue that fuses the two becomes a difficult political terrain. Then there is the broader geopolitics – one in which spiky confrontations have become the norm. For parts of the rich world, clean industrialisation of the global south isn’t a priority – it’s an economic threat.

Donald Trump did not send a team to Brazil, the first time since 1995 America was not officially represented at the annual climate summit. This may not have been entirely unwelcome. The US, which owes the largest climate debt in the world, has blocked meaningful finance deals for years – and its reshoring agenda is designed to keep key industries at home. This is not entirely without logic: some analysts say China is the proof that the west has reason to fear too rapidly empowering poorer nations.

But such a narrow worldview will only hinder progress. As Evans Njewa, chair of the Least Developed Countries (LDC) group, stated bluntly after Cop30 ended, Belém was missing ambition. For him the world’s most vulnerable countries came seeking protection; they left with promises postponed. Yet the disappointment felt today is a spur for greater action tomorrow. The LDCs are looking to Cop31 in Turkey and, ultimately, to Cop32 in Ethiopia to change minds.

This year’s UN adaptation report could not be clearer: the scale of the task ahead is vast. Developing countries, it suggests, require more than $310bn per year by 2035 – yet they received only $26bn in 2023, down from $28bn the year before. Needs are rising faster than finance. The UN warns that without a dramatic course-correction the poorest countries will be left exposed to heatwaves, wildfires and floods.

The urgency of the crisis explains why African negotiators are so insistent that adaptation finance must be from the state, preferably in grant form. To imagine otherwise, they say, is delusional; currently private finance makes up only 5% of adaptation cash and most of that is philanthropic. Private capital will not build sea walls, restore mangroves or protect subsistence farmers. Cop30 underscored a simple reality: only by moving beyond symbolism and self-interest can the world secure its future.",2025-11-24 00:00:00,literal,Factual reporting on reporting and legal matters,literal,literal,0,literal,0.97540164,0.024598405,0.97540164,True

Top United States officials are holding talks with Ukrainian and European diplomats in Geneva to discuss US President Donald Trump’s peace plan aimed at ending the nearly four-year-old war between Russia and Ukraine.

But the so-called 28-point plan pushed by the Trump administration has alarmed Ukraine and its European allies, who see it as a capitulation to Russian demands, particularly territorial concessions and limits on the size of Ukraine’s military.

Trump had set a November 27 deadline for Ukraine to accept his peace plan, but after pushback from European leaders, Washington appears to have softened its stance, with Trump saying the plan did not represent a “final offer” for Ukraine.

This will likely create some wriggle room for diplomacy at the high-stakes talks in Geneva, Switzerland.

So, why are Ukraine’s European allies opposed to the draft plan? Who’s participating? What’s on the agenda in Geneva? And does the plan favour Moscow?

What’s on the agenda at the US-Ukraine talks in Geneva?

The talks are an attempt to reconcile the contentious draft peace plan, as Kyiv and its European allies want Kyiv’s long-term security interests protected.

Representatives from Ukraine, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and the European Union will join top US officials, including US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, to discuss how to end the war – Europe’s deadliest since World War II. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said there will also be a Russian presence.

The talks, Al Jazeera’s Hashem Ahelbarra said, “could be the most decisive moment for Ukraine”.

“There is a great deal of anxiety among Ukrainians and Europeans about the nature of the 28-plan drafted by the Americans,” said Ahelbarra, reporting from Geneva.

“The concerns are about the territorial concessions: We’re talking about Luhansk, Donetsk and Crimea, which the Ukrainians, as per the plan, have to give up in exchange for the potential of a permanent deal with Russia. They have to freeze the front lines, particularly in Kherson and Zaporizhia.

“The third element is the reduction of the capacity of the Ukrainian armed forces from 900,000 soldiers to 600,000, and this is widely perceived by the Ukrainians as a major concession they cannot afford to make,” Ahelbarra said.

In a post on X on Sunday, Zelenskyy said he hopes “there will be a result”.

“The bloodshed must be stopped, and we must ensure that the war is never reignited,” the Ukrainian leader said. “I am awaiting the results of today’s talks and hope that all participants will be constructive. We all need a positive outcome.”

Who is participating in the talks?

The US’s Rubio and Witkoff are leading the Geneva talks, which will also include US Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll.

Nine Ukrainian officials are attending the talks, including Ukraine’s presidential office chief Andriy Yermak and top envoy Rustem Umerov, who have been empowered to deal directly with Russia by the president.

National security advisers from the E3 alliance of France, Britain and Germany will also join the discussions, alongside other officials from the EU, including Italy.

Why are European leaders raising concerns about Trump’s peace plan?

Ukraine’s European allies say the current peace plan does not address Ukraine’s security concerns. They say Russia cannot be rewarded with territory for invading Ukraine.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Sunday that “any credible and sustainable peace plan should first and foremost stop the killing and end the war, while not sowing the seeds for a future conflict”.

She spelled out three elements required for a just and lasting peace, stating that borders should not be changed by force, that there should not be a cap on Ukraine’s military, and that the EU should be central to securing peace for Ukraine.

“Ukraine must have the freedom and sovereign right to choose its own destiny. They have chosen a European destiny,” von der Leyen said.

On the sidelines of the Group of 20 (G20) summit in Johannesburg, South Africa on Saturday, European and other Western leaders pushed back against Trump’s plan, saying it required “additional work”.

“We are ready to engage in order to ensure that a future peace is sustainable. We are clear on the principle that borders must not be changed by force,” said a joint statement signed by the UK, Canada, Finland, France, Spain, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Germany, Norway and the Republic of Ireland.

The statement noted that the allies were “concerned by the proposed limitations on Ukraine’s armed forces, which would leave Ukraine vulnerable to future attack”, adding that any decisions regarding NATO and the EU would require the consent of member states.

Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 and has since captured large parts of the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk region. Moscow had annexed the Crimean Peninsula in 2014.

According to Trump’s draft plan, Crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk will be recognised as de facto Russian territory. Ukrainian forces will be required to withdraw from parts of Donetsk that they currently control, while Kherson and Zaporizhia will be frozen along the line of contact.

The proposed plan would also see Ukraine cut its army and renounce its ambitions to join NATO, which has been a major sticking point in the earlier proposals. The size of the Ukrainian armed forces will be limited to 600,000 personnel.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said that he spoke with Trump in a long phone call on Friday and conveyed that Europe needed to be a part of any peace process.

“An end to the war can only be achieved with the unconditional consent of Ukraine,” Merz said during the G20 summit briefing. “But we are still quite a way from a good outcome for everyone.”

Von der Leyen noted that a key principle for Kyiv’s European allies was “nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine”.

Speaking with reporters ahead of the G20 summit, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said, “Time and again, Russia pretends to be serious about peace, but their actions never live up to their words.”

French President Emmanuel Macron said on Saturday that Russia would “betray” its promise and “come back” if there are no elements of deterrence and if Ukraine were to cut its army size and follow Trump’s plan.

In a post on X, Macron welcomed US efforts to bring peace, but said that the current proposal “must be strengthened” and “Ukraine must never be left vulnerable”.

Macron wrote, “Everyone wants peace – except Russia, which continues to stubbornly bomb Ukraine”, adding that support for Ukraine was “decisive”.

EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said: “Russia has no legal right whatsoever to any concessions from the country it invaded.”

But US Vice President JD Vance has rebuked criticism of the peace plan.

“There is a fantasy that if we just give more money, more weapons, or more sanctions, victory is at hand,” the vice president posted on X on Saturday. “Peace won’t be made by failed diplomats or politicians living in a fantasy land. It might be made by smart people living in the real world.”

What has Ukraine’s Zelenskyy said about the plan?

Zelenskyy said that Ukraine was trying to defend its sovereignty while retaining the support of its most important ally, the United States. Trump had said Zelenskyy can “fight his little heart out” if he rejected the proposal.

“Now is one of the most difficult moments of our history. Now, the pressure on Ukraine is one of the heaviest. Now, Ukraine can face a very difficult choice — either losing dignity or risk losing a major partner,” Zelenskky said.

In a 10-minute speech outside the presidential palace, Zelenskyy said that if his country follows through on the proposed plan, it would leave Kyiv “without freedom, dignity and justice”.

Accepting the plan, which has been widely viewed as favouring Moscow, would also mean believing “someone who has already attacked us twice”, said Zelenskyy.

“I will present arguments, I will persuade, I will propose alternatives,” said the Ukrainian president. He then referred to the Russian invasion in February 2022, saying: “We did not betray Ukraine then, we will not do so now.”

On Sunday, Zelenskyy said that Ukraine’s focus at the talks is “on working as constructively as possible on the steps proposed by the United States”.

“We are working to ensure that the path toward ending the war is real and that the principled elements are put into action,” he said after a call with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.

Does Trump’s peace plan favour Moscow?

European leaders are concerned that Trump’s proposal heavily favours Russia, which has been seeking to control all of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Moscow currently holds parts of that territory, though it has been slowly gaining more ground on the battlefronts.

A group of US senators said on Saturday that they were told by Rubio, who is also Trump’s national security adviser, that the widely leaked draft peace plan did not reflect the US position, but was a Russian “wish list”.

“It looked more like it was written in Russian to begin with,” Senator Mike Rounds, a Republican from South Dakota, said at a security conference in Canada.

However, Rubio denied the assertions, insisting that the plan was “authored by the US” and it was “based on input” from both Russia and Ukraine.

Rounds said he had been assured that the plan was presented to Witkoff, Trump’s overseas envoy, by “someone … representing Russia”. The senator continued: “It is not our recommendation. It is not our peace plan.”

Later, a US Department of State spokesperson said Rounds’s account of his conversation with Rubio was “blatantly false”.

Russian President Vladimir Putin, meanwhile, said Washington’s 28-point plan could “lay the foundation for a final peace settlement”.

Putin also threatened to seize more territory if Ukraine does not accept the proposal, warning that the reported capture of the Ukrainian city of Kupiansk “will inevitably be repeated in other key areas of the front line”.

Speaking from Kyiv, journalist Audrey MacAlpine said Russia has been making battlefield gains in regions of Ukraine where the peace proposal would hand it territory along the line of contact.

She told Al Jazeera that Moscow had carried out overnight attacks on Kherson and Zaporizhia, two regions where Russia would gain de facto control under the 28-point plan being discussed in Geneva.

“No doubt Russia is trying to make gains in these particular regions, and they’ve been successful,” she said. “They’ve been making slow but concerted gains.”

Is Trump likely to seal the peace deal this time?

We do not know yet.

During his presidential campaign leading up to the 2024 US election, Trump claimed that he could end Russia’s war on Ukraine within a day. But a deal proved elusive despite Washington’s diplomatic push.

Since returning to power for a second term in January, Trump has made resolving foreign conflicts central to US foreign policy. He claimed to have helped end several wars, including Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza, the India-Pakistan war, and the Thailand-Cambodia war, among others. Trump even asked for a Nobel Peace Prize for stopping wars.

But he has struggled to end the Russia-Ukraine conflict, despite holding a summit with Putin in Alaska in August.

Trump’s first meeting with Zelenskyy ended in acrimony back in February. The US president made up with the Ukrainian leader, hosting him twice at the White House since the February White House meeting. But his attempt to organise a meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy has not materialised.

In August, Trump warned Russia of severe consequences if Putin refused to end the war. He even announced sanctions on Moscow to force it to end the war. He also slapped hefty tariffs on India for buying Russian oil, which he said was financing Moscow’s war efforts.

As the talks were under way in Geneva on Sunday, Trump again took aim at Ukraine, saying Kyiv has not been grateful for American efforts related to the war with Russia.

“UKRAINE ‘LEADERSHIP’ HAS EXPRESSED ZERO GRATITUDE FOR OUR EFFORTS, AND EUROPE CONTINUES TO BUY OIL FROM RUSSIA. THE USA CONTINUES TO SELL MASSIVE $AMOUNTS OF WEAPONS TO NATO, FOR DISTRIBUTION TO UKRAINE,” Trump said in a Truth Social post on X, echoing remarks he made during a heated exchange in the White House in February in which Trump and US Vice President JD Vance berated Zelenskyy.",2025-11-23 00:00:00,literal,Factual reporting on reporting and policy,literal,literal,0,literal,0.9004606,0.09953946,0.9004606,True

The East Wing of the White House has been demolished to make way for a huge ballroom that will host state dinners for up to a thousand people. But what to do until then?

I have never been to a state dinner. I have milled outside a few with other reporters to shout questions at some of the politicians and celebrities going in and out. Sometimes, they smile.

The menus of what's served are made public. They sound like first-rate fare, without being too daring: heirloom tomato soup, Iowa rib-eye steak, or Maine lobster, followed by maple pecan or orange chiffon cake. But as a couple of state dinner guests have told me — off the record, and with respect for the talented White House kitchen crew, you don't go to a state dinner for the food.

So in the pause while the rubble that was once the East Wing is cleared away, why not move state dinners to a different location? Why not hold them at the Iowa State Fairgrounds?

Yes, it would involve a flight. But if you use last summer's bill of fare as a guide, guests could walk from stand to stand, instead of being stuck in their seats for speeches. They could feast on a Chicken Pickle Ranch Rocket on a Stick, Flamin' Hot Cheetos Fries, a Full Mozzarella Korean Corn Dog, Maple Bacon-Flavored Cheese Curds, or Fairgrounds Fiesta Wontons, filled with egg salad and the size of catcher's mitts, deep-fried and then drizzled with hot honey and pico de gallo.

Now that's America!

For dessert: the Scotcheroo Shake — peanut butter and butterscotch ice cream swirled with Scotcheroo fudge, which is a mix of peanut butter, butterscotch, Rice Krispies and chocolate chips, crowned with whipped cream with caramel and chocolate drizzles.

You can imagine diplomats and politicians staggering into their limos after a fairgrounds state dinner, saying between belches, ""We must end these tariffs and open a Scotcheroo Shake Trade Route!""

And when it comes time for the toasts, heads of state can salute a long, fruitful friendship between countries with the bracing combination of pink lemonade and pickle juice known as a ""Pickled Pink.""

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/24/parent-whatsapp-groups-hell,"Sure, people tell you about sleepless nights. But why does no one mention the hell that is a parent WhatsApp group? | Sean Szeps","When I was little, I thought hell was a fiery pit beneath the Earth’s surface. The image was vivid: flames, tortured souls and a cartoonish devil with a pitchfork.

Now that I’m an adult, I know better. Hell is actually a parent WhatsApp group.

The parent WhatsApp group – known colloquially as Satan’s Slack channel – is one of those parenting surprises no one warns you about. People tell you about the sleepless nights, the lost identity and the toys that reproduce overnight. But no one says: “You’ll one day discuss nits with 30 adults as though global peace depends on it.”

What began as a simple way to share school updates has mutated into a relentless stream of chatter. There are simply too many messages. You wake up to messages, you go to sleep to messages, you duck into a meeting and come back to 64 unread notes about sunscreen. Linda has posted the same information seven times because she doesn’t trust anyone to read it. Which, to be fair, is accurate.

When I was growing up my parents got information the old-fashioned way: crumpled notes in backpacks and gossip at pickup. They weren’t part of a digital micro-community of helicopter-adjacent strangers debating uniform policy. They didn’t refresh their phones at 9.38pm to discover that it’s going to be Harmony Day and every child needs to wear “something representing their heritage”.

My parents didn’t live in constant communication with other parents. They weren’t expected to be this connected, worrying about real-time reminders. And maybe, I’m going out on a limb here, that distance was healthy.

I don’t say this lightly … I think WhatsApp is ruining parenting.

I don’t think it’s evil, per se. In fact, it’s one of my favourite apps for keeping in touch with friends abroad. But the problem is: it’s always on. School parenting used to happen at drop-off, pickup and during homework battles at the dinner table. Now it happens first thing in the morning in bed, 11 minutes later in the bathroom and while sprinting through Kmart before school to find a T-shirt that screams “my child is Cuban-Italian”.

There’s no off switch. Go offline for an hour and suddenly everyone else knows that swimming starts this week, not next, that the assembly has been moved (again), and that Sharon’s selling year 1 tea towels for charity and you were supposed to submit your child’s portrait last Tuesday.

These groups are built for people who are permanently available and find deep meaning in the phrase “quick reminder”. They are not built for me. Or anyone with boundaries. Or a child.

Here’s the hypocrisy of it all: we limit our kids’ screen time, tell them to be present and post quotes about how “childhood is a short season” to our 600 Instagram followers. Then we feel pressured to check our WhatsApp 16 times a day, watching the theatre of parenting confusion unfold in real time.

And it is theatre. The WhatsApp group act is part coordination, part performance. Every “thanks for the reminder” is less about gratitude and more about signalling: “I’m a good parent too, I swear.” Even if I forgot the bake sale once. Or twice. Fine, three times.

I’m worried it’s making us all a bit dumber. Because if the information lives in the group, we stop paying real attention. We rely on the collective brain, on someone else (probably Linda) to notice, remind and repost. It’s the parenting equivalent of a get-out-of-jail-free card. Maybe things would be simpler if our only option was talking to people in public.

The worst part? I’ve become complicit. I can’t quit. Somewhere along the way, I volunteered to be the WhatsApp rep for my daughter’s class. I haven’t slept properly since.

I used to worry about my heart health. Now I worry I’ll die suddenly and come back as the eternal moderator of every year 2 WhatsApp group, trapped forever between reminding people about permission slips and guilt-tripping them about class fundraisers.

All I want is a note in the backpack or a quick chat at pickup. I’m craving an actual conversation with a teacher instead of ignoring her because I’ve already checked WhatsApp four times between leaving my car and getting to the gate.

I want a little space back. A crack in the digital noise. I miss the quiet confidence of not knowing everything all the time. The small mystery of what happens to my kids between drop-off and pickup. The trust that things will be fine, even if I’m not across every single message.

Maybe that’s the real lesson of modern parenting? Not to be more connected but to remember that it’s OK to step back. That missing something isn’t failing. It’s freedom.",2025-11-24 00:00:00,literal,Straightforward news about policy,literal,literal,0,literal,0.65774196,0.342258,0.65774196,True
Al Jazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/24/pentagon-says-it-is-investigating-us-senator-over-illegal-orders-video,Pentagon says it is investigating US senator over ‘illegal orders’ video,"Pentagon suggests Mark Kelly, a former US Navy captain, could be court-martialled for urging military to defy unlawful orders.

The Pentagon has said it is investigating United States Senator Mark Kelly, a retired naval aviator and astronaut, for his participation in a video that urged military service members to refuse “illegal orders”.

It is unusual for the US military to take action against a retired officer. But Monday’s announcement came after President Donald Trump repeatedly called for criminal charges against Kelly and other Democratic lawmakers involved in the video.

Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth said later on Monday that Kelly is facing a probe because he is the only lawmaker in the video who falls under the jurisdiction of military law as a retired Navy captain.

“As was announced, the Department is reviewing his statements and actions, which were addressed directly to all troops while explicitly using his rank and service affiliation – lending the appearance of authority to his words,” Hegseth wrote on X.

“Kelly’s conduct brings discredit upon the armed forces and will be addressed appropriately.”

The senator was quick to respond with defiance to the Pentagon’s move.

“If this is meant to intimidate me and other members of Congress from doing our jobs and holding this administration accountable, it won’t work,” Kelly said in a statement. “I’ve given too much to this country to be silenced by bullies who care more about their own power than protecting the Constitution.”

The Pentagon had suggested that Kelly is accused of “actions intended to interfere with the loyalty, morale, or good order and discipline of the armed forces”.

Last week, Trump described the legislators as traitors and went as far as arguing that they should face the death penalty for sedition: in other words, speech that is designed to incite a rebellion.

Kelly, a former US Navy captain who now represents Arizona in the Senate, was one of six former military and intelligence officers featured in the video, released on November 18.

“Our laws are clear. You can refuse illegal orders,” they said in the video.

The Pentagon stressed that under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) — which spells out military laws and guidelines — service members have a legal obligation to “obey lawful orders and that orders are presumed to be lawful”.

“A servicemember’s personal philosophy does not justify or excuse the disobedience of an otherwise lawful order,” it wrote in Monday’s statement.

The Pentagon added that Kelly could face recall “to active duty for court-martial proceedings or administrative measures”.

Retired military personnel who continue to receive benefits after their service remain subject to military law, according to the UCMJ.

But it is rare for military courts to prosecute former service members, especially for alleged offences committed after their tenure.

In recent days, Democrats have expressed outrage over Trump’s response to the lawmakers’ videos, which they say amounts to a death threat.

Democrats have also argued that the video simply reaffirms a fact of military law: Service members are required to refuse orders they know to be in violation of the US law, as part of their oath to the Constitution.

The controversy came as the US continues to reel from political violence after the assassination of right-wing commentator Charlie Kirk in September and the killing of Democratic Minnesota state lawmaker Melissa Hortman in June.

Trump first invoked the death penalty on Thursday, sparking a firestorm of criticism. “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!” Trump wrote on social media.

Despite the outrage, Trump doubled down on his stance late on Saturday, saying in a social media post that the legislators who released the video “SHOULD BE IN JAIL RIGHT NOW”.

The Pentagon’s move on Monday signals that federal agencies, led by Trump appointees, are willing to respond to the president’s political grievances.

The Department of Justice pursued criminal charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James and former FBI Director James Comey in now-dismissed cases that critics say were political.

Comey was charged with lying to Congress, while James was facing mortgage fraud accusations.

Later on Monday, the White House expressed support for the Pentagon’s investigation of Kelly. “You can’t have a functioning military if there is disorder and chaos within the ranks. And that’s what these Democrat members were encouraging,” Trump’s press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters.",2025-11-24 00:00:00,metaphor,Firestorm used as metaphor for intense controversy,metaphor,figurative,1,literal,0.7443529,0.25564718,0.7443529,False
Al Jazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/11/21/mamdanis-democratic-socialism-is-a-promise-of-true-freedom-for-all,Mamdani’s democratic socialism is a promise of true freedom for all,"In an astonishing victory, 34-year-old state legislator Zohran Mamdani won New York City’s mayoral election. Defeating former state Governor Andrew Cuomo, who enjoyed strong backing from US President Donald Trump and the political establishment, Mamdani became the city’s first Muslim immigrant mayor and its youngest in more than a century. The democratic socialist’s victory sent shock waves through national politics, emboldening progressives across the country to run and to win on agendas as unapologetically ambitious as the moment demands.

Campaigning across the city, Mamdani reached out to various social groups, including African Americans, Muslims, Jews, Hindus, East Africans and South Asians, and especially the youth, many of whom had grown politically disengaged after the Democratic Party’s demoralising performance in recent years. He brought people back into the political process, mobilising voters who otherwise might have stayed home.

Running on a platform calling for a more equitable distribution of wealth through higher taxes on the super-wealthy, a more affordable and accessible housing market, a free and faster public bus system, and universal, no-cost childcare for children from six weeks to five years old, Mamdani has brought into the mainstream a political discourse centred on equity, one the nation has arguably not witnessed since Eugene V Debs, the early 20th-century socialist organiser and five-time presidential candidate who championed workers’ rights and economic justice.

When asked live on television what “democratic socialist” means, Mamdani replied: “When we talk about my politics, I call myself a democratic socialist in many ways inspired by the words of Dr [Martin Luther] King [Jr] from decades ago who said, ‘Call it democracy, or call it democratic socialism. There has to be a better distribution of wealth for all of God’s children in this country.’”

But what, really, is “democratic socialism”? To many, the term “socialism” evokes the economic system of the former Soviet Union, characterised by inefficient allocation of resources, state control and ownership of productive assets, and political repression under a brutally totalitarian regime. Yet that is not what socialism means.

As the late Erik Olin Wright, one of the most influential sociologists of the past half-century and a pioneering scholar of class analysis in capitalism, detailed, what was practised by the Soviet Union was not socialism but “statism”, an economic system in which state incumbents control investment and production through a centralised planning apparatus. Indeed, in common parlance, most people use the term “socialism” to describe what is most accurately referred to as statism.

Over the past century, struggles for more equal alternatives to capitalism have been waged under the banner of “socialism”. Yet the term itself has long been contested, its precise meaning the subject of intense debate both within and without the academic and policy circles.

If nothing else, Karl Marx himself saw socialism as grounded in two essential principles. First, it required the democratisation of not only political life, which refers to the procedural democracy exercised in most developed countries, but also economic life, so that ordinary workers have a voice in how economic resources are distributed. Second, socialism envisioned a reduction in working hours, so that people could cultivate their creative capacities outside the workplace. Indeed, Marx’s critique of capitalism stemmed largely from his belief that it curtails “human flourishing and self-actualisation”.

Yet the socialist experiments of the 19th and 20th centuries across the world bore no resemblance to these humanistic ideals. Socialism, once seen as an economic system that would extend democracy into realms capitalism would never allow, turned into a centralised, grossly inefficient, and authoritarian state apparatus of command and control of both the economy and society. Soviet-style dictatorships rife with corruption and venality turned socialism into a vehicle for state domination rather than human liberation. With shortages, rationing, and long lines in stores, socialism came to be seen by the 1980s as a failed project of social transformation in the places where it was implemented.

So, what is “democratic socialism”?

The term is composed of two words: “democratic” and “socialism”. Democracy is fundamentally a socialist principle. Indeed, democracy is the most effective political mechanism we know for ensuring that the state serves as an agent of the people. If “democracy” is the term to signify the subordination of state power to people’s power, “socialism” is the term to signify the subordination of economic power to people’s power. In democratic socialism, control over investment and production is organised through genuinely democratic means. The central moral objective of democratic socialism is that a national economy should be organised in such a way as to serve the needs and aspirations of ordinary people, not those of elites.

Democratic socialism thus represents an attempt to reconcile the egalitarian goals of socialism with the institutions of liberal democracy. It envisions an economy where markets still allocate resources, but the ownership of productive assets and the distribution of wealth are subject to participatory and democratic decision-making. The goal is not to abolish markets, but to make them answer to the public, to ensure that economic outcomes reflect shared values rather than private power.

It is now well understood that capitalism grants prosperity to some while consigning many others to poverty. It denies the conditions for genuine human flourishing and development from vast segments of the world’s population, even within the most advanced economies. “Freedom of choice,” often celebrated by capitalism’s defenders as its central moral virtue, is in fact only partial. The stark inequalities of income, wealth, and opportunity that capitalism produces narrow what might be called “real freedom”: the genuine ability of people to pursue their life plans and act on the choices that truly matter to them.

The promise of democratic socialism is not simply greater equality, but greater freedom. Its goal is to give all people the ability to truly shape their own lives. That’s what Zohran Mamdani’s platform represents. His policies, such as a rent freeze, fare-free buses and universal childcare, are not merely economic measures; they are instruments of real freedom for ordinary people. When most of one’s paycheque disappears into rent, freedom is constrained. Housing stability helps people feel secure, make long-term plans, and avoid the stress of potential eviction. Housing stability is tied to human dignity. Fare-free public transit extends the freedom of mobility across the city. Free buses make mobility a right, not a privilege, and open up the physical and social space of freedom itself. And universal childcare liberates parents, especially women, from an impossible trade-off between childcare and participation in society. When the burden of childcare is shared by society, everyone gains the freedom to work, study, and engage in public life on equal terms. These policies redefine freedom not as the privilege of the few to accumulate without limit, but as the shared capacity of all to live with security, opportunity, and power over their own lives. That is the freedom democracy promises, and the one democratic socialism delivers.

Among capitalist countries today, the social democracies of the Nordic countries (Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Finland) come closest to the ideals of democratic socialism. A much stronger working class, and its insistence on a firm commitment to social welfare over the narrow interests of elites, has long distinguished these nations from other varieties of capitalism. Yet in social democracies, wealth inequality remains strikingly high, despite a more even distribution of income compared to the other parts of the developed world.

Mamdani’s election as mayor of New York City is a glimmer of hope that democratic processes can still serve the many rather than the few. His equity-centred platform, once dismissed as naive, won the confidence of a diverse majority yearning for justice and dignity. That victory, achieved in the face of relentless racism and Islamophobia, marks a collective triumph.

Yet elections are only beginnings. The hard work now lies ahead: translating promises into policy and hope into tangible change for a more humane and equal distribution of economic resources. The people have spoken; now it is time to deliver.

Such was the extent of fan involvement in the How I’m Feeling Now album that the title of Claws was decided by online vote. The opposite of the album’s more fraught depictions of lockdown, it celebrates being trapped with someone you love, although the clanking rhythm track adds a vague sense of unease.

19. Taxi (2016)

According to one fan database, there are 260 unreleased Charli xcx tracks lurking around online. Taxi, from the scrapped album XCX World, remains the most celebrated for a reason: the funny, snotty saga of a midweek blind date gone wildly out of control, it’s a perfect example of Charli and producer Sophie’s skewed approach to pop.

18. Apple (2024)

The poppiest track on Brat – nearly binned midway through recording sessions – Apple’s earworm bubblegum melody carries a lyric about strained parental relationships and intergenerational trauma. It also went on to both spawn a viral TikTok dance craze and earn a Grammy nomination. The remix, featuring the Japanese House, feels sweeter still – and equally fantastic.

17. New Shapes (ft Caroline Polachek and Christine and the Queens) (2021)

It’s easy to view Brat’s predecessor, Crash, as Charli xcx trying to fit in with standard ideas about mainstream pop, rather than forging her own distinctive path. But its highlights are pretty high: New Shapes deploys both Christine and the Queens and Caroline Polachek over a fierce take on 80s electro.

16. Roll With Me (2017)

View image in fullscreen Sophie (left) and Charli xcx on stage in 2016. Photograph: Daniel Boczarski/Redferns

There used to be a rule of thumb that Charli xcx perversely released her best tracks not on her albums but her mixtapes. Listening to Roll With Me, you can see how that idea blossomed: producer Sophie provides relentless kick-drum thwack and sparse, super-spiky electronics, while Charli brings fabulous attitude-laden pop smarts.

15. Nuclear Seasons (2011)

If you’re looking for early evidence that Charli xcx was different, then this track from her debut EP, later to become the opener for her debut album, is a good place to start. The lyrics mix up relationship trauma, post-apocalyptic imagery and the suggestion that pop culture is a state of decay; the music reboots doomy 80s synth pop. It’s also insanely catchy.

14. 360 (2024)

“I went my own way and I made it / I’m your favourite reference, baby … I don’t fucking care what you think”: 360 is both the sound of the Brat era swaggering (or perhaps staggering) into view and a superb pop song, whether you opt for the original or the Robyn and Yung Lean-assisted remix.

13. I Got It (2017)

The Pop 2 mixtape sounded like Charli xcx and her collaborators trying to will a more interesting, provocative pop landscape into being: on I Got It, extravagantly foul-mouthed rapper Cupcakke, Brazilian drag queen vocalist Pabllo Vittar and pansexual shape-shifting US singer Brooke Candy do their thing over a minimal, thrillingly futuristic musical backdrop.

12. House (2025)

However you might have expected Charli xcx to follow up Brat, it’s unlikely that you expected this, from the forthcoming soundtrack to Wuthering Heights: a warped electronic homage to the Velvet Underground, filled with drones, shards of noise and a guest appearance from John Cale, which bursts into furious distortion-laden industrial noise at its climax.

11. Club Classics (2024)

Pop has hardly wanted for songs about nightclubs, but few of them have captured the small hours dancefloor’s manic sense of euphoria like Club Classics. It feels chaotic, relentless and artificially accelerated, and celebrates complete abandon: “Sweat marks on all my clothes … I wanna be blinded by the lights.”

10. Gone (ft Christine and the Queens) (2019)

View image in fullscreen Christine and the Queens (left) and Charli xcx performing on The Tonight Show in 2019. Photograph: NBC/NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal/Getty Images

Another Christine and the Queens collaboration, Gone improbably transforms the lyrical topic of crushing social anxiety – “I feel so unstable / I fucking hate these people” – into anthemic pop. There’s a powerful sense of catharsis about the way it explodes from brooding verses into a banging, exhilarating chorus.

9. Backseat (ft Carly Rae Jepsen) (2017)

Charli xcx and Carly Rae Jepsen once drunkenly plotted to make an album together; their solitary IRL collaboration is marvellous. Thematically, Backseat feels like two different songs – one about a breakup, the other about the alienating nature of celebrity – perfectly joined by the chorus (“I’m alone”) and shifting, inventive electronic backing.

8. Boys (2017)

By latter-day xcx standards, Boys is musically and lyrically straightforward – a giddy reverie of lust set to a suitably daydreamy backing – but it’s utterly charming and joyful. Extra points for the video, which featured the lead singer of Vampire Weekend lurking among its parade of heavily muscled objects of desire.

7. Anthems (2020)

Written and recorded as Covid raged, its lyrics crowdsourced with fans online, Anthems perfectly captures those lockdown moments when the urge to, as Charli put it, “go out, blow off some steam, get fucked up” became overwhelming. If its sound is intense to the point of seeming a bit nuts, well, that’s how it felt.

6. Boom Clap (2014)

Originally intended for former Disney star Hilary Duff (she rejected it), the song’s author turned Boom Clap into the highlight of her second album, Sucker, and her first US Top 10 hit. No wonder: it’s hugely catchy and impressively classy, the hooky chorus set amid chugging, pulsing synths – though she hates it now.

5. Next Level Charli (2019)

A paean to her fans, packed with references to her past work, the brilliance of Next Level Charli lies in the gulf between the music, which lulls the listener into believing they’re going to get a dreamy, 80s-influenced ballad, and the gobby, playground-chant stridency of the vocal: “In the rave – go for ever and ever!”

4. Von Dutch (2024)

View image in fullscreen In Los Angeles, California, 2024. Photograph: Étienne Laurent/AFP/Getty Images

You could call Von Dutch a diss track – it’s rumoured to be aimed at FKA twigs – but it feels more like an infectious expression of self-confidence: someone who knows she has hit her imperial phase, and has created an irresistible, epochal pop single almost entirely out of grinding, revving noise to prove it.

3. Vroom Vroom (2015)

A step into the leftfield that got decidedly mixed reviews on release, Vroom Vroom now feels like the birth of Charli xcx 2.0, harnessing her songwriting skills to the skeletal, avant-pop sound of PC Music affiliate Sophie. A decade ago it felt completely removed from mainstream pop trends; today it sounds incredibly prescient.

2. Girl, So Confusing (2024)

A different class to the usual pop-star-writes-prickly-song-about-fellow-pop-star fare, Girl, So Confusing is both an amazing song and a heartwarming saga. The original version depicted a fraught relationship with Lorde, accompanied by a synthesiser that fizzes and growls; the remix featured Lorde herself answering the criticisms and movingly explaining her own issues.

1. Track 10 (2017)

On the face of it, Track 10, from her mixtape Pop 2, is an unlikely list-topper. It’s a remix of a demo – eventually reworked into the Lizzo-featuring 2019 single Blame It on Your Love – with what looks like a placeholder title. But it’s also a masterpiece: an epic ballad that’s both wildly experimental and genuinely affecting. The lyrics sound like a drunken confession from someone who can’t stop her insecurities destroying a relationship. Anyone else might have been inclined to play a song like that straight, but somehow, the overload of theoretically alienating electronics – glitches and distortion, wilfully excessive AutoTune, icy maximalist rave synths – only amplifies its impact.",2025-11-20 00:00:00,metaphor,Explodes used as metaphor for sudden intensification,metaphor,figurative,1,literal,0.9329234,0.0670767,0.9329234,False
The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/23/the-guardian-view-on-animal-testing-we-can-stop-sacrificing-millions-of-lives-for-our-own-health,The Guardian view on animal testing: we can stop sacrificing millions of lives for our own health | Editorial,"Science is a slaughterhouse. We rarely acknowledge the degree to which animal life underwrites the research that provides us with medicines, or the regulation that keeps us safe. Live animals were used in 2.64m officially sanctioned scientific procedures in the UK in 2024, many of them distressing or painful and many of them fatal. But the government’s new strategy to phase out animal testing – published earlier this month – suggests that in the near future emerging technologies can largely replace the use of animals in our scientific endeavours.

The UK previously banned cosmetics testing on animals, and has already taken steps to regulate and reduce their use in research. But some needlessly cruel experiments still take place: the forced swim test (FST) for example, in which a rodent is placed in a body of water it cannot escape and researchers measure whether antidepressants extend the time it struggles for life. The government says no new FST licences will be granted, in effect banning it. Similar targets are set over the next few years to end the testing of caustic chemicals on eyes and skin.

This is welcome, but there are many other widespread practices – such as giving mice tumours to research cancer – which most people would still consider acceptable, despite their obvious barbarity. When animal wellbeing is pitted so starkly against human benefit, our collective compassion has a limit. The government will succeed only if it can convince scientists and the public that these longstanding and trusted experimental methods can be replaced with something as good or better.

Fortunately, there are emerging alternatives. So-called organ-on-a-chip systems, which use lab-grown cells arranged into a miniature network that can simulate complex bodily systems, are already in use. And machine learning systems are proving as adept at predicting potential toxic effects from medicines as they have been at predicting protein structures. These approaches won’t always provide perfect insight into how a given treatment might work for humans, but of course neither do animal tests. Undergraduate scientists are still taught these classic cautionary tales: paracetamol is toxic to dogs and cats, while thalidomide was shown to be safe in rats.

Unlike the slogans and aspirations in its AI strategy, the government appears to have a real plan for applying these technologies. There is £60m in direct funding committed– and a focus on identifying specific animal research methods currently in use, measuring their effectiveness and validating animal-free alternatives that could provide similar results. And it is heartening that the strategy maps out several points over the next decade when specific alternative methods are expected to mature, rather than gesturing at technology in general as a panacea.

This is an opportunity for both scientific and economic progress. Animal testing isn’t just cruel, it is expensive and time-consuming. The EU and US have similarly committed to reduce animal experimentation, so there will be rewards for developing technology and knowhow that can be applied worldwide. But most importantly, there is a moral imperative to free these animals. Previous governments greatly reduced the number of so-called charismatic species – animals favoured by humans such as dogs and horses – used in experiments. Today, 95% of lab animals in the UK are rodents, birds or fish. Do they not deserve the same consideration?",2025-11-23 00:00:00,literal,Factual reporting on data and policy,literal,literal,0,literal,0.97843015,0.02156986,0.97843015,True
Al Jazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/11/14/why-did-us-let-dodik-off-the-hook-and-hand-europes-ailing-heart-to-russia,Why did US let Dodik off the hook and hand Europe’s ailing heart to Russia?,"The US decision to lift sanctions on the Bosnian Serb leader allowed Russia to consolidate its influence in Bosnia and left Serbia out in the cold just as it was moving closer to the West.

In a stunning geopolitical reversal, on October 29, the United States abruptly lifted sanctions on Bosnian Serb leader and genocide denier Milorad Dodik – a known Kremlin ally who has long undermined Bosnia and Herzegovina’s sovereignty. The decision, which contradicts years of US policy, intriguingly coincides with the beginning of direct dealings between Russia and Bosnia’s Serb entity, Republika Srpska.

The Russians, who had long treated Belgrade as the only authority representing all Serbs across the region, have seriously undermined Serbia’s authority recently by acknowledging Dodik as the rightful representative of Bosnia’s Serb population.

The Trump administration’s unexpected move to lift sanctions on Dodik at a time when he is building a strategic relationship with Moscow signals a potential grand bargain between world powers, raising alarming questions about what Washington gained in exchange for effectively ceding half of Bosnia to Russia’s sphere of influence.

The unexplained reversal

The US unexpectedly removed sanctions from Dodik and his network. This was a sudden, unexplained reversal of a longstanding policy. For years, the US targeted him for trying to destabilise Bosnia, denying genocide, and pushing for secession. Removing him from the sanctions list appears to give a blessing to the denial of the Bosnian genocide and creates a clear path for Bosnia’s breakup.

This move creates a glaring paradox in US foreign policy.

Dodik is one of the Kremlin’s most overt allies in Europe, openly celebrating his ties with Moscow and advocating for Russian interests. However, the US keeps strong sanctions on many other people and entities for far weaker links to Russia.

The perplexing decision to lift sanctions on him exposes a troubling inconsistency in Washington’s approach to Russia, one that undermines the credibility of its broader sanctions regime.

Citing successful lobbying by Dodik as the reason for this reversal is a weak and unconvincing justification. According to estimates, Dodik’s lobbying efforts in the US have grown to two or three times the $30m figure confirmed for 2017. The scale of his spending, however, is still a pittance compared with the vast sums deployed by other nations and interest groups that consistently fail to achieve such spectacular diplomatic victories.

Another theory for the US policy shift involves Bosnia’s mineral wealth, specifically lithium. This follows a May 21, 2025, statement by Dodik, who publicly offered the mineral resources of the Bosnian Serb entity to the US in exchange for recognition of Republika Srpska’s sovereignty.

This theory, however, contains a logical flaw: if the US’s primary interest were lithium, maintaining sanctions would provide more direct control over the resources without needing to grant Dodik anything. The inadequacy of this explanation strongly suggests that more profound, undisclosed geopolitical calculations are at work, raising alarming questions about the true price of this sudden US retreat.

Moscow dominating Serbia

For a while now, Serbia has been moving away from Russia and towards the West.

On August 29, 2024, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic announced a $3bn deal with France to buy 12 Rafale jets, signalling Belgrade’s shift towards Western security alliances.

At a joint news conference, French President Emmanuel Macron praised the agreement as “historic”, lauding Serbia’s “strategic courage” and reaffirming its European future. This did not go unnoticed in Moscow. In May 2025, Russia accused Serbia of stabbing Moscow in the back for selling weapons to Ukraine. Furthermore, in July, the Kremlin condemned Belgrade for considering joining Western sanctions against Russia.

On the day before the sanctions on him were lifted, rather than courting Washington, Dodik was in Minsk embracing Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. By meeting Dodik a day before US sanctions on him were lifted, Moscow declared a new Balkan strategy that deliberately sidelines Serbia.

Back in September, Russia’s foreign minister described Dodik as the “legitimately elected president” of the Bosnian entity Republika Srpska. But now, the official website of Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs describes Dodik as “the leader of Bosnian Serbs in Bosnia and Herzegovina.” This new designation serves multiple strategic purposes and marks a clear geopolitical shift.

Advertisement

First, it undermines the sovereignty of Bosnia by asserting a national rather than a purely regional mandate for Dodik’s authority.

Second, it directly challenges Serbia’s ambition, embodied in the concept of Srpski svet (Serbian World), to act as the central patron of all Serbs, asserting instead Russia’s claim to be the ultimate arbiter of Serb political affairs. Belgrade’s Srpski svet mirrors the Kremlin’s Ruski mir (Russian World) doctrine, with both aiming to unite ethnic and linguistic kin under a transnational cultural identity. Ultimately, these ideologies serve to expand political influence and justify intervention in neighbouring states under the pretext of protecting their diasporas.

The most potent signal of this shift came from Dodik himself. He publicly snubbed Vucic by bluntly declaring that Belgrade would have no say in the Republika Srpska. Vucic responded by citing the affront: “The other night, I saw that in Banja Luka they say that no one from Belgrade will give them orders.”

For years, Serbia has positioned itself as the paternal guardian of all Serbs, with Republika Srpska operating firmly within its political orbit. Dodik’s statement shattered this dynamic, announcing that the Serb-majority entity now answers to a different patron.

Moscow’s move has publicly split Dodik and Vucic, weakening Serbia’s power. It shows Russia will now deal directly with Bosnian separatists, ignoring the Serbian government. For Vucic, who tries to keep ties with both Europe and Russia, this is a worst-case scenario. It proves his influence is no longer needed and that Russia is now working through Banja Luka instead of Belgrade, severely reducing Serbia’s importance.

Moscow’s power play: Annexing Europe’s ailing heart

The US decision to lift sanctions has effectively allowed Moscow to take in Republika Srpska as a new Russian territory. The era of indirect influence is over; the Bosnian entity is now being governed directly from the Kremlin, fundamentally altering the balance of power in Europe.

A Russian military footprint in the Balkans is also expanding. While Russia maintains unofficial bases in Serbia, it is now likely to establish one in Banja Luka, the de facto capital of the Bosnian Serb entity, as well.

Bosnia, located in the heart of Europe, is itself shaped like a heart. For 30 years, the European Union had the chance to heal Europe’s ailing heart. The EU failed because, at its own core, it is afflicted by deep-seated racism: Islamophobia and Russophobia. The price for this hatred is now clear. Half of Europe’s heart — half of Bosnia — has effectively become a new Russian territory, a territory from which launching missiles would be far more efficient than from Kaliningrad.

The global chessboard: A tacit US-Russia understanding?

The sudden lifting of US sanctions on Dodik, followed instantly by his strategic embrace with Lavrov, is best understood not as a US policy failure but as a calculated move on the global chessboard. Lavrov’s masterstroke was to publicly empower Dodik at the direct expense of Belgrade, a clear signal to Serbia that its historical role as the primary patron of Bosnian Serbs is over. In this new alignment, Moscow demonstrates that it holds the key to power in the Bosnian entity Republika Srpska, forcefully reminding Serbia who truly commands the loyalties of its supposed kin.

This power play exploits Serbia’s fundamental and precarious dilemma. The nation is perpetually torn between its economic and political ambitions for EU integration and its deep-seated historical, cultural, and religious ties to Russia. Lavrov’s move tightens the Russian noose, forcing Belgrade into a more subservient position.

This leads to the most unsettling theory: that the US acquiescence is part of a tacit great-power trade-off. The timing and incongruity of the sanctions lift suggest it is not a retreat but a strategic bargain. Washington may have deliberately ceded its influence in Bosnia, accepting an expanded Russian sphere of influence in the Balkans, in exchange for a strategic concession from Moscow elsewhere — perhaps related to Ukraine, the Middle East, or another arena. This fits a cynical historical pattern: big powers often ignore local commitments to serve their own secret deals.

The unanswered question and the fallout

The abrupt US sanction lift, followed immediately by Dodik’s pivot to Moscow, leaves one chilling, unanswered question: what did Washington secure in return for effectively gifting half of Bosnia to Russia’s sphere of influence? This opaque bargain sacrifices decades of principled Balkan policy for an undisclosed geopolitical price, undermining US credibility and the fragile Dayton peace.

The fallout is clear: emboldened secessionists, a destabilised Europe, and a dangerous signal that hard-won democratic norms are merely currency in a new great game, leaving allies betrayed and adversaries triumphant.

For far too long, African youth have been told that democracy is something imported, something borrowed, something foreign to their identity. But history gives us a very different truth. Democracy is not an idea that arrived from the West. It is a human idea. And Africa practised it long before modern states existed.

Africa’s democratic inheritance is older than the colonial borders that sliced the continent into fragments. In the Somali shir, every man could stand, argue, and vote in open councils that decided collective affairs. The Oromo Gadaa system developed rotating leadership and fixed term limits centuries before they became fashionable anywhere else. Igbo communities governed through village assemblies that rejected kings and insisted on consensus. The Ashanti used councils of elders to check the power of chiefs and remove them when they broke trust. In Botswana, the Tswana kgotla provided public debate forums where leaders listened more than they spoke. These systems did not look identical to modern democracies, but the principle was unmistakable: power must serve the community, and the community must hold power accountable.

Democratic ideas are not confined to any one civilisation. Ancient Athens developed its own form of citizen rule. Islamic governance emphasised shura, consultation. Confucian models in East Asia built a meritocratic civil service long before Europe did. And when modern democracy regained momentum in the 18th century, America made a historic contribution by not only establishing it but sustaining it through institutions that could survive war, crisis, and political division. That legacy is real and should never be dismissed. But democracy’s story is not Western. It is human. And Africa’s contribution to it is undeniable.

Today, young Africans face a new challenge. They are living in the attention economy, where anger spreads faster than reason and where misinformation travels in seconds. This environment creates enormous pressure on leaders to react rather than reflect. It rewards the strongman’s sprint instead of the institution’s marathon. But democracies win marathons, not sprints. The short-term appeal of authoritarian certainty can never match the long-term stability of accountable institutions. Africa cannot afford to trade long-term freedom for short-term frustration.

Modern African societies are not starting from zero. Botswana’s democratic resilience, Senegal’s peaceful transfers of power, Ghana’s strengthening institutions, and Kenya’s judicial independence show that African democracies can adapt, evolve, and correct themselves. At the same time, other countries face real challenges: contested elections, corruption, political exclusion, and the weaponisation of identity. Naming these problems honestly is not a weakness. It is how democracies grow.

Reclaiming democracy today must also mean expanding it. The systems of the past often excluded women and marginalised groups. A modern African democracy must belong equally to women, young people, minorities, and all those whose voices were historically silenced. Reclaiming an inheritance does not mean returning to the past. It means carrying it forward with greater justice.

Technology is Africa’s new multiplier. Artificial intelligence, digital platforms, and open learning resources can give young Africans something no previous generation ever had: the ability to learn globally and compete globally without asking permission from any gatekeeper. Connectivity is still uneven. Infrastructure is still expensive. Policies lag behind innovation. But the potential is unmistakable. Every major leap in human history rewarded the adopters: the printing press, steam power, electricity, the green revolution, the internet, and now AI. Africa has a young population. If it embraces AI early, with strong civic values and clear safeguards, the continent can achieve a leap no region has ever achieved.

Democracy is not protected by slogans. It is protected by habits. Young Africans can strengthen democracy not only in elections but in everyday practice. Reviving local consultative forums. Creating student parliaments. Running community debates. Challenging misinformation. Defending independent journalism. Building digital literacy campaigns. These small habits create big cultures. And perhaps most importantly, Africans must reject the narrative that democracy belongs to somebody else. Authoritarianism is not African. Silence is not African. The continent’s heritage is debate, dialogue, consensus, accountability, and community decision-making. To reclaim democracy is to reclaim what Africa has always known: that power must be held in trust, not taken by force.

The future belongs to the young. If African youth defend their voice, their freedom, their diversity, their truth, and their dignity, they will build institutions stronger than any individual. They will build a continent where unity does not erase nations and where sovereignty does not silence citizens. A continent where Africa rises not as a copy of another model but as itself. Democracy is not something Africa must borrow. It is something Africa is ready to lead.

My family and I have been watching post-season baseball, and I think I have to lie down.

We've seen so many ads for drugs prescribed to treat plaque psoriasis, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis that I'm sure I've developed a rash, nausea, joint pain and dizziness. Just by watching.

iSpot, the TV ad news site, says drug companies bought $895.8 million worth of ads in sports programming last year. The commercials that run during post-season baseball are rife with talk of dermatitis, dehydration, and wheezing. It's almost a relief to see just an ad for beer, or a lizard selling car insurance.

""The baseball playoffs are watched by millions,"" Dr. Caleb Alexander, of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine Center for Drug Safety and Effectiveness, reminds us. ""These games offer drug companies a captive audience, a lot with grey hair, who may have diabetes, obesity, high cholesterol and other common diseases.""

Prescription drug ads were once banned on broadcasts. But companies argued that infringed on free speech; and the drugs could help people. The FDA now permits pharmaceutical ads, as long as what regulators call ""dual-modality risk statements"" — possible side effects — are clearly stated.

And so you see commercials that show winsome old friends dancing, biking, and shooting down forested zip lines, despite the shadow of psoriasis, insomnia, anxiety or eczema.

For decades, Deborah Willis has dedicated her career to unearthing, cataloging and showcasing Black photographers and photographs of Black people. The MacArthur ""Genius Award"" winner is the author of a spectacular collection of books including the seminal Reflections in Black: A History of Black Photographers, 1840 to the Present.

Twenty-five years after its publication, a new edition of Reflections in Black is out with 130 new images and a gallery show inspired by the book. In the expansion of this book, Willis considered the effects of migration and the importance of images for people forced to leave home.

""The aspect of migration is a central way of me reading these images, today there are so many people who are from the diaspora that are photographers now,"" she said. ""When families had to leave home, with disaster today, what do you take with you now? Photographs are what people are taking.""

Morning Edition's Michel Martin visited Willis at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, where she teaches and leads the photo department.

Here are four takeaways from their conversation.

1. Willis' upbringing shaped her love for photography

toggle caption Estate of Dr. James K. Hill, Washington, D.C.

Willis grew up in North Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where her mother had a beauty shop and kept what Willis calls: ""the Black color wheel of magazines.""

The publications included Ebony, Jet, and Tan and featured images that influenced her growing up. Her father, a policeman and tailor, was also an amateur photographer.

2. Reflections in Black started as an undergrad paper

Willis was studying at the Philadelphia College of Art (the college merged with another institution to become the University of the Arts in Philadelphia in 1985. UArts closed its doors in 2024) when she asked a professor why Black photographers were missing from the history books.

""Where are the Black photographers?"" she recalled. That question morphed into the monumental project that became Reflections in Black. She began her research by reading city directories.

""Because of segregation in the 19th century, I was able to identify with the asterisk the colored photographers … I created this list of 500,"" she said.

She took that list to the Schomburg Center in Harlem, where she found some of the photographers' images and created portfolios for each one. Later, with the help of Richard Newman, her ""publishing angel,"" the paper she wrote as an undergraduate grew into a book.

3. Frederick Douglass understood photography as biography

Frederick Douglass was one of the most photographed people during the 19th century. The writer and abolitionist is known to have had about 160 photographs and portraits made of him.

""I believe in reading his words that photography was biography,"" Willis said. ""We've not found a photograph of him smiling."" She emphasized Douglass himself collaborated with the photographer behind the lens in part as an effort to counter degrading images of Black people.

4. Willis searched for ""The Exhibit of American Negroes,"" which W.E.B. Du Bois organized for the 1900 Paris Exposition

toggle caption Library of Congress

Wills first heard about the exhibit in the 1970s, when she went to the Library of Congress looking for photographs from it. She said staff told her the photographs didn't exist.

Twenty years later, photographs from the exhibit were retrieved by a young Black man working in the archives. ""They didn't exist because they weren't processed,"" Willis told NPR.

Du Bois, she said, understood the importance of photography and often asked, ""Why aren't there more Black photographers, Black men studying photography?""

NBC News Think,https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/movies/wicked-for-good-opening-weekend-box-office-rcna245440,'Wicked: For Good' soars with record-breaking $150 million opening weekend,"“Wicked: For Good” didn’t need magic to shatter box office records.

The highly anticipated sequel to the first “Wicked” is now the No. 1 film at the domestic box office, hauling in an estimated $150 million domestically and $226 million worldwide this weekend.

The film had the biggest-ever opening weekend for a Broadway adaptation, beating out its predecessor, which opened to $112.5 million almost exactly a year ago. It also achieved the second-highest opening weekend of the year, just behind “A Minecraft Movie,” which raked in $163 million when it debuted in April.

Paul Dergarabedian, head of marketplace trends at box office data company Comscore, said he was impressed that “Wicked: For Good” outpaced “Wicked” at the box office, noting there’s never a guarantee that sequels of popular movies will perform to expectations.

“That doesn’t always happen,” he said. “It’s a testament to how much audiences around the world love ‘Wicked,’ these stars and just the way these movies are presented on the big screen.”

Dergarabedian attributed much of the film’s success to the marketing push from Universal Pictures — including a range of product partnerships, themed experiences and viral press moments from Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo — that have turned Universal Pictures’ “Wicked” franchise into a cultural event.

(NBC News and Universal Pictures share Comcast as a parent company.)

Movie theaters this weekend were decked out in pink-and-green popcorn tins and drink cups, with some even offering “Wicked”-themed photo-ops for viewers. Online, fans shared videos of themselves dressed in Elphaba- or Glinda-inspired outfits as they headed to the theaters.

The second installment of the two-part film series takes on slightly darker tones than the fluffier first movie, exploring Elphaba’s exile as the Wicked Witch of the West while Glinda, now living a glamorous life as the Good Witch, wrestles with complicated feelings about their friendship.

“Wicked: For Good” opened to a 95% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes, as well as an A on Cinemascore. Dergarabedian said he expects the film, which debuted right ahead of Thanksgiving weekend, to have long-term playability going into the holidays.

“This isn’t just a one-weekend wonder,” Dergarabedian said. “This is a film that’s perfectly tailored for audiences over the next six weeks, heading all the way to New Year’s Eve and beyond.”

He predicts the film will help fuel one of the biggest-ever Thanksgiving weeks for movie theaters, along with the upcoming Wednesday release of “Zootopia 2.”

After a quiet October, he said, “Wicked: For Good” is kicking off the momentum for a slew of potential end-of-year box office hits, including “Five Nights at Freddy’s 2” on Dec. 5, as well as “Avatar: Fire and Ash” and “The SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants” on Dec. 19.",2025-11-23 19:40:00.320000+00:00,literal,Factual reporting on data and economics,literal,literal,0,figurative,0.14809912,0.8519009,0.8519009,False

Al Jazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/22/indian-trade-unions-oppose-new-labour-codes-call-for-demonstrations,"Indian trade unions oppose new labour codes, call for demonstrations","The unions demand the laws be withdrawn before nationwide protests they plan to hold on Wednesday.

Ten large Indian trade unions have condemned the government’s rollout on Friday of new labour codes, the biggest such overhaul in decades, as a “deceptive fraud” against workers.

The unions, aligned with parties opposing Prime Minister Narendra Modi, demanded in a statement late on Friday that the laws be withdrawn before nationwide protests they plan to hold on Wednesday.

One of the trade unions, Centre of Indian Trade Unions, organised protest marches on Saturday in the eastern city Bhubaneswar, where hundreds of workers gathered and burned copies of the new labour codes.

Modi’s government implemented the four labour codes, approved by parliament five years ago, as it seeks to simplify work rules, some dating to British colonial rule, and liberalise conditions for investment.

It says the changes improve worker protections. While the new rules offer social security and minimum-wage benefits, they also allow companies to hire and fire workers more easily.

Unions have strongly opposed the changes, organising multiple nationwide protests over the past five years.

The Labour Ministry did not immediately respond on Saturday to a Reuters news agency request for comment on the union demands. The government has held over a dozen consultations with unions since June 2024, an internal ministry document on the labour codes shows.

The rules allow longer factory shifts and night work for women, while raising the threshold for firms that need prior approval for layoffs to 300 workers from 100, giving companies greater flexibility in workforce management.

Businesses have long criticised India’s work rules as a drag on manufacturing, which contributes less than a fifth to the country’s nearly $4 trillion economy.

But the Association of Indian Entrepreneurs expressed concern that the new rules would significantly increase operating costs for small and midsize enterprises and disrupt business continuity across key sectors.

It asked the government for transitional support and flexible implementation mechanisms. Not all unions oppose the overhaul.

The right-wing Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, aligned with Modi’s party, called on states to implement them after consultations on some of the codes.

Al Jazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/28/the-rise-of-global-boycotts-against-israels-genocide-in-gaza,The rise of global boycotts against Israel’s genocide in Gaza,"From streets to supermarkets, global boycotts for Gaza have grown as a fragile ceasefire holds for now.

Protests to end Israel’s mistreatment of Palestinians are getting louder and larger.

Seeing the livestreamed genocide Israel perpetrated in Gaza has had an effect globally, with the call to boycott Israel at an all-time high.

Quiet boycotts, which started in supermarkets nearly two decades ago, have turned into widely used apps that help millions make choices about purchases.

Campus protests and encampments in the US and Canada have led some major education institutions to cut ties with Israeli counterparts, while investments into Israel have dipped, and some of the world’s largest economies have recognised Palestine as a state.

Dr Mohammed Mustafa is a Palestinian Australian doctor whose parents left their native Deir el-Balah in central Gaza decades ago in search of a better life.

He volunteered in Gaza’s hospitals over the past two years and has shared it all on social media, including his visits to Gaza, attending conferences and advocating for Palestinians.

He says the experience of watching a genocide livestreamed has changed many people.

“For years, Palestinians have felt like we were shouting into a void. Now, to see people across continents marching, creating art, and demanding justice – it gives you hope that the world’s conscience is finally waking up.

“When I was younger, I never imagined this level of global solidarity… Seeing that tide turn now … it’s deeply moving. It feels like truth is finally finding its voice,” he continues.

Nearly 50,000 pro-Palestine protests in two years

In recent months, pro-Palestine protests have seen a noticeable uptick – between May and September 2025, they increased by 43 percent compared with the five months prior.

Over the past two years, there have been at least 49,000 pro-Palestinian protests across 133 countries and territories, according to the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED).

The highest number of pro-Palestine demonstrations was recorded in Yemen (15,266), followed by Morocco (5,482), the US (5,346), Turkiye (2,349), Iran (1,919), Pakistan (1,539), France (1,397), Italy (1,390), Spain (1,102) and Australia (967).

The map below shows the locations of the 49,000 pro-Palestinian protests held between October 7, 2023, and October 3, 2025.

The growth of a boycott

Israel has grown increasingly isolated, the founder of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement, Omar Barghouti, told Al Jazeera.

BDS launched in 2005 to advocate for Palestinian rights and end Israel’s occupation and apartheid through targeting complicity, not individuals, he said.

Barghouti is from a Palestinian family that is deeply involved in politics and culture. Among the famous Barghoutis is Fatah leader Marwan Barghouti, who is serving out several life sentences in an Israeli prison.

“The BDS movement has played the most important role in exacerbating the isolation of Israel’s regime of settler-colonialism, apartheid and now genocide,” Barghouti said.

Barghouti noted that even the chairman of the Israel Export Institute, Avi Balashnikov, had admitted to challenges in global trade.

Balashnikov, at the Mind the Tech Conference 2024, said: “Economic boycotts and BDS organisations present major challenges, and in some countries, we are forced to operate under the radar.”

“BDS has achieved this impact by channelling the immense grief, rage and solidarity expressed by tens of millions worldwide into strategic, nonviolent, and very effective boycott and divestment campaigns,” Barghouti adds.

The BDS movement has identified numerous companies that are considered complicit in Israel’s occupation, human rights violations, or apartheid policies.

Their campaigns are divided into three main groups:

Priority boycott targets: Companies and institutions with a proven record of complicity in Israeli apartheid and occupation. The BDS movement calls for a complete boycott of these brands.

Companies and institutions with a proven record of complicity in Israeli apartheid and occupation. The BDS movement calls for a complete boycott of these brands.

Organic boycotts: Grassroots campaigns started by local communities, which BDS supports because of the boycotted brands’ complicity in Israel’s actions against Palestinians.

How are people boycotting?

Sumayya Rashid*, a 45-year-old expat mother living in the United Arab Emirates, has been teaching her 11-year-old daughter about what Palestinian children are experiencing and explaining to her how buying certain brands indirectly supports the genocide.

“We no longer buy anything from McDonald’s, KFC, Pizza Hut or Carrefour. These were brands that we would consume before the boycott,” says Rashid, adding that they have found local replacements where possible.

Rashid says her daughter is immersed in Palestinian culture because of school and the community around it.

“She may not understand the extent of the genocide, but she does know we can’t be supporting Israel as they are the instigators of the violence.”

Rashid has found that it is easy to find alternatives in the UAE, but she relies on the Boycat app to double-check any items she is not sure about.

Boycat is one of several mobile apps launched over the past years to help consumers identify products targeted for boycott – it has partnered with the BDS movement, which helps keep its list up to date and ensure it follows BDS goals.

Across the Atlantic, in Toronto, Canada, is 26-year-old Jaspreet Kaur*, who feels there are some restrictions on speaking openly in support of Palestine in Canada.

“Palestine brought a lot of things into perspective for a lot of us. It’s just even looking down at your cup of morning coffee, and seeing this is such a core need, a necessity, which is a sheer luxury.

“Kids can’t play in the street without the fear of being bombed – that’s something I never have to think about,” says Kaur.

“I don’t remember the last time I had Starbucks or McDonald’s, or used Airbnb or booking.com,” she says adamantly.

Kaur says she has boycotted as much as possible, using apps to guide her, but that some consumer items from multinationals have crept back into her life due to budget constraints.

Beyond her personal shopping choices, Kaur has found it difficult to be vocal about supporting Palestine while working in corporate finance.

“I don’t go to as many protests as I would like to, I’ve taken off my Palestinian phone case and removed the Palestinian flag from my Instagram bio, I can’t be as loud as I need, as I want to personally,” she says.

As an immigrant waiting for her citizenship, Kaur says she feels her actions and thoughts on Palestine are not so accepted publicly and at work.

What has the boycott’s effect been?

Boycotts have not only affected the bottom lines of several companies complicit in Israel’s occupation but have also led to investments being pulled out of Israel and international embargoes on it, increasing economic and political pressure.

In November 2024, French retailer Carrefour closed all its stores in Jordan.

BDS has long highlighted Carrefour’s business ties with Israeli firms in illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank.

The company also exited Kuwait, Oman, and Bahrain, its locations being reopened as HyperMax, a local grocery chain launched by regional franchisee, Majid Al Futtaim.

The closures are seen as a major win for the movement, demonstrating the power of consumer-led campaigns on multinational corporations.

Two of the largest US food and beverage chains, McDonald’s and Starbucks, have felt the effect of boycotts, facing declining sales and reputational backlash, particularly across the Middle East and other Muslim countries like Malaysia and Indonesia.

During an earnings call in January 2024, McDonald’s Chief Executive Officer Chris Kempczinski said the fast food giant had seen a “meaningful impact” in several markets.

Starbucks reported three consecutive quarters of global sales declines, with revenue down 2 percent for the year 2024.

In September, the giant announced plans to close dozens of US outlets and lay off some 900 employees as part of a $1bn restructuring initiative to reverse declining performance.

Divestments, sanctions, and diplomatic measures

In September, the Spanish government cancelled a weapons deal with Israel worth nearly 700 million euros ($815m). Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez had previously announced an upcoming law banning military trade with Israel, which came into effect on October 9.

In 2024, Norway’s pension fund and France’s AXA divested from Israeli assets linked to settlements.

Ireland, Denmark, and the Netherlands’ pension funds also withdrew investments in Israeli-linked companies, including Caterpillar, Expedia, and TripAdvisor, due to concerns over human rights violations and involvement in illegal Israeli settlements.

In June, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Norway and the United Kingdom formally sanctioned far-right Israeli ministers Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich for “incitement of violence” against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza.

In the same month, Ireland, Slovenia and Spain called for the suspension of the EU-Israel Association Agreement.

Sweden has also asked the European Council to adopt sanctions “against Israeli ministers who promote illegal settlement activities and actively work against a negotiated two-state solution”.

For a Palestinian witnessing the turning of the global tide, Mustafa says he feels the movement for Palestine has become “one of the most dynamic social justice movements of our time”.

“It has brought together people from every background – faith-based, secular, Indigenous, and global – uniting them under a shared demand for human dignity.

“Because of that, I believe the Palestinian movement will shape how future struggles for justice are fought and understood,” he said.

UN monitoring

The UN Office of Human Rights, since 2020, has maintained a database of companies that are profiting from Israel’s illegal settlement enterprise in the occupied West Bank.

In its September 2025 update, it listed 158 firms operating inside settlements deemed unlawful by the International Court of Justice.

While nearly 90 percent of the companies are Israeli, the list also includes multinationals registered in Canada, China, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, the UK and the US.

These include well-known companies like Airbnb, Booking.com, Expedia, Motorola, Re/Max and TripAdvisor.

Those aged 16-24 who can’t live at home often end up in supported housing. This could be a shared flat or a hostel, where specialist staff are on hand to help. But such young people frequently have to cover service charges and bills – at an age when they should be building a future, not worrying about basic costs.

It’s good that the state steps in to support vulnerable young people. But wrong that it can undermine that help in practice. For the last eight years, campaigners have warned that young people in supported housing are penalised more harshly for earning than their non-homeless counterparts – and it’s a UK-wide problem. For every £1 these youngsters earn over their small earnings allowance, their housing benefit is reduced by 65p, compared with 55p for those in the private rental sector. Perversely, the flaw crept in during reforms meant to guarantee people on benefits were always better off in work.

Penalising young homeless people who want to work more is clearly counterintuitive. Anecdotally, those in the housing sector say it causes plenty of young people to forego meaningful work. You can see why: someone working 10 hours could lose more than £100 a month for picking up an 11th hour of work. That can narrow their options, as they find themselves having to be prescriptive about their hours, competing with peers who can be more flexible. In the longer run, it can reduce their prospects. In some cases, staff find themselves in the unenviable position of dissuading young people from taking a job lest they put their housing in jeopardy.

For a government that wants to “make work pay”, this can’t be right. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has a chance to fix the problem in the budget. Young people have been the worst affected by rising unemployment, and while Ms Reeves has made the right moves – promising paid work for young people on universal credit who haven’t found education or employment after 18 months – those plans remain sketchy. It surely makes sense for Ms Reeves to ensure that incentives to work apply equally to all young people.

A new campaign, fronted by 150 youth and homeless organisations, warns of a financial “cliff edge” that makes rent unaffordable and increases the risk of arrears. Charities say the earnings allowance should rise from a token £5 to about £57, and the housing benefit taper should be brought down from 65% to 55% to match universal credit.

These are sensible, practical measures that would ensure that some of the country’s poorest people get financial help. It would also signal that the government is invested in making the country fairer for them. The homeless charity Centrepoint says it’s a win-win policy. The Treasury, it calculates, will gain £5m a year as more young people move into work. Once wider outcomes – such as improved health and reduced crime – are considered, the net gain is £13m annually.

There is a generational crisis bubbling under Britain’s surface in which young people face rising unemployment, insecure housing and falling real wages. Their futures, it feels, are being shaped less by opportunity and more by precarity. If ministers truly want to “make work pay” for everyone, they’ll have to explain why 30,000 young homeless people are the one group excluded from that promise.

Trump keeps signalling that he is willing to compromise, but his original plan put Ukraine in a very tough starting position, handing Vladimir Putin concessions that Russia has so far failed to gain on the battlefield.

It is true Russia has made recent advances – especially around Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad in Donetsk province, and in parts of Zaporizhzhia. And Ukraine lacks the troops and firepower to retake all the territory lost since 2022, let alone Crimea. But the Ukrainian army isn’t about to unravel, and neither is Putin close to fulfilling his original objective: conquering the four Ukrainian provinces of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. Russia fully controls only Luhansk. This war could drag on until the summer. By then, Putin’s forces will have fought Ukraine for as long as Stalin’s fought Nazi Germany.

Ukraine’s shortages are well known: too few soldiers to hold an 800-mile contact line and inadequate air defences after Trump severely cut direct US military assistance. Europe’s stepped-up support hasn’t compensated. What is remarkable, given Ukraine’s disadvantages, is the scale of Russia’s losses: more than 1 million casualties according to the UK Ministry of Defence, nearly 150,000 confirmed dead, and more than 23,000 pieces of equipment destroyed or damaged. Ukrainian deep strikes on Russian refineries – at least 17 by mid-November – have caused fuel shortages, long lines at petrol stations, panic buying, higher prices, rationing and a cut in refining capacity by up to a fifth.

It is in this context that Trump unveiled his peace plan – an early Christmas present for Putin. It was negotiated by Kirill Dmitriev, a Putin confidant and CEO of Russia’s $10bn sovereign wealth fund, and on the US side by Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner. The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, seems to have played a minimal role.

Witkoff and Kushner may be shrewd business negotiators, but they have scant diplomatic experience and even less knowledge of Ukraine. (Witkoff has recited Kremlin talking points after meeting Putin.) Their influence stems largely from personal ties to Trump. Pitting them against someone like Dmitriev virtually guaranteed a deal tilted toward Russia. A few examples illustrate the imbalance:

Ukraine – not Russia – is required to cap its armed forces at 600,000. Russia faces no comparable constraints.

Ukraine must amend its constitution to drop its commitment to joining Nato.

Russia had long expressed concerns about Nato expansion; President Boris Yeltsin objected in the mid-1990s, well before Putin took the helm. But acknowledging Russia’s concerns is different from claiming Ukraine’s Nato membership was imminent in 2022. Between Nato’s 2008 Bucharest summit – where it vaguely promised eventual membership – and the invasion, Ukraine made no concrete progress toward accession. Had Nato truly wanted Ukraine in, it could have moved swiftly, as it did with Finland and Sweden.

And that’s only the beginning. Trump’s plan recognises Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk as de-facto Russian – granting Putin parts of Donetsk he hasn’t captured. It freezes battle lines, allowing Russia to retain territory seized in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. The plan doesn’t give Putin everything, but it gives him enough to claim victory.

What does Russia concede? Virtually nothing. The plan does say frozen Russian assets will help rebuild Ukraine, but Moscow was never going to recover that money anyway.

Meanwhile, Russia receives further rewards: readmission to the G8; reintegration into the global economy; negotiations toward a staged lifting of sanctions; and cooperation with the US on energy, infrastructure, AI and rare earths. The plan also demands Ukrainian de-Nazification, validating Russia’s absurd narrative that Ukraine is riddled with Nazis – something any visitor can see is false.

Despite Russia’s ongoing war crimes – atrocities in Bucha, Irpin and Borodianka; forced relocations to Russia of children; repeated strikes on apartment buildings, most recently in the western city of Ternopil; and abuse, torture, and execution of Ukrainian prisoners of war – the plan grants the Kremlin full immunity from prosecution, negating international criminal court warrants for Putin and his top officials.

None of this should be surprising. Trump has been open about his admiration for Putin. He has been disdainful toward Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He has even blamed Zelenskyy for starting the war.

Some commentators, echoing Trump, argue that Ukraine’s war is futile and not a vital US interest. But that hardly justifies forcing Ukraine to accept a one-sided deal crafted without its participation – and accompanied by an ultimatum of mere days.

Other supporters of the plan insist, as Trump has, that it’s time to end the blood-letting, even as Israel’s strikes in Gaza continue during the ceasefire underwritten by Trump. Some who rightly criticise Israel’s conduct seem oddly indifferent to Russia’s war crimes.

Trump certainly has the authority to halt weapons deliveries to Ukraine – his decision to do so was another boon for Putin. But he has gone far further. By concocting a plan that may as well have been written in the Kremlin and excluding Ukraine from negotiations, he hasn’t just put his thumb on the scale. He’s put his hand on it. That’s morally indefensible and strategically myopic.

There is some positive news. After reports that Rubio told members of Congress the 28-point plan was produced by Russia, he held talks with Andriy Yermak, Zelenskyy’s closest adviser, to rework it based on Ukraine’s reactions – although Rubio has denied this. Trump accused Ukraine of ingratitude but added that the plan was “not my final offer” and that his deadline could be extended. If the upshot of all this is that Trump’s proposal doesn’t fly, that will be a good thing – above all for Ukraine.",2025-11-24 00:00:00,metaphor,Battle lines used as metaphor for conflict positions,metaphor,figurative,1,literal,0.8684892,0.13151081,0.8684892,False
NBC News Think,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/zohran-mamdani-trump-fascist-despot-white-house-meeting-rcna245309,Zohran Mamdani says he still believes Trump is a 'fascist' and a 'despot' after White House meeting,"New York Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani said Saturday that he still believes President Donald Trump is a “fascist” and a “despot,” but he viewed their first face-to-face meeting at the White House on Friday as an “opportunity” to work together on lowering the cost of living for New Yorkers.

After months of trading insults during the campaign, the two were friendly during the meeting, with the president telling reporters he’ll be “cheering” for Mamdani, and the mayor-elect calling the meeting “productive.”

Following their meeting, Mamdani was asked by reporters if he stood by his decision to call Trump a “fascist” during his campaign.

“That’s OK, you can just say it,” Trump told him, jokingly. “It’s easier, it’s easier than explaining it.”

On Saturday, Mamdani told “Meet the Press” moderator Kristen Welker that he does still believe the president is a fascist.

“After President Trump said that, I said, ‘Yes,’” Mamdani said.

He added, “That’s something I’ve said in the past and I say today. And I think what I appreciated about the conversation that I had with the president was that we were not shy about the places of disagreement, about the politics that has brought us to this moment, and we also wanted to focus on what it could look like to deliver on a shared analysis of an affordability crisis for New Yorkers.”

Mamdani referred to other past negative comments about Trump, telling Welker, “Everything that I’ve said in the past, I continue to believe.”

“I’m not coming into the Oval Office to make a point or make a stand. I’m coming in there to deliver for New Yorkers,” he added.

The mayor-elect also spoke about his attitude going into the meeting and why it ended up so friendly.

“I thought again and again about what it would mean for New Yorkers if we could establish a productive relationship that would focus on the issues that those New Yorkers stay up late at night thinking about,” rather than keep trading barbs, Mamdani told Welker.

“When you actually ask New Yorkers and you listen to them, you hear it come back to the issues that animated not just the conversation the president and I had with the press after our meeting, but frankly, in the meeting itself,” Mamdani added.

The mayor-elected pointed to Trump’s own campaign message last year, which included promises to lower costs for Americans on Day 1 of his second term.

On Saturday, Mamdani said he went out of his way during the mayoral campaign to speak to New Yorkers living in the Bronx and Queens who had voted for Trump in 2024.

“I shared with the president that when I asked those New Yorkers why did they vote for the president, they told me again and again, it was cost of living, cost of living, cost of living,” the mayor-elect said. “And when the president and I were speaking, we were speaking about what is preventing from delivering on that affordability agenda.”

In the weeks leading up to Election Day, Trump frequently bashed Mamdani online, calling him a “communist lunatic” and threatening to cut off federal funding for New York City if voters elected Mamdani, who refers to himself as a democratic socialist. Mamdani often shot back, once calling Trump a “despot.”

On Friday, after reporters asked the pair about that particular insult, the president said, “I’ve been called much worse than a despot,” adding, “I think he’ll change his mind after we get to working together.”

On the eve of the election, Trump even endorsed Mamdani’s strongest opponent, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat-turned-independent who ran in the general election after losing to Mamdani in the Democratic primary.

In his victory speech, Mamdani spoke forcefully against the Trump administration, promising that “New York will be the light” in political darkness and telling Trump to “turn the volume up.”

On Sunday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett spoke about the Trump-Mamdani meeting, saying that Trump plans to work with the new mayor on affordability but that “none of those [policies] really jump off the page for me as really strong ideas.”

Still, Hassett added, ""I think that if Mamdani cares as much as he appears to for the people of New York, President Trump obviously does, I think that there’s a lot of positive work that can be done together.""

Mamdani said Saturday that he and the president also spoke about Trump’s threats to send National Guard troops into New York City, as he’s done in several other major Democratic-led cities in recent months.

Mamdani didn’t answer questions about whether Trump ruled out the possibility of sending troops to New York City, but said, “What I told him is that what separates New York City from anywhere else in the country is we have the NYPD, and I trust the NYPD to deliver public safety, and to me, that is something that I know that they can do, that they have done, and they will continue to do under my leadership.”

Asked at the White House on Saturday whether he planned to send troops to New York City, Trump said simply, “If they need it.”

“Right now, other places need it more, but if they need — we had a very good meeting yesterday. We talked about that, but if they need it, I would do it,” Trump told reporters.

On Sunday, Hassett also addressed Trump's threats during the campaign to withhold federal funds from New York City if Mamdani was elected.

""Well, it feels like he doesn’t mean it now, and I guess it — we’ll have to wait and see what Mamdani does,"" Hassett said.

One of Mamdani’s key campaign promises was to raise taxes on the city’s highest earners to fund key policy objectives. To do so, he’ll need the blessing of Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul and state legislators in Albany.

The mayor-elect didn’t answer questions about whether Hochul has committed to helping him raise taxes, but said the two are both committed to making New York City more affordable.

“I think she’ll work with me to deliver on affordability. I think raising taxes make the most sense,” Mamdani said. “If there’s any alternatives that raise the same amount of money, I’m open.”

On Saturday, Mamdani also spoke about his relationship with the nation’s Democratic leaders.

In the months leading up to the election, many were hesitant to endorse the self-described democratic socialist. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., never endorsed Mamdani, and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., only did so less than two weeks before Election Day.

Still, Mamdani last week urged members of New York’s Democratic Socialists of America chapter not to endorse a primary challenger to Jeffries.

And on Saturday, Mamdani told “Meet the Press” that he supports Jeffries becoming the speaker of the House if Democrats retake the majority in the 2026 midterm elections.

Mamdani also spoke about his conversation with former President Barack Obama after his victory, saying the two spoke about “the importance of what it looks like, not only to inspire hope, but to sustain it, and then to deliver on it.”",2025-11-23 22:14:55.689000+00:00,literal,Factual reporting on policy and elections,literal,literal,0,figurative,0.1858523,0.81414765,0.81414765,False
Al Jazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/24/who-was-haytham-ali-tabatabai-hezbollah-official-killed-by-israel,"Who was Haytham Ali Tabatabai, Hezbollah official killed by Israel?","Hezbollah says Tabatabai was a member since group’s foundation and held several senior military roles.

Israel has attacked the Haret Hreik area in the southern suburbs of Lebanon’s capital, Beirut, killing five people, including Hezbollah’s highest ranking military official.

Sunday’s attack, which took place amid an uptick in Israeli attacks across Lebanon, was the first on Beirut’s southern suburbs in several months and the first without warning since last year’s ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah was announced.

Haytham Ali Tabatabai, Hezbollah’s chief of staff, also known as Sayyid Abu Ali, was among those targeted and killed. This was the third attempt on his life, according to Israeli media, which reported that the two prior attempts occurred during last year’s war with Israel, which culminated in a United States-brokered ceasefire in November 2024.

Israel has since been accused of violating that ceasefire on a near-daily basis by United Nations experts. Hezbollah has responded to Israel’s continued attacks once, in December.

Who was Haytham Ali Tabatabai?

Before the attack, Tabatabai’s name was not widely known in Lebanon. Hezbollah’s military operatives tend to work in the shadows to avoid Israeli assassinations.

But since his death on Sunday, it has been revealed that Tabatabai held many senior positions within the armed political group during his tenure.

He was born in 1968 in Bashoura, a neighbourhood in Beirut, to Lebanese parents although his father reportedly had Iranian roots. He grew up in southern Lebanon and reportedly joined Hezbollah in the 1980s.

In its official announcement, Hezbollah said Tabatabai had been part of the group since its founding in 1982 as a resistance movement against the Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon. In the post-war period, Hezbollah grew to become Lebanon’s strongest political party and military force, serving in Lebanon’s parliament and having ministers in several governments.

Tabatabai was a senior military official in Hezbollah with extensive military experience. He reportedly took part in a number of field operations in Israeli-occupied southern Lebanon and led Hezbollah’s Nabatieh axis, or command area, from 1996 until Israel withdrew from southern Lebanon in 2000.

According to Hezbollah, Tabatabai then led the Khiam axis from 2000 until 2008 and was in command during the July 2006 war, which saw Israel and Hezbollah fight to a draw after 34 days. The group also said Tabatabai participated in establishing Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force.

Later, he was responsible for Hezbollah’s operations along the border with Syria and took over responsibilities for the operations branch during last year’s war with Israel.

According to Israeli media reports, Tabatabai led Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force in Syria and Yemen before replacing Ali Karaki, who was assassinated during last year’s war, as commander of Hezbollah’s southern front.

He was appointed as Hezbollah’s chief of staff after the war, in which most of Hezbollah’s senior military leaders were killed by Israel.

“Tabatabai was the one reorganising Hezbollah’s military leadership, and the targeting of the southern suburbs of Beirut is an indication that the Lebanese state has no guarantees against the expansion of such attacks,” Sohaib Jawhar, a nonresident fellow at the Beirut-based Badil, the Alternative Policy Institute, told Al Jazeera.

What has Hezbollah said about his death?

In its statement, Hezbollah confirmed the loss of “the great martyr jihadist commander” known as Sayyid Abu Ali and described Israel’s assassination as a “treacherous attack on the Haret Hreik area in the suburbs of Beirut”.

Mahmoud Qmati, vice president of the group’s Political Council, lamented “yet another ceasefire violation” and accused Israel of escalating the conflict “with the green light given by the United States”.

Hezbollah released a compilation video showing footage of Tabatabai operating in the field.

It also confirmed the deaths of four other Hezbollah members: Qassem Hussein Berjawi, Rifaat Ahmad Hussein, Mostafa Asaad Berro and Ibrahim Ali Hussein.

Hezbollah MP Ali Ammar accused Israel of again violating the ceasefire.

“Every attack on Lebanon is a crossing of a red line, and this aggression is inherent in the entity that targets Lebanon’s dignity, sovereignty and the security of its citizens,” he said.

What has the Lebanese state said?

Just two days before the attack, Lebanese President Joseph Aoun announced the government’s intention to enter peace negotiations with Israel with support from the international community.

After the attack on Sunday, however, Aoun called on the international community to intervene to stop Israeli attacks on his country.

Frustration has been building in parts of Lebanon as some locals feel the government is not properly equipped or willing to respond to Israel’s repeated aggressions. Many residents in southern Lebanon have expressed feelings of abandonment by the Lebanese government because it has been unable to prevent repeated Israeli attacks or rebuild destroyed homes.

What has Israel said?

After Sunday’s strike, Israel said it “remains committed to the understandings agreed upon between the State of Israel and Lebanon”, likely referring to the existing ceasefire.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the strike had been ordered after recommendations from the defence minister and the Israeli army’s chief of staff, and he justified it by accusing Tabatabai of posing a threat to Israeli security.

The Israeli army released a statement, saying: “Tabatabai commanded most of Hezbollah’s units and worked extensively to restore their readiness for war with Israel. The [Israeli military] will act against attempts to rebuild and rearm Hezbollah and will operate forcefully to remove any threat against Israel.”

Was the US aware of the attack beforehand?

According to the US news website Axios, US officials were aware that an “escalation” was expected but were not informed of the details of this particular strike. An official told Axios the US had been informed by Israel’s government directly after the strike.

What happens now?

Qmati said Israel’s strike had crossed a “red line” and the group’s leadership would now consider whether a response was warranted.

“The strike on the southern suburbs today opens the door to an escalation of assaults all over Lebanon,” he said.",2025-11-24 00:00:00,literal,Factual reporting on reporting and policy,literal,literal,0,literal,0.9233479,0.07665208,0.9233479,True
The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/nov/21/inseperable-sensuous-and-confident-the-kessler-twins-were-pioneers-of-variety-show-culture,"Inseparable, sensuous and confident, the Kessler twins were pioneers of variety show culture","When Dean Martin announced the Kessler sisters’ appearance on his show in 1966, he remarked that he had been desperate to book them not just because the German-born dancer-singers were “so pretty and so talented”, but “also because they’re twins, that means there are two of them”. “They’re a double,” he added with a nod to his half-drunk crooner persona, “and there’s nothing I like more than a double”.

The two sisters, who died by joint assisted suicide earlier this week, also performed with Frank Sinatra, Harry Belafonte and Fred Astaire, but the American market never impressed them much. In 1964 they turned down a role in Elvis’s Viva Las Vegas for fear of being pigeonholed in American musical comedies.

Instead, it was in continental Europe that the duo truly left a mark on culture – in their native Germany but especially so in Italy, where they broke the mould of acceptable mainstream TV entertainment and paved the way for a new generation of empowered female performers.

Born in 1936 in Saxony, Alice and Ellen Kessler joined the Leipzig Opera children’s ballet two years after the end of the second world war and were due to move straight on to the attached dance school. But after escaping through the iron curtain to join their father in Düsseldorf in 1952, their breakthrough came in West Germany instead. They acted in a string of popular musical comedies, and in 1955 they were discovered by the director of the Lido cabaret theatre in Paris and became part of Margaret Kelly’s Bluebell Girls. They represented West Germany at Eurovision in 1959, an experience they later called ein misserfolg (“a flop”) – their entry, Heute abend woll’n wir tanzen geh’n, (Tonight We Want to Go Dancing) placed 8th out of 12.

It was their move to Italy in the early 1960s that turned them into true showbiz icons. They made their debut on Italian TV in the variety show Giardino d’Inverno (Winter Garden) in 1961, which evolved into Studio Uno the same year. For Studio Uno, they danced and sang the opening theme tunes, most notably Da-da-un-pa, a typical show tune with a fun-and-fancy nonsense chorus. Upon seeing them, screenwriter and playwright Ennio Flaiano chauvinistically described them as “two pairs of legs and one head”.

But beneath the glitz was serious craftswomanship. French cabaret, Austro-German operetta, their ballet training and Broadway all influenced their act as soubrettes – the French word used by Italians to indicate women who could sing, dance, and banter with equal confidence.

The emphasis was always on their foot- and legwork, and in culturally conservative 1960s Italy, showing exposed legs was still deemed scandalous to the point that they had to have them covered with thick, opaque tights. In his obituary for Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, journalist, author and TV history scholar Aldo Cazzullo noted that it was only after a couple of years’ worth of performances that the Kesslers were allowed to wear nylon tights.

This, in turn, provided commercial opportunities: hosiery titan Omsa promptly hired them for commercials in which they were joined by impish choreographer Don Lurio, in a segment aptly titled “Che gambe!” (“What legs!”). Their other big Studio Uno hit, 1965’s La notte è piccola, confidently affirmed their right to have fun: “The night is too short for us,” they sang. “There’s little time to dance and sing”.

While they did fewer variety performances in the 1970s, they posed in the nude, at the age of 39, for the January 1975 Playboy Italia issue, which achieved the 1975 equivalent of virality, outselling any previous issue. Their combination of song, dance and non-vulgar sensuality proved immensely influential for the leading showgirls of the 1970s and 80s, serving as the blueprint for Raffaella Carrà, the biggest and most enduring star to emerge from Italy’s variety show culture. Carrà bared her midriff like the twins had shown their legs; her hits Ma che musica and Felicità tà tà feel like spiritual successors of Da-da-un-pa and La notte è piccola; and the twins appeared to symbolically pass the baton to the next generation when they appeared as guests on an April 1974 episode of variety show Milleluci hosted by Carrà and vocal powerhouse Mina. In one segment, the four women sang about an aspect of their performance and their physiques that most appealed to male viewers. As Italian TV historian Rachel Haworth writes in her book The Many Meanings of Mina, this moment seemed to be both a product of the male gaze and a sly subversion, “as the women use their bodies to illustrate their objectification”.

Alice and Ellen remained inseparable even after they retired from show business. In the early 1960s, clad in top hats, shimmery bodices, they had sung Wir wollen niemals auseinandergeh’n (“we never want to be apart”), a 1959 schlager by Heidi Brühl. The original is an operetta-like waltz and a proclamation of endless romantic love, but the twins’ swing-like take emphasised their sisterly and artistic bond: “Wir wollen immer zueinandersteh’n / Mag auf der grossen Welt auch noch soviel gescheh’n”. “We always want to stand side-by-side / Whatever happens in the big wide world”.

In a 2024 interview they gave to the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, they stated: “Our desire is to leave this world together, on the same day – the idea of one of us going first is very hard to bear.”",2025-11-21 00:00:00,literal,Factual reporting on reporting and economics,literal,literal,0,literal,0.57494044,0.4250595,0.57494044,True

I’ve been a runner for over a decade, so I’ve experienced it plenty of times. The culprit? Wearing the wrong sneakers for my arch type.

Up until recently, I wasn’t able to define arch support or tell you what my arch type was. Many runners can’t, which is a problem — arch support is a crucial piece of the puzzle when shopping for sneakers, and it can be the difference between hitting your performance goals or not.

Below, I talked to experts about how to shop for running shoes with arch support, and why arch support is so important. Experts also explained how to figure out your arch type, and shared their favorite running sneakers for flat, high and neutral arches.

What is arch support?

“Arch support refers to the structural components in footwear that help maintain the natural alignment of the foot’s arch,” says Dr. Anne Sharkey, a board-certified podiatrist at North Austin Foot & Ankle Institute in Texas. It prevents excessive pronation (rolling inward) or supination (rolling outward) in the foot, which reduces the risk of pain, fatigue and injuries like plantar fasciitis and shin splints.

Your foot has multiple arches, but when people talk about arch support, they’re referring to the arch in the middle of your foot. It spans the length of your underfoot and you can see it when you look at your feet from the side. There’s three arch types — flat, high and neutral — and each one requires specific types of support from shoes. There’s also variability among arch types in terms of severity and foot structure, so some people need shoes with more prominent support than others — consult a podiatrist if you want personalized recommendations.

How I picked the best running shoes with arch support

Different arch types require different types of support. Below, I broke down what features experts recommend looking for in running sneakers for flat, high and neutral arches. If you don’t know your arch type, learn how to find it here. Also, remember that arch type is only one piece of the puzzle when it comes to shopping for running sneakers — to learn more about what you should look out for, check out our guides to the best women’s and men’s running shoes.

Flat arches : If you have flat arches, your feet tend to overpronate, so you need stability or motion control shoes, says Rebekah Broe , the senior director of product performance for Hoka. (Ed’s note: The inclusion of products sold by Hoka in this article was made independently of Broe.) Stability shoes are best for those with moderately flat feet and motion control shoes are best for more severely flat feet. However, they both help correct misalignment by bringing your feet back into a neutral position. To prevent overpronation and keep the foot aligned, stability and motion control shoes typically have dense, firm foam on the inner side of the midfoot/arch area, a firm heel counter (the stiff part at the back of the shoe) and a wide base, says Sharkey.

High arches : If you have high arches, your feet tend to oversupinate and they don’t absorb shock well, so they need help from extra cushioned shoes that have a somewhat flexible feel, says Broe. A thick layer of foam reduces the impact your body feels every time your feet hit the ground, and it evenly distributes your weight across the shoe to reduce strain, says Sharkey.

A thick layer of foam reduces the impact your body feels every time your feet hit the ground, and it evenly distributes your weight across the shoe to reduce strain, says Sharkey. Neutral arches : If you have neutral arches, your feet pronate and supinate just enough, so your shoes don’t need any specific type of support or correction, says Sharkey. Look for neutral shoes, which keep your feet comfortable and supported rather than impact how they move. These shoes usually have level cushioning, a cushioned sole and a stable base.

Look for neutral shoes, which keep your feet comfortable and supported rather than impact how they move. These shoes usually have level cushioning, a cushioned sole and a stable base. APMA Seal of Acceptance: The American Podiatric Medical Association’s group of podiatrists reviews products like shoes to make sure they promote foot health and meet specific safety and quality standards. If it meets all necessary criteria, a product is given the APMA’s Seal of Acceptance. Experts say APMA-accepted shoes are always a great place to start when shopping since they’re evaluated by a third-party group of doctors.

The running shoes with arch support

To recommend the best running shoes with arch support, I rounded up podiatrists’ and NBC Select staff members’ favorite options. I separated sneakers into three categories — best for flat arches, high arches and neutral arches — and included important information about each one, including weight, material, widths, sizes and heel drop. (Heel drop is the height difference between a shoe’s heel and toe. A higher heel drop means there’s more cushioning in a shoe’s heel than its toe, and a lower heel drop means cushioning is more evenly distributed.)

All the shoes on this list are available in men’s and women’s sizes, and they all come in half and whole sizes. While shopping, you may see brands refer to a shoe’s upper, midsole and outsole. The upper covers the top of your foot, the outsole is the hard material that touches the ground and the midsole connects the upper to the outsole.

Since you won’t know how your feet feel in a pair of sneakers until you try them on, make sure you check a retailer’s return policy before you checkout, says Dr. Priya Parthasarathy, a podiatrist at the Foot & Ankle Specialists of the Mid-Atlantic.

Sharkey says Brooks’ GuideRails System is an effective stabilizing technology, which is exactly what those with flat feet need in a running shoe. It consists of two pieces of foam: a piece on the inside of your heel reduces how much your foot rolls inward, and a piece on the outside of your heel, which is firmer and higher, prevents your foot from shifting outward, according to the brand. These sneakers are made with a medium-thick layer of soft, smooth nitrogen-infused foam, and Brooks says they’re best for road running and walking.

“The Arahi is Hoka’s most supportive sneaker for flat feet,” says Parthasarathy. It’s made with the brand’s H-frame, a firm piece of foam in the midsole (the part of a shoe that connects the upper to the outsole) that’s shaped like the number 8. It runs around the perimeter of the shoe and across the middle to prevent flat feet from overpronating, according to the brand. The Arahi also has a stretchy plush tongue that’s connected to its flat knit upper (the part of a shoe that covers the top of your foot) so it doesn’t move around when you’re running. Its EVA midsole gives it a balanced feel, and its rubber outsole adds grip. Hoka says the sneakers are best for everyday runs and walking.

Hoka’s Gaviota sneaker, which Sharkey recommends, has the same H-frame stabilizing system as the Arahi, but it’s made with a thicker and more plush layer of soft cushioning. The shoe, which is best for everyday runs and walking, is made with a soft, puffy tongue and collar that cradles your ankle. It also has a rocker-shaped outsole that helps you smoothly move through heel-to-toe transitions.

This sneaker is another one of Sharkey’s top picks for runners with flat arches because it’s made with the brand’s Litetruss stabilizing system, which is a lightweight, gel-infused foam that effectively absorbs impact to soften your landings and offers responsive rebound, but it’s not overly cushioned. There’s a soft sockliner on the sneaker’s interior, and it has a padded tongue and collar. The GT-4000 4’s base is wide so your entire foot touches the ground.

The best running shoes for high arches

“The Gel-Nimbus 27s have a ton of cushioning and a ton of comfort in all directions,” says NBC Select reporter Harry Rabinowitz, who has medium-high arches. He likes wearing them for slow runs since they’re “heavy as a boat,” but they keep his feet cozy for miles, so the added weight is worth it. The sneakers’ foam gives them a smooth feel, and they have gel under the heel that absorbs shock and softens your landings, according to the brand. The rubber outsole also has extra grip, which gives you plenty of traction on wet or uneven roads.

If you have high arches but don’t love overly plush sneakers, try the Hoka Cliftons, says Parthasarathy. They’re still highly cushioned, so they effectively absorb shock, but they have firmer EVA foam compared to the Hoka Bondis, giving them a more balanced feel. The shoes’ grippy rubber outsoles have a subtle rocker shape, making your heel-to-toe transitions smooth but not too exaggerated, and reflective details so your feet are visible in low light. Their tongue is also connected to the upper, preventing it from moving around while you’re running. The Clifton 10s are best for everyday runs and walking, according to the brand.

On’s CloudTec cushioning is the most distinct part of the brand’s shoes, and the Cloudmonster has an extra-thick layer of it, which Sharkey recommends for high arches.

The bubbles you see in the midsole compress horizontally and vertically when your feet hit the ground to absorb shock and soften your landings. Then, they expand when you take off to propel you forward. The Cloudmonster is also made with On’s Speedboard, a flexible plastic plate in the midsole that acts as a spring. The shoe’s rocker shape helps you smoothly roll through strides, and it has a soft internal sock liner.

The best running shoes for neutral arches

The Ghost is one of Brooks’ most basic running shoes, and beyond being a reliable daily trainer, I’ve also run 5Ks in them. Rabinowitz is also a fan of these sneakers. “The Ghosts are a go-to recommendation of mine for anyone who wants a comfortable walking or running shoe, but doesn’t know much about sneakers, their feet or their fitness,” he says. “They’re well-balanced for all activities, and have sufficient arch support. Plus, they come in a huge range of sizes and widths.” The sneakers have a medium-thick layer of soft, nitrogen-infused foam, and its midsole works with flexible grooves in the outsole to support your feet through smooth heel-to-toe transitions as you hit the ground and takeoff.

“For most of my recent marathon training, I wore these shoes,” says NBC Select editorial director (and four-time marathoner) Lauren Swanson. “Even with my increased weekly mileage during that training season, I didn’t feel the impact on my knees. If you’ve ever trained for a long distance race, you know how big of a deal that is.” Brooks’ Glycerin sneakers have plush, bouncy, nitrogen-infused foam, and their curved outsole helps you smoothly roll through strides. One of my favorite aspects of this shoe, which I often wear for 10Ks, is its wide base. It makes me feel balanced and stable, especially when going downhill or uphill at a fast pace.

If you’re planning to wear the Glycerins to run long distances, Swanson recommends sizing up. “I lost both of my big toenails during the Chicago Marathon because I was wearing a too-small pair of these,” she says.

I always keep a pair of New Balance Fresh Foams in my closet for 3- to 4-mile recovery runs and long walks. I find them incredibly comfortable thanks to their soft, responsive cushioning, and I appreciate that they have a simple design without any frills like plates or fancy support systems. The Fresh Foams are a basic shoe that I can throw on and practically forget I’m wearing them. They also have a rocker-shaped outsole that makes for seamless heel-to-toe transitions whether I’m running on the road or treadmill.

“I’ve played the field with other sneaker brands, but I keep gravitating toward Saucony’s — it’s something about the lightness and the sole’s spring,” says Swanson. “My favorites are the Saucony Endorphins, but the Guides are a nice, cushiony option for when I need something different.” The shoes, which won an NBC Select Wellness Award, have a broad base, high side walls and foam heel collars that gently hold your feet in place, supporting their natural movement while eliminating excess motion, according to the brand. They have soft foam and a cozy interior sockliner, plus a loop on the back of the heel that helps you pull the shoes onto your feet. The loop is a small yet impactful detail I’m appreciative for.

How to determine your arch type

Visiting a podiatrist is often the best way to determine your arch type, says Parthasarathy, but there are a few methods you can try at home (read about all of them in our guide). The wet footprint test is often the most helpful, says Sharkey. To do it, wet the bottom of one foot, step on a piece of cardboard or colored paper, step off and examine your footprint. Here’s what to look for:

Flat arches : If your whole foot appears in the footprint with little to no curve inward, you have flat or low arches.

: If your whole foot appears in the footprint with little to no curve inward, you have flat or low arches. High arches : If your footprint only shows the heel and ball of your foot with a very narrow or missing section, you have high arches.

: If your footprint only shows the heel and ball of your foot with a very narrow or missing section, you have high arches. Neutral arches: If your footprint has a moderate curve inward with about half of the arch missing from it, you have neutral or medium arches.

Using the wet footprint test, it’s typically easy to identify flat feet, but it can be challenging to distinguish between high and neutral arches, says Parthasarathy. If you try the wet footprint test and are questioning your results, make an appointment with a podiatrist.

Doing the wet footprint test can help you determine your arch type at home, but if you’re unsure about your results, visit a podiatrist. Olivia Ott / NBC News

Frequently asked questions Why is arch support important? Arch support is important because it ensures that your body stays in alignment while you move, says Broe. If your body isn’t in alignment, like when you overpronate or oversupinate, there’s too much pressure and stress on certain parts of your feet, which can lead to injury. Arch support evenly distributes weight across your feet to reduce fatigue, make you more comfortable, increase energy efficiency and improve your overall performance, especially if you’re doing a high-impact activity like running, says Sharkey. How can you tell if a running shoe has arch support? Not all shoes have built-in arch support. And while you need to look for different features depending on your arch type, there are a few ways you can tell whether a sneaker has arch support in general. First and foremost, avoid anything thin or flat. “You should not be able to bend a shoe completely in half like a sandwich,” says Parthasarathy. That’s because shoes with arch support have a midfoot shank, a strip of material that sits between the midsole and outsole, connecting the ball and heel of your foot. The midfoot shank is usually more rigid in shoes for flat arches and more flexible in shoes for high arches, but regardless, it adds structural support and prevents your feet from twisting, says Sharkey. Also look for a deep heel cup, cushioning in the midsole and a removable insole, says Sharkey. When you remove the insole, you should see a raised area in the shoe’s center, and when you press on it, it should feel firm. If you’re shopping online, prioritize shoes that mention “arch support” on their product pages. Can orthotics add arch support to shoes? Orthotics are inserts you add to your shoes, and they’re tailored to your foot shape and specific support needs, says Sharkey. There are generic options available over-the-counter, but to really be effective, you need to visit a podiatrist who can make you a custom set of orthotics. Orthotics can add arch support to shoes, but they can’t make a bad shoe a good one, says Parthasarathy. “Just adding an orthotic to a shoe doesn’t magically make it more supportive,” she says. “The orthotic needs a good foundation.” Because of this, experts recommend focusing on finding the right shoes for your feet, and if you feel like you need even more support, talk to your podiatrist about orthotics. Does everyone need to wear shoes with arch support? “Arch support isn’t a universal need by any means,” says Broe. Those with flat feet, a history of foot pain and previous injuries benefit most from arch support, but many people find that it makes shoes more comfortable, helps prevent injuries and improves how they move, says Sharkey. Whether you need arch support depends on factors like your foot structure, how your feet feel while you do specific activities and underlying foot conditions, so consult your podiatrist if you’re thinking about it. How can you tell if you’re wearing the wrong shoes for your arches? If your feet are uncomfortable or you’re experiencing pain while wearing a pair of shoes, they’re likely not the best option for your arches. “Make sure your sneakers are comfortable right away,” says Parthasarathy. “Some people wait for the shoes to “give” or “work in” to be more comfortable, but if they’re not comfortable when you receive them, they aren’t going to get anymore comfortable, especially as your feet swell the longer you wear them.” That said, it can take time to get used to the feeling of arch support in your sneakers, so try wearing them for two hours a day before your first run in them. But your feet shouldn’t feel overly uncomfortable right away, says Parthasarathy. Other signs that your sneakers aren’t properly supporting your arches include heel slippage, a burning sensation on the bottoms of your feet while running, arch fatigue and arch soreness, says Sharkey. Are stability shoes and arch support shoes the same thing? No, stability shoes and arch support shoes are not the same thing. Stability shoes are specifically designed to correct overpronation associated with flat arches, while arch support shoes can be designed for flat, high or neutral arches, says Sharkey. Overall, all stability shoes have arch support, but not all shoes with arch support are stability shoes. How often should you replace your running shoes? You should replace your running shoes every 300 to 500 miles, or when they feel worn out. “Don’t wear your running shoes until there are holes in them,” says Parthasarathy. “Sometimes your shoes don’t even look worn, but suddenly, you can bend them completely in half. That’s a sign you should change them.”

toggle caption Barry Thumma/AP

We are here — and I mean on the air with you today — because of Susan Stamberg. There are of course others who helped turn the idea of National Public Radio into a distinctive sound. But a little over 50 years ago, when Susan's voice began to crackle into kitchens and cars all over America, the people who heard her didn't ask, ""What's NPR?"" but, ""Who is that?""

She was the first woman to co-host a nightly news broadcast, and she didn't sound like a sonorous news anchor. Susan sounded irreverent, not official. Boisterous, not boring. She was courteous, and often hilarious.

Susan Stamberg gave NPR a voice, and that laugh that could make microphones tremble.

We saluted Susan at NPR — and on this show — when she retired last month. I'm glad she got to hear at least a portion of our gratitude and love before she died this week at the age of 87. Those of us who work here know we stand atop the partnership that Susan and a few other scrappy journalists began more than 50 years ago, with what has become millions of listeners across America.

I've been trying to recount all I learned from Susan over the years.

She often reminded me that the most important thing you can do in an interview is to listen. Journalists often try to plot out extensive questions in advance, packed with pertinent facts. But sometimes we're so eager to get through our questions we neglect to really hear the answers and respond to them.

""You've got to be prepared to let all that prep hit the floor,"" Susan once told me, ""and let the interview go someplace else.""

She also showed us how the best questions can be as short as, ""Why?"" Or as ingenuously simple as when Susan asked an orchestra conductor, ""Don't your arms ever get tired?""

And Susan showed us all that for a news program to become a companion in people's lives, it has to try to play all the notes in the human symphony, high and low; dark and light; and you play them with style. You can pack all the important facts into a story and a show, but if you don't hold the interest of listeners, they won't stay with you long enough to hear any of it.

When NPR was a set of little-known initials, Susan Stamberg gave this place personality.

This summer, we asked you to tell us about the books you read in high school that profoundly affected you. It turns out you had a lot to share. More than 1,100 of you wrote back to tell us about the formative texts you were assigned as teens.

You told us about books that broadened your perspectives and stuck with you as you got older. These dog-eared volumes got packed and unpacked every time you moved homes. They led you to become English majors, librarians, writers, teachers and editors. They inspired tattoos, pet names and baby names. Many of you shouted out the English teachers who, decades ago, pressed these texts into your hands, your heads and your hearts.

We're sharing your thoughts here. This list reflects a time when fewer female authors and writers of color were being published and assigned in high schools — and many of you expressed hope that today's syllabuses are more varied and diverse.

So, at the start of a new school year, with gratitude to English teachers past, present and future, here's what you told us about the books that shaped you.

Readers' responses have been lightly edited for length and clarity.

Two books came up far more often than any of the others:

To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee

Reading about racism from the perspective of a child — 6-year-old narrator Scout Finch in Harper Lee's Pulitzer Prize-winning 1960 novel — was an eye-opening experience for many who responded. Steve Kennebeck, 65, of Ranchos de Taos, N.M., was in seventh grade when his family moved from San Diego to Memphis, Tenn. ""Not long after I arrived, my English teacher, sensing I was having difficulty adjusting, asked how I was doing. … I told her I didn't like the humidity and that I didn't understand why all the Black kids seemed so angry. She reached for the bookshelf and handed me a copy of To Kill a Mockingbird and said: 'Read this — it will help you understand.'"" Christopher Anderson, 60, of Gloucester, Mass., felt such a connection to Scout's lawyer father that he named his first child Atticus. Nathaniel Hardman, 41, of Midvale, Utah, acknowledges: ""I know some object to the 'white savior' narrative. That's fine. Let that be part of the discussion.""

The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger

Holden Caulfield gave voice to the angst and alienation many readers felt in their teen years. His disdain for ""phonies"" resonated with Jennifer Morrison, 56, of Buffalo, N.Y., and she admired the way Holden described his calling — catching kids at the edge of a rye field, just before a cliff. ""Much to my surprise, that's what I ended up doing for my career: I work at colleges, helping students who are failing, or who have failed out, to get back in the game. I love my work, which has never felt like work, and I owe it in part to Holden Caulfield,"" Morrison writes. Gene Kahane, 66, Alameda, Calif., remembers ""getting"" Holden as a teen — and he grew up to become a high school teacher himself. Kahane says now, more than ever, it's ""so powerful, so poignant, so real"" for young people to read stories about characters struggling with mental health. (And PS: Kahane now has a tattoo of a skate key on his forearm. IYKYK.)

""With every passing year, I become more and more alarmed at how quickly our society has begun to mimic the dystopia it depicts,"" Gradowski writes. ""The book shows us how easily a society slips into apathy and contempt for critical thinking. … Our kids need to understand the risks, the price that we pay if we let this sort of world become normalized. … They already live in the early stages of Bradbury's dystopia.

""I never looked at a hot meal the same,"" says Colleen Johnson, 55, of Granbury, Texas. ""I vividly remember finishing a chapter about the starving families traveling to California, then sitting down to eat dinner with my family. I stared at my plate of food, so grateful for what I had."" John Steinbeck's 1939 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about tenant farmers in the Great Depression was a perspective shift for many of our readers. ""Class consciousness, baby,"" writes Eric Garneau, 41, of Chicago. ""That part of Steinbeck's story, although wildly obvious, somewhat glanced off me when I was younger — but, did it? Maybe it just burrowed itself into me, helping to foster empathy for migrants and the exploited even at an age when I could barely articulate what 'privilege' was.""

Johnny Got His Gun by Dalton Trumbo

Dalton Trumbo's 1939 novel about a gravely wounded World War I soldier helped make the tragedy of war less abstract for many readers.

""I couldn't avoid synthesizing the main character's feelings as my own. It was damaging to my psyche but ultimately taught me the idea that everyone has an inner life — sometimes a struggle, sometimes sadness, sometimes elation — and all people have dignity, ally and foe alike.""

Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse

Erin Robertson, 52, of Louisville, Colo., wasn't assigned Siddhartha in school — Robertson was led to the 1922 novel about spiritual discovery by Seventeen magazine. There was an article about ""what book to read to attract/understand each type of boy,"" Robertson recalls. ""One of the types was Ecoboy, and River Phoenix was the example. Yes, please. … My mind was blown — it was my first introduction to Eastern philosophy. ... I felt such relief to find so many of my feelings and beliefs finally put into words. I wasn't wrong — I just believed different things than most of the people around me, and here was someone who believed in them too."" Amy Kilduff, 58, of Brooklyn, Conn., was assigned Siddhartha as a high school senior. The book ""made me question materialism and how 'important' having 'things' actually was for my happiness. … Hesse's stories are all 'journeys of self' and really resonated with me, as a teenager, trying to figure out what truly mattered to me and what I stood for.""

Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl by Anne Frank

Eighty years after Anne Frank died at 15 in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, her teenage diary, which she kept for two years while her family was in hiding from the Nazis, is still an entry point for many students to learn about the Holocaust. ""It's a history lesson from a girl, not a book,"" recalls Therese Gerhauser, 39, of Melbourne, Fla. Patricia Lee Como of San Diego, remembers taking the lessons of the diary to heart: ""My best friend was Jewish and I kept wondering: Would I have helped her? Would I have risked my safety to protect my beautiful friend and her family? I hoped so. I still hope so.""

Beloved by Toni Morrison

Twenty-five years ago, Toni Morrison's words ""jumped off the pages and breathed life into my teenage brain,"" writes Meg Baier, 39, of Brooklyn, N.Y. Beloved, which won the 1988 Pulitzer Prize for fiction, helped many young readers comprehend slavery in a way that went beyond what they were reading in their textbooks. ""I never understood the amount of sorrow this book held until I was much older, but it always gave me a reference point, a place to look when other people talked about their hurt,"" says Kaitlin Macke, 32, of Newcastle, Wyo.

Barbara Haas, 59, of Richmond, Va., remembers being ""floored"" reading The Scarlet Letter, Nathaniel Hawthorne's 1850 novel about a woman in Puritan times punished for having a child out of wedlock. ""I felt as if I was being let in on the secret life of grown-ups. It completely rocked my world,"" Hass writes. ""I'm now a school librarian and live for those moments where I can introduce stories to young people!"" Elizabeth Johnson, 50, of Fort Smith, Ark., says the book tackles themes of hypocrisy and accountability that are still at the forefront for high schoolers today. ""The Scarlet Letter opened my eyes to how quick we, as communities, can be to judge the vulnerable people among us with the obvious 'sins' and take swift action to punish them, while often those in power, who commit 'sins' of equal or even greater impact, often go unseen.""

Many of you wrote in to tell us about how Walden's messages of self-reliance, solitude, critical thinking and appreciation of nature resonated with you in your teen years. Oliver Odenbaugh, 75, of Seymour, Tenn., read Walden as a senior in high school. ""The book revealed to me that there was more to life than sports and girlfriends,"" Odenbaugh writes. ""It awakened a curiosity and a search for my own Walden, and a new thoughtful vocabulary to express my innermost feelings. … For many years afterward, I read Walden annually and never grew tired of examining the thoughts and challenges presented. It wasn't the final destination, but it became the starting point of a life examined and reexamined.""

NBC News Think,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/nba-coach-chauncey-billups-pleads-not-guilty-poker-cheating-case-rcna245687,NBA coach Chauncey Billups pleads not guilty in poker cheating case,"Portland Trail Blazers head coach Chauncey Billups on Monday pleaded not guilty to a two-count federal indictment accusing him of participating in a brazen scheme to rig underground poker games backed by the Mafia.

Billups is charged with wire fraud conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy.

Judge Ramon Reyes set bond at $5 million, secured by Billups’ home in Greenwood Village, Colorado. The conditions of his bond package dictate that he cannot have contact with witnesses, victims, co-conspirators or co-defendants.

He also cannot gamble or associate with any members of organized crime.

Billups was surrounded by reporters and cameras as he left the federal courthouse Monday alongside his attorney, his wife and one of his daughters.

The arraignment was followed by a status conference for 31 of his co-defendants in the alleged cheating case, dubbed “Operation Royal Flush” by federal investigators.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Gibaldi told the court that his office has already started plea discussions with several of the defendants.

The government continues to collect materials from the defendants, including documents, photos, records from searches, cell phone content and iCloud information that totals one terabyte of data.

The case is so sprawling that prosecutors suggested breaking it up into three groups of defendants — but several defense attorneys immediately shot down that proposal. Reyes, for his part, said he wants the defendants to be tried together for now.

Reyes also dismissed defense attorneys’ suggestion that the complex case could take years to go through the legal system, saying he wants to move it along and begin the trial by next September. He told the room of attorneys to “do what you have to do.”

The defendants are accused of participating in a scheme to rig ritzy card games in Manhattan, Las Vegas, Miami and the Hamptons. The suspects allegedly used high-tech cheating gadgets to steal millions of dollars from games backed by four of the Mafia’s “Five Families.”

Billups, a former NBA player and 2004 NBA Finals MVP, allegedly played the role of “Face Card” — a high-profile person who could help attract big-fish gamblers. He was arrested on Oct. 23.

The NBA put Billups on immediate leave after the charges were announced. “We take these allegations with the utmost seriousness, and the integrity of our game remains our top priority,” the league said in a statement.

Billips has not coached since Oct. 22, the night before he was indicted.

NBC News Think,https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/what-to-buy-skip-black-friday-cyber-monday-2025-rcna244343,"What to Buy & Skip During Black Friday 2025, According to Experts","Black Friday and Cyber Monday aren’t sprints anymore; they’ve fused together into a shopping marathon. Instead of one day for in-store deals and another for online promos, retailers now host weeks-long events, prompting experts to coin the term Black November (which feels much more accurate, if you ask me).

More time to shop is beneficial — you can spread out spending, carefully compare deals and buy popular products before they sell out. But it also means you need to strategize beyond making a mental wishlist. It’s easy to get overwhelmed by the hundreds of sales out there, and the last thing you want to do is impulse buy or overspend, especially if tariffs shrank your budget this year.

To help you make a Black Friday and Cyber Monday game plan, I put together this guide filled with tips and tricks I swear by after covering the sales for over five years. I also talked to experts to get their advice about what to buy, what to skip and how to save the most. I’ll frequently update this article throughout the next two weeks.

Head’s up: Black Friday and Cyber Monday will be different this year

Before I get into the nitty-gritty, there are two important things to know about Black Friday and Cyber Monday this year:

Deals won’t be as fantastic as usual, but they’re still worthwhile.

Believe me, this is not the news I wanted to hear either. But tariffs are impacting Black Friday and Cyber Monday, and it’s important to understand how so you can manage your expectations and strategize appropriately.

Here’s the deal: To avoid drastically increasing prices for customers, most retailers are currently partially absorbing tariff costs, which limits how much they can afford to discount products and still make a profit. “Retailers will still give us Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals, but less of them, and discounts won’t be as deep,” says Erik Guzik, an assistant clinical professor of management and entrepreneurship at the University of Montana College of Business. “In the past, we may have expected a 40% to 50% discount, but this year, 20% to 30% may be what we need to consider quite good, especially in areas that have been targeted by tariffs, like clothing, footwear, toys and electronics.”

That doesn’t mean deals aren’t worth shopping. They absolutely are, especially since experts expect consumer goods prices to increase in 2026. “Any discount at this point is positive,” says Guzik. Most retailers overstocked their warehouses before the new tariff policy took effect to avoid increased duties, but once that inventory is gone, they’ll have to import items and pay higher tariff rates, giving them no choice but to increase products’ prices in most cases, says Guzik.

If you don’t shop early, you’re doing it wrong.

All the experts I talked to have one main piece of advice for shoppers: hurry. Because retailers are discounting products during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, while partially absorbing the cost of tariffs, their profit margins are quite low. That will probably cause them to limit product quantities, like only putting 500 models of a certain TV on sale rather than 1,000, which means you’ll see items go out-of-stock quicker than usual, says Ronald Goodstein, an associate professor of marketing at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business.

The overall takeaway? “Once you see that discount, it’s probably the best one we’re getting this holiday season,” says Guzik. “Waiting to see if deals get better, which likely won’t be the case, is more risky than ever. Shop early, because once an item goes out of stock, it probably won’t come back.”

What to shop during Black Friday and Cyber Monday

Tariffs are making them less flashy than usual, but Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales still offer the deepest discounts across the biggest selection of products all year. That means (almost) everything on your wishlist will likely be on sale. The best deals, however, tend to fall within four categories: tech, toys, small home and kitchen appliances, and subscriptions and experiences. “These are the categories where retailers go big early, and prices are already strong,” says Stephanie Carls, a retail insights expert at RetailMeNot. Below, I break down what to look for in each category and examples of popular products I expect to be on sale — some early deals are already live.

Tech

There’s no better time of year to buy tech than Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Most brands drop prices on TVs, laptops, video game consoles, headphones, speakers, smart home products, smartwatches and more by about 30 to 50%, says Ashley Feinstein Gerstley, a shopping and savings strategist at Rakuten, and you’ll find lots of tech listed at its lowest price ever.

If you’re specifically in the market for video game consoles, there’s no shortage of deals during Black Friday and Cyber Monday from top brands like Nintendo and PlayStation. And beyond discounts on individual consoles, controllers and games, brands usually sell exclusive bundles as some of their best offers of the year. Our team is always waiting for the Nintendo Switch bundle to drop around Black Friday, for example. Last year, it came with the original Nintendo Switch, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and a 12-month subscription to Nintendo Switch Online for $299.98 — that’s $79.99 less than if you bought each item separately. This year, we’re eyeing Nintendo Switch 2 bundles like the Nintendo Switch 2 + Pokémon Legends: Z-A Bundle.

Toys

Toys are among the most competitive categories during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, both in terms of discounts and demand. The most popular toys sell out quickly (I’m talking a couple of hours, maximum), so once you see prices drop, buy your must-haves immediately. Legos, Barbies, Hot Wheels, Hasbro board games, Tamagotchis — they’ll be on sale and they’ll go fast.

Small home and kitchen appliances

Almost every small home and kitchen appliance you can think of gets discounted this month, so now is the time to buy that Vitamix blender or Dyson vacuum you’re dreaming about. In addition to items you use year-round, keep an eye on seasonal appliances, like space heaters and snow blowers, as well as tableware, home decor and other essentials you’ll need to host guests during the holidays, says Gerstley.

Subscriptions and experiences

Tangible products aren’t the only things discounted on Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Almost every company that sells something hops on the bandwagon, and in recent years, we’ve seen discounts on subscriptions to TV, music and educational platforms. In 2024, for example, you could get a year-long Hulu subscription for $0.99 per month (normally $9.99 a month) and an annual MasterClass subscription for 50% off. There are deals on experiences, too, like travel packages, fitness classes and spa treatments, especially at local businesses in your area.

What not to shop during Black Friday and Cyber Monday

If you’re trying to narrow down your shopping list, Carls recommends waiting to buy everyday apparel (especially cold-weather pieces), beauty products and furniture. “Those tend to drop more in December when stores start clearing inventory,” she says. You can skip mattresses, too, as well as large home and kitchen appliances — discounts tend to be just as good around President’s Day.

Expert shopping tips: Black Friday and Cyber Monday do’s and don’ts

As I mentioned above, Black Friday and Cyber Monday aren’t spirits anymore; they’re a shopping marathon. Those who plan for it will save the most, so to help you strategize, I rounded up a list of dos and don’ts based on my 5+ years of experience covering sales, as well as experts’ advice.

Don’t: Skip early deals

It bears repeating because it’s that important this year: “If it’s a good price and the exact model you want, grab it,” says Carls. Limited inventories and products going out of stock are certainties, not predictions, so it’s better to buy now than panic later. 73% of consumers plan to start holiday shopping before Cyber Week, according to RetailMeNot — if you're in the minority, I suggest rethinking your strategy.

Do: Make a shopping list

Making a mental shopping list isn’t nearly as useful as writing it down, whether on paper or your phone’s notes app. Some retailers also let you create wishlists on their websites or curate a cart and save it for later. Referring to your shopping list helps you hold yourself accountable for buying what you actually need rather than filling your cart with impulse purchases.

Once you’ve nailed down your list, rank order it, says Henry Jin, a professor of supply chain management at Miami University’s Farmer School of Business. “You’re only saving money if you’re paying less for things you’ve always wanted or really need,” he says. “Rank order your wish list based on the greatest need, and recognize that the items on the bottom of that list may be aspirational purchases you can delay for now.”

Do: Set a budget

Think about the grand total you’re comfortable spending this season, factoring in costs like gifts (for yourself and others), travel, hosting expenses, gift wrapping supplies and shipping fees, says Gerstley. Put a chunk of that aside for Black Friday and Cyber Monday, and build in what Gerstley calls a “fun buffer” to give you room for a spontaneous splurge or two without feeling stressed. Also, before shopping for holiday gifts, talk to your loved ones about budgets beforehand so everyone is on the same page.

Do: Get cozy with your favorite retailers

Sign up for your favorite brands’ email newsletters, SMS lists and push app alerts, and follow them on social media. Companies often use these channels to update shoppers about flash sales, limited-edition drops, new deals and extra promos you might be able to stack on top of the discount.

Do: Stack savings

Retailers likely aren’t slashing prices as much as they have in years past, but stacking savings can take a deal from good to great. On top of getting the discount, paying with a credit card that lets you earn points as you spend, downloading cashback extensions, adding extra promo codes and coupons and shopping on websites with free shipping are all ways to put money back in your pocket, says Carls.

Don’t: Ignore shipping fees and where products ship from

No one wants to pay for shipping, but if you’re shopping online, you’re at the mercy of the retailer, says Jin. Shipping fees can drive up the price of your purchase, so try to avoid them if you can. One of the best ways to do so is buying online and picking up in-store, and doing the bulk of your shopping at retailers whose loyalty programs you’re part of, like Amazon Prime, Walmart+ and Target Circle, all of which offer free shipping as a perk.

During Black Friday and Cyber Monday, some retailers also offer free shipping if you spend a certain amount, so look out for those offers. But be aware that the minimum order required to unlock free shipping might be higher than you’re used to due to tariffs. “A way for retailers to absorb some of the higher expenses is to require customers to spend more in order to qualify for free shipping,” says Jin.

Also, pay attention to where products ship from before you check out. Sometimes retailers don’t disclose that information, but if they do, and your products are shipping from outside the U.S., you may have to pay additional tariffs since the de minimis exception ended this summer. Experts also recommend only shopping from retailers you’re familiar with — buying from those you’re unfamiliar with means there’s a greater chance for surprises to pop up. And since you don’t have experience with them, you won’t be able to recognize red flags, like exorbitant shipping fees.

Do: Comparison shop

During major sale events, retailers usually sell the same products for the exact (or almost exact) same prices, a practice called price chasing. In these cases, deciding where to buy comes down to the details. Compare shipping fees, stackable promo codes and coupons, cashback offers, return policies, extended warranties and reward points you might be eligible for. You can also set up price drop alerts through certain retailers’ websites, like Amazon, or through tools like Keepa, CamelCamelCamel and Honey, so you’ll immediately know if any brands discount an item more than you expected them to. Comparison shopping helps you “cherry pick” deals so you get the absolute lowest price on each item, rather than blindly doing all your shopping at one place and potentially sacrificing savings, says Goodstein.

Do: Track prices

Retailers sometimes raise prices prior to major sales like Black Friday and Cyber Monday, and at NBC Select, we follow specific criteria to evaluate deals before recommending them. We use price trackers like CamelCamelCamel, Honey and Keepa to evaluate an item’s price history and determine if it’s actually a good deal or just temporarily marked down from an inflated baseline. You can use these sites to track prices, too.

Don’t: Forget to read return and price matching polices

Most retailers let you return Black Friday and Cyber Monday purchases within a certain timeframe, and some even offer an extended return policy around the holidays. Make sure you actually read retailers’ return policies so you know when you’ll have to send something back by, if needed — no one wants to get stuck with a product they don’t want.

Also, research what retailers have return policies, especially since shopping early is so important this year. If an item drops in price within the two weeks after you buy it, for example, some retailers will honor the lower price and refund you the difference, says Goodstein.

Frequently asked questions When do Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales start? Black Friday is on Nov. 28, 2025, and Cyber Monday is on Dec. 1, 2025. Some deals are already live, and by the week before Black Friday, most will be in full swing. When do Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales end? The strongest sales end on Cyber Monday, but since many people shop for holiday gifts through mid-December, retailers continue to offer discounts. That said, they’re typically weaker compared to those during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, and there’s a smaller volume of deals, so you have fewer options to choose from. Is there a difference between Black Friday and Cyber Monday anymore? No, there’s not a difference between Black Friday and Cyber Monday anymore, says Goodstein. The line between them has completely blurred since they’re no longer separate, one-day events, where one focuses on in-store deals and the other on online deals. They’ve morphed into a weeks-long savings period experts call Black November, during which you can shop online and in stores for any product imaginable. At this point, the main difference between Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals is the terminology retailers use. They usually use “Black Friday” language now through the Saturday after the shopping holiday, and swap to “Cyber Monday” language by Sunday. Otherwise, the majority of discounts and the product selection remain completely identical. Are there better deals on Cyber Monday? There are usually no better deals on Cyber Monday. Sales tend to mirror Black Friday, though retailers may add a few new limited-time promotions to their assortments. Overall, it’s best to think of Cyber Monday as your absolute last chance to shop. Should you shop in-store or online during Black Friday? There are pros and cons to shopping in-store and online during Black Friday. Consider these factors while making your decision: Online shopping is more convenient than in-store shopping, and it’s easier to compare prices across sites. Retailers also offer a wider variety of discounts online. Retailers want to make in-store shopping a special experience for customers on Black Friday, so they may offer exclusive deals and gifts with purchase at their locations. Shopping in-store lets you try on and touch items, and take them home that day. You’ll likely have to pay shipping fees if you shop online, but you can avoid them by shopping in person. To get the best of both worlds, buy online and pick up in-store when possible. What is Travel Tuesday? Travel Tuesday is dedicated to deals on flights, hotels and cruises, but brands also host sales on related products like suitcases and toiletry bags. Travel Tuesday falls on the day after Cyber Monday, so this year it’s on Dec. 2.

It has been more than a month since a “ceasefire” took hold in Gaza. That, of course, does not mean that the killing of Palestinians has stopped. It simply means that it has been reduced to a rate that allows international media to ignore it.

And so, the world has largely moved on from the story. But I haven’t.

In July 2024, I joined a medical mission to Gaza and spent 22 days there, volunteering at hospitals. What I came back with is something I cannot easily explain.

The man my family knew, the son, brother, and husband they laughed with, the father who played with his children, feels lost to them now.

I call him the “previous Talal”.

My children, wife, siblings, parents, friends and colleagues, they all see the change. They tell me I have become distant, quiet, detached, and sometimes hard to reach. My emotions are messy and raw in ways words often fail to capture. It is not a single feeling, but a swarm of emotions that is not going away despite the news of a “ceasefire” and reassurances of “reconstruction”.

After witnessing human tragedy of indescribable proportions, I still feel anger bubbling at the injustice of it all, guilt for leaving behind the vulnerable, and a constant, aching helplessness at not being able to do something to stop this continuing annihilation.

I still feel uneasy when I see a lavish buffet meal on a table in front of me, knowing people continue to starve in Gaza.

The faces and scenes I have witnessed continue playing like a never-ending movie in my head: Starving children reduced to skeletons, parents who held onto body parts of their beloved children, completely charred humans, cozy blankets used as shrouds for human body parts, a bombed hospital, levelled buildings emitting the odour of decomposing bodies buried in their rubble.

I am still haunted by the choices I had to make: which patient to treat because there were not enough dialysis machines, or what words to use to explain to a child why their parent will not wake up.

Gaza has transformed me from a nephrologist to a journalist, storyteller, and humanitarian. Since I came back, I have written articles, spoken at mosques and universities, led talks at fundraisers, stood at marches, and met lawmakers, advocating for the oppressed people of Gaza in every way I can. Just like other colleagues who have been on medical missions to the Gaza Strip, I have tried to turn bearing witness into action so that Gaza is not forgotten.

I have tried to go back several times. Each time, Israel has denied me entry. Each denial has made my heart ache worse.

The distance between what I can do here and what is needed there feels unbearable. I constantly ask myself, “Am I doing enough? Have I failed?”

Is this sadness? Trauma? A conscience that refuses to be at peace? I do not know the proper label, and labels do not lessen the load.

What I do know is this: Gaza changed me in a way that cannot be undone, and to pretend otherwise would be a betrayal of what I saw and of the people I met.

The previous Talal is lost, but this new Talal is more humane, kind, compassionate, more realistic, more courageous and vocal, driven by the resilience and faith of the people of Gaza.

No medical training could prepare me to maintain a “life-genocide balance”.

Still, the despair and pain I carry now are only a pinch of what the Palestinians have endured day after day, for more than two years now. They have experienced unimaginable horrors, torture, starvation, injury and death.

If you read my story, please read not to offer sympathy but to remember: The genocide in Gaza is not over, and the besieged people of Gaza are still suffering. Behind every statistic in Gaza, there are human souls, ambitions, hopes and dignity.

The ceasefire is a temporary relief from the mass bombardment; true peace will come only when the occupation ends and justice is served.

As I share my emotions and experiences in Gaza, I am also heartbroken about what is happening in Sudan. It feels like watching a tragic replay of suffering and loss, human devastation livestreamed every day.

What troubles me even more is how easily the world seems to be getting used to it. This realisation is harrowing. Human civilisation has achieved so much in terms of progress and development, yet we seem to be regressing when it comes to compassion and humanity.

I write these words to call on people to take action.

To my fellow healthcare workers and humanitarians who have volunteered in Gaza, I say: we cannot let the world turn its back. We must not stop speaking about what we witnessed and what continues to happen in Gaza. We must continue to inform, rally and insist that full humanitarian and medical access to Gaza is granted.

To my fellow Americans, I say, we bear responsibility for what is happening in Gaza. Our country is directly involved in it, our taxpayers’ money is funding it. Do not stay silent because of intimidation. Speak, write, post and talk about it in your communities. Call your lawmakers. Do not allow the mass bombardment, torture and starvation of another people to be normalised.

And to all people of the world who still believe in the possibility of a free and just world, I say: the responsibility is ours to make sure it is. We have witnessed a livestreamed genocide, one of the greatest moral tests of our time. So do not fall into silence. Rise. Refuse to let a temporary ceasefire in Gaza or a protracted war in Sudan become a curtain that hides the genocidal reality. Keep insisting on an end to the violence, for the dignity of every human life.

Let us be the force that helps Gaza and Sudan heal, rebuild and remember, so that “never again” becomes “never again for all”!

The game was not even a quarter-hour old and Everton had already been forced into a substitution when Seamus Coleman suffered an injury requiring the introduction of Jake O’Brien.

Man United had the better of play and some poor communication between the Toffees allowed a Bryan Mbeumo penalty shout and then a dangerous shot from Bruno Fernandes.

Something in that sequence enraged Gana Gueye, who approached a perturbed Michael Keane with vigor. Keane shoved Gana Gueye back up field, and that found a new boiling point as Gana Gueye used his left hand to slap Keane in the jaw.

Gana Gueye was held back from reaching either Keane or the referee by Iliman Ndiaye and Jordan Pickford. It isn’t quite Newcastle United’s Lee Bowyer and Kieron Dyer exchanging blows and being separated by Aston Villa players, but it’s familiar enough.

Now the midfield will miss three games.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/24/parent-whatsapp-groups-hell#comments,"Sure, people tell you about sleepless nights. But why does no one mention the hell that is a parent WhatsApp group? | Sean Szeps","When I was little, I thought hell was a fiery pit beneath the Earth’s surface. The image was vivid: flames, tortured souls and a cartoonish devil with a pitchfork.

Now that I’m an adult, I know better. Hell is actually a parent WhatsApp group.

The parent WhatsApp group – known colloquially as Satan’s Slack channel – is one of those parenting surprises no one warns you about. People tell you about the sleepless nights, the lost identity and the toys that reproduce overnight. But no one says: “You’ll one day discuss nits with 30 adults as though global peace depends on it.”

What began as a simple way to share school updates has mutated into a relentless stream of chatter. There are simply too many messages. You wake up to messages, you go to sleep to messages, you duck into a meeting and come back to 64 unread notes about sunscreen. Linda has posted the same information seven times because she doesn’t trust anyone to read it. Which, to be fair, is accurate.

When I was growing up my parents got information the old-fashioned way: crumpled notes in backpacks and gossip at pickup. They weren’t part of a digital micro-community of helicopter-adjacent strangers debating uniform policy. They didn’t refresh their phones at 9.38pm to discover that it’s going to be Harmony Day and every child needs to wear “something representing their heritage”.

My parents didn’t live in constant communication with other parents. They weren’t expected to be this connected, worrying about real-time reminders. And maybe, I’m going out on a limb here, that distance was healthy.

I don’t say this lightly … I think WhatsApp is ruining parenting.

I don’t think it’s evil, per se. In fact, it’s one of my favourite apps for keeping in touch with friends abroad. But the problem is: it’s always on. School parenting used to happen at drop-off, pickup and during homework battles at the dinner table. Now it happens first thing in the morning in bed, 11 minutes later in the bathroom and while sprinting through Kmart before school to find a T-shirt that screams “my child is Cuban-Italian”.

There’s no off switch. Go offline for an hour and suddenly everyone else knows that swimming starts this week, not next, that the assembly has been moved (again), and that Sharon’s selling year 1 tea towels for charity and you were supposed to submit your child’s portrait last Tuesday.

These groups are built for people who are permanently available and find deep meaning in the phrase “quick reminder”. They are not built for me. Or anyone with boundaries. Or a child.

Here’s the hypocrisy of it all: we limit our kids’ screen time, tell them to be present and post quotes about how “childhood is a short season” to our 600 Instagram followers. Then we feel pressured to check our WhatsApp 16 times a day, watching the theatre of parenting confusion unfold in real time.

And it is theatre. The WhatsApp group act is part coordination, part performance. Every “thanks for the reminder” is less about gratitude and more about signalling: “I’m a good parent too, I swear.” Even if I forgot the bake sale once. Or twice. Fine, three times.

I’m worried it’s making us all a bit dumber. Because if the information lives in the group, we stop paying real attention. We rely on the collective brain, on someone else (probably Linda) to notice, remind and repost. It’s the parenting equivalent of a get-out-of-jail-free card. Maybe things would be simpler if our only option was talking to people in public.

The worst part? I’ve become complicit. I can’t quit. Somewhere along the way, I volunteered to be the WhatsApp rep for my daughter’s class. I haven’t slept properly since.

I used to worry about my heart health. Now I worry I’ll die suddenly and come back as the eternal moderator of every year 2 WhatsApp group, trapped forever between reminding people about permission slips and guilt-tripping them about class fundraisers.

All I want is a note in the backpack or a quick chat at pickup. I’m craving an actual conversation with a teacher instead of ignoring her because I’ve already checked WhatsApp four times between leaving my car and getting to the gate.

I want a little space back. A crack in the digital noise. I miss the quiet confidence of not knowing everything all the time. The small mystery of what happens to my kids between drop-off and pickup. The trust that things will be fine, even if I’m not across every single message.

Maybe that’s the real lesson of modern parenting? Not to be more connected but to remember that it’s OK to step back. That missing something isn’t failing. It’s freedom.",2025-11-24 00:00:00,literal,Straightforward news about policy,literal,literal,0,literal,0.65774196,0.342258,0.65774196,True

Some honored veterans will soon be let out to pasture. The U.S. Army has announced plans to dramatically scale back its Military Working Equid program. 141 of the 236 horses, donkeys, and mules who work for the U.S. military, mostly in ceremonial processions, are being put up for adoption.

Those four-legged troopers ""are part of the Army family,"" Army spokesperson Steve Warren told reporters. ""We're going to treat them with compassion.""

U.S. Army horses have not been deployed in combat since the 26th Cavalry Regiment led a mounted charge in the Battle of Bataan in 1942. (A dozen Green Berets did ride on horseback during the war in Afghanistan, but they were supplied by their Afghan allies, the Northern Alliance.)

Yet a horse who serves their country is no less vital when their service is mostly ceremonial — in parades, honor guards, and funerals.

""The horses were never just horses,"" Captain Lydia Laga, a public affairs officer for the 3rd Combat Aviation Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division, wrote in The Military Times. ""They were part of a living, breathing connection to American military heritage, bridges to a time when thundering hooves marked both ceremony and strategy... a piece of Army culture that stood defiantly in contrast to the digital age.""

I have been to military funerals at Arlington National Cemetery, sometimes as a reporter, sometimes as a mourner. There is something extraordinary and eloquent in seeing horses pull the caisson that bears the casket of a fallen soldier, under the folds of the stars and stripes.

The clop of the horse's hooves is a kind of muted drumroll. The horses, so beautifully trained, are elegant and stately.

Their presence seems a symbol. Soldiers may serve at different ranks, and over different decades. But whether the deceased was a four-star general, or long-retired infantryman who came under fire in battles long ago, the U.S. Army, and the American people, memorialize their service with the same respect and ritual: Army horses bring them to a final rest.

Paring back the Working Equid program should save the Army about $2 million a year — out of an annual budget of more than $185 billion. But they will continue to keep ceremonial animals at Arlington National Cemetery and Joint Base San Antonio.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/nov/24/hip-hop-the-last-poets,"Hip-hop godfathers the Last Poets: ‘In times of great chaos, there’s opportunity’","For the first time in 35 years, Billboard’s Hot 100 chart does not include a rap song among its top 40 hit records. Anyone who’s been listening to the music for at least that long can list myriad reasons why that’s now the case: all the beats sound the same, all the artists are industry plants, all the lyrics are barely intelligible etc. For hip-hop forefather Abiodun Oyewole, though, it boils down to this: “We embraced ‘party and bullshit’, my brother.”

Fifty-seven years ago, on what would have been Malcolm X’s 43rd birthday, Oyewole cliqued up with two young poets at a writers’ workshop in East Harlem’s Mount Morris Park (now Marcus Garvey Park) to form what would become the Last Poets, a collective of bard revolutionaries. They outfitted themselves in African prints, performed over the beat of a congo drum and advocated for populism in their verses. The group has had many configurations over the years, but Oyewole, Jalal Mansur Nuriddin and Umar Bin Hassan abide as the standout members. The trio is all over the band’s self-titled first album – which was released in 1970 and peaked at No 29 on the Billboard 200. Their follow-up album, This Is Madness, made them ripe targets for J Edgar Hoover’s Cointelpro campaign against the emerging figures the then-FBI director deemed politically subversive. Notably, Oyewole could not contribute to that album because he had been incarcerated for an attempted robbery of a Ku Klux Klan headquarters, serving two and a half years of a three-year sentence. (He was trying to raise bail for activists who had been arrested for striking back at the Klan.)

Though dubbed “jazz poetry” at the time, the Last Poets’ tight rhythms, insurgent message and prevailing emphasis on Black consciousness would lay the foundation (along with fellow beatniks Gary Byrd and Gil Scott-Heron) for hip-hop music. Everyone from Melle Mel to KRS One to Common has paid some kind of homage to the Last Poets in their work. Oyewole’s “party and bullshit” line, which came from the song When the Revolution Comes on the Last Poets’ first album, would become the title and hook for the Notorious BIG’s debut single. Black comedians pay tribute to the Last Poets too with every one of their spoken word slam parodies.

Late last year, the Last Poets released an 11th studio album, Africanism, without Nuriddin (who died from cancer in 2018) that takes the some of group’s most resonant poems and sets them to the Afrobeat stylings of the late, great Tony Allen – the genre pioneer who came to prominence directing Fela Kuti’s band. “I’m blown away by the fact that Umar and I both said things that are extremely relevant today,” Oyewole says. “It’s so weird that these problems continue to exist.”

At age 77, Oyewole remains as attuned to the big issues as ever. With Bin Hassan, also 77, looking on (his speech has been somewhat limited after he suffered a pair of strokes in the last few years), Oyewole let his opinions fly over the course of our hourlong interview.

On Zohran Mamdani, a former wannabe emcee turned Democratic socialist, sweeping to victory in New York City’s mayoral election, Oyewole says: “This is all in divine order.”

On the escalation of political violence in Nigeria, a thorny issue Nicki Minaj clumsily waded into during a surprise recent appearance at the UN, Oyewole says: “We need to recognize that we are one and the same people, Africa and the diaspora, and make that union a lot tighter.”

On the fall of Kanye West, who is featured with Oyewole on the Common song The Corner: “Kanye got hooked on the bitches brew. He got stuck, strung out. I don’t know if you’ve seen Sinners, but Kanye West has been bitten.”

After Martin Luther King’s assassination in 1968, Oyewole says, “I wanted to become a serial killer.” In fact, some of those bitter feelings bubble back to the surface when Oyewole segues to the topic of Charlie Kirk’s death and rightwing efforts to recast Kirk as a civil rights martyr. “It’s embarrassing to have all the flags flying half mast in honor of a racist,” he says, “of someone who insulted every Black woman when he said Maxine Waters, Michelle Obama and Ketanji Brown Jackson weren’t smart. It’s embarrassing that Black people would say: ‘Well, I feel sorry for him.’ There’s nothing to feel sorry for.”

Oyewole credits Last Poets co-founder David Nelson for challenging him to express that rage in couplets instead. Earlier this month, while performing on the Soul Train cruise with a lineup that also included the Isley Brothers, Oyewole told guitarist Ernie Isley that their hit song It’s Your Thing inspired the first poem he ever wrote, What’s Your Thing, Brother? – a greeting that Oyewole heard often in the 1960s among activist-minded Black New Yorkers trying to suss out one another’s political bents. You better get a thing before you lose everything, the poem goes.

The Last Poets’ grounding in Black pride and political purpose became heirlooms that were carried forward in the hip-hop movement – that critical last word intended as much to rally listeners to the dancefloor as join them in common cause against political oppression. It’s a conjoining of ideals that began in earnest with Grandmaster Flash & the Furious Five’s breakout The Message, which sets the story of the Bronx’s 1980s-era crime and dereliction to synth rhythms and breakbeats. Over the decades, rap’s practitioners have dutifully upheld the Black American oral tradition of fighting the power and passing down knowledge of self while also serving up plenty of dancefloor hits. Even Biggie followed up Party & Bullshit on his debut album with Things Done Changed, a reflection on the harsh realities of his Bedford-Stuyvesant Brooklyn community.

But Oyewole doesn’t hear that same range of awareness or sense of urgency in hip-hop that is being pushed by the music industry today. “Our music has always been a reflection of our living,” he says, “but we’re dying spiritually.” To underscore his point, he references to an early poem of Bin Hassan’s that was revived for Africanism called Niggers Are Scared of Revolution – a flash of recognition that perked up his bandmate. “I was a shoeshine boy, going to bars and everything,” Bin Hassan says, “listening to people talk about who they are, from gang members to masters of the world. I had to take the language.”

The poem was meant to be a criticism on the N-word’s repurposing into a term of endearment – but that message backfired as hip-hop effectively sold its soul to secure its prime position in pop culture. “They even changed the feature character from cat to dog,” Oyewole says. “Back in the day when I was growing up, it was: ‘Man, that cat can play the piano’ or ‘That’s a cool cat.’ But now it’s: ‘Yo dog, that’s my dawg … ’

“No, I am not your dog.”

Hip-hop’s outsized role in making the language of Black disparagement more palatable, Oyewole further argues, has only made it easier for Donald Trump (whom he calls “the Taco Man”) and his white supremacist acolytes in government to deny Black excellence in their policy-driven attacks against critical race theory and DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion). Nevertheless, Oyewole is confident and remains hopeful that those efforts will backfire too, and that the Last Poets’ mission of returning the power to the people will ultimately win out.

“In times of great chaos, there’s opportunity,” he says. “The Taco Man and his efforts to ban books and erase our history? All he’s really doing, in a weird way, is promoting us. But he doesn’t realize that because he’s not smart.”",2025-11-24 00:00:00,metaphor,Slams used as metaphor for strong criticism; backfires for plan failing,metaphor,figurative,1,figurative,0.34709936,0.6529006,0.6529006,True

""Some like to think we're a winning combination,"" says Boston Weatherford. ""Of course, it's all because of me,"" she laughs, but Morrison quickly agrees. ""Of course, of course,"" he says. ""You always keep me on my game.""

Their first children's book together was 2019's The Roots of Rap. They were paired up because of Morrison's background in the hip-hop industry. ""I started hip-hop dancing and then I started club dancing,"" he explains. This was back in the 1980s, and he went on tour to Europe. ""That was a big part of my life and it kind of changed my scope on art as well,"" Morrison says, ""because I had a chance to go to the Louvre while I was out there… looking at the 'Mona Lisa,' you think, 'Oh, I thought it'd be bigger,' but my gosh, it's beautiful.""

Now, Frank Morrison and Carole Boston Weatherford have finished their sixth book together. In Family Feast!, the day begins early for Big Ma and Pops, who spend the morning peeling fruit for a pie and dressing the fish to fry. When aunts, uncles, cousins, sisters and brothers arrive, everyone gathers in the kitchen to cook, share recipes, gossip, catch up, shoot the breeze and lick the bowls. Boston Weatherford says that everyone brings something different to the party, ""whether it's a dish or, you know, somebody got to be the joke master or the storyteller.""

And even though there's a turkey on the table, this book could be about Thanksgiving, Christmas, Easter or even any old weekend. ""It kind of shows the conversation, the chaos and the culinary creations that come out of these family feasts,"" she says.

Frank Morrison says his relatives used to gather for feasts just like this one every Sunday. ""I felt like I was reading what happened over the weekend with my family,"" he adds.

Morrison illustrated the book in warm, earthy, autumnal colors. ""It kind of looks like the leaves on the tree,"" he explains. ""I just want it to feel warm [like] when you come into the house after a cold night.""

Sen. Pauline Hanson appeared in the burqa, a full-face covering worn by some Muslim women, after she was denied permission to introduce a bill that would ban them in public.

Lawmakers erupted in anger as Hanson entered the chamber, and Senate proceedings were suspended when she refused to remove the garment.

“This is a racist senator displaying blatant racism and Islamophobia,” said Mehreen Faruqi, a Muslim senator from the state of New South Wales.

Another senator of the faith, Fatima Payman of Western Australia, said it was “disgraceful.”

“She is disrespecting the Muslims out there, Muslim Australians. It’s absolutely unconstitutional,” Payman said.

This is the second time Hanson, who represents the state of Queensland, has worn a burqa in Parliament, having done so previously in 2017 when she called for a nationwide ban.

Her stunt came amid growing support in Australia for anti-immigration policies and rhetoric, with her One Nation party doubling itself to four seats in May’s election.

Hanson’s actions drew rebuke from across the political spectrum, including both opposition and government leaders.

“Whatever our own beliefs may be, the sort of disrespect that you’re engaging in now is not worthy of a member of the Australian Senate,” said Penny Wong, the leader of Australia’s center-left Labor government in the Senate.

Hanson later said on Facebook that she wore the burqa to protest her bill’s not being introduced, “so that every Australian knows what’s at stake.”

Al Jazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/11/17/why-many-bosnian-genocide-scholars-remain-silent-on-gaza,Why many Bosnian genocide scholars remain silent on Gaza,"This year marks three decades since the end of the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, in which an estimated 100,000 people lost their lives. The war culminated in the Srebrenica genocide in July 1995, in which the Bosnian Serb forces, led by General Ratko Mladić, known as the “Butcher of Bosnia”, massacred more than 8,000 men and boys in a United Nations-designated “safe area”.

In the following decades, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia heard hundreds of witnesses and sentenced dozens of high-ranking Bosnian Serb political and military leaders, including those convicted of genocide. Meanwhile, the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina and foreign donors put significant funds into the study, victim recovery and remembrance of the genocide.

When the genocide in Gaza began, many Bosnians who survived the 1992-1995 war saw striking parallels between their own experiences and the suffering of Palestinians. Many took to the streets and spoke out against the genocidal war in Palestine.

However, many Bosnian intellectuals, especially those researching war crimes and genocide, have remained silent. Their refusal to speak out harms not just efforts to deliver justice for Gaza but also undermines the field of genocide studies.

Voices of conscience

Before we explore why Gaza has become such a taboo topic for Bosnian genocide scholars, it is important to point out that not all have remained silent. A relatively small group of Bosnian scholars who are not only academics but also active advocates for Palestine and human rights have chosen to speak up.

University professors and researchers, such as Lejla Kreševljaković, Sanela Čekić Bašić, Gorana Mlinarević, Jasna Fetahović, and Sanela Kapetanović have underscored that there is moral responsibility not to remain silent. They have led by example, participating in protests and speaking out in public.

Belma Buljubašić, a professor at the Faculty of Political Science at the University of Sarajevo, has criticised European and other political leaders who express sympathy for Srebrenica while justifying Israel’s actions in Gaza as acts of “self-defence”. Such double standards, she has argued, reveal a troubling pragmatism that undermines both solidarity and accountability.

In a recent interview, Edina Bećirević, a genocide scholar at the University of Sarajevo’s Faculty of Criminalistics, Criminology and Security Studies, said the genocide in Gaza clearly mirrors the dynamics seen in Srebrenica, defined by dehumanisation, ideological mobilisation and international complicity.

Ahmet Alibašić, the director of the Center for Advanced Studies and professor at the Faculty of Islamic Studies at the University of Sarajevo, has also been outspoken. Last year, he co-organised a seminar called From the Balkans to Gaza: A Critical Analysis of Genocide, which examined contemporary dynamics of mass violence through a “comparison between the Srebrenica genocide, the Sarajevo siege and the unfolding genocide in Gaza”.

Nidžara Ahmetašević, a Sarajevo-based journalist and media scholar, has also not hesitated to draw parallels between Gaza and the experiences of Bosnian survivors from besieged Sarajevo and Srebrenica.

For months, members of the Sarajevo Feminist Anti-Militarist Collective have been conducting demonstrations in downtown Sarajevo in which they read the names of children killed in Gaza, juxtaposing war crimes in the occupied Palestinian territory to Sarajevo’s own war horrors.

These individuals have all responded in various ways to the late Palestinian scholar Edward Said’s enduring exhortation that intellectuals must claim the space to speak truth to power, connect local memory to global justice and resist the politics of convenient truth-telling. Silence remains not a neutral stance but a political choice that sustains harm.

‘Not our battle’

Still, Said’s call has not stirred everyone to action. Paradoxically, many Bosnian genocide scholars have remained conspicuously silent, even as their colleagues abroad, among them Israeli genocide scholars Omer Bartov, Amos Goldberg and Shmuel Lederman, have publicly accused Israel of committing genocide in Gaza. This did not change even after the International Association of Genocide Scholars, the world’s largest academic body in the field, passed a resolution in August declaring that Israel’s actions in Gaza constitute a genocide.

Various experts on genocide at the University of Sarajevo’s Institute for Research of Crimes Against Humanity and International Law, lecturers at the Faculty of Law of the University of Sarajevo and genocide scholars at the Institute for Islamic Tradition of Bosniaks have been reluctant to comment on Israeli war crimes in Gaza.

As an institution, the Institute for Research of Crimes Against Humanity and International Law publicly addressed Gaza only after it was clear a ceasefire was soon to take effect. On October 8, it issued an evasive statement that did not mention Israel as the perpetrator of atrocities. This prompted some observers to accuse the institute, led by Muamer Džananović, of a calculated and opportunistic approach to the issue.

However, probably the most notable is the case of Emir Suljagić, genocide survivor and director of the Srebrenica Memorial Center. When asked about his stance on Gaza in late 2023, Suljagić told Haaretz: “This is not our battle.”

Many Bosnia-watchers swiftly condemned his remarks, pointing at the double standards of his position, given that just a year earlier Suljagić published an op-ed urging Ukrainians “not to lay down their arms”.

Furthermore, under his leadership, the Srebrenica Memorial Center produced a series of case studies funded by the United Kingdom government on Ukraine, Syria, South Sudan and Ethiopia, highlighting early warning signs of mass violence and genocide.

When the Palestinian community in Bosnia and Herzegovina expressed surprise over the lack of solidarity from Srebrenica with the people of Gaza, questioning whether the Srebrenica Memorial Center’s ties to the World Jewish Congress had something to do with its silence, Suljagić responded by accusing them of anti-Semitism.

He went even as far as to compare Hamas members to Chetniks, Serb nationalist and royalist forces that collaborated with German, Italian and at times Croatian fascists during World War II. Chetniks were responsible for some of the most brutal atrocities, including acts of genocide, against the Bosnian Muslim population. Almost half a century later, their enduring ideology fuelled war crimes and genocide against Bosniaks during the war in Bosnia.

The price of silence

The silence of many of Bosnia’s genocide scholars is not accidental. Some of them fear professional repercussions in Western academia and feel that accusing Israel of genocide would be unfavourable for their careers. Many are reluctant to jeopardise external financial support from foreign embassies, particularly funding provided by American, British and European Union donors to their projects and “side hustle” NGOs. Others are reluctant to alienate diplomatic partners who still wield influence over Bosnia’s fragile peace.

None of this, of course, justifies the silence of scholars working at institutions funded by Bosnian taxpayers rather than foreign donors. As genocide researchers whose work is sustained by public funds, they have an obligation to serve the public interest, which entails upholding scientific integrity, defending evidence-based genocide research and contributing to the global scholarly consensus without fear of professional repercussions.

When scholars, genocide researchers and lecturers at public institutions fail to speak out on war crimes or humanitarian crises, they contribute to legitimising a discourse that conceals harm. Such a discourse frames certain acts of mass violence as unworthy of the same scrutiny applied to other cases, creating a hierarchy of victimhood that serves political interests rather than universal principles and scholarly integrity.

Said’s universal call on intellectuals to speak out remains relevant and urgent. It reminds us that we need to move beyond comfortable silence, expose distortions of power and advocate for justice, transparency and accountability. In his view, silence is a form of complicity that undermines the very pursuit of truth that academia claims to uphold.

In this sense, public intellectuals must never allow themselves to slip into the realm of political bargaining where silence about one genocide is traded for recognition of another. If their advocacy becomes selective, then they risk turning genocide studies into a political tool. If that happens, genocide scholars will cease to be independent academics and instead become an interest group, stripped of the moral pedestal they so readily claim.

By foregrounding Gaza within the Bosnian context, we argue for a renewed ethic of intellectual responsibility and integrity, one that aligns scholarly discernment with public accountability and humane justice.

Outside the Field Museum in Chicago, a bronze sculpture by artist Marla Friedman captures a moment a friendship was made.

It's called ""The Red Palm Nut."" A young woman sits barefoot on the ground, reaching out her hand to a chimpanzee, who sits about a yard away. And he lightly, seemingly shyly, takes her human fingers into his own. A bright, red palm nut has dropped on the soil between them.

The woman in the sculpture is the great primatologist and conservationist Jane Goodall, at the moment she first earned the trust of a wild chimp. ""He reached out and he took and dropped that palm nut,"" she later remembered. ""But then very gently squeezed my fingers and that's how chimpanzees reassure each other. So in that moment we understood each other without the use of human words, the language of gestures.""

Jane Goodall called the silvery-chinned chimp David Greybeard. She met him when she was in her 20s, a former secretary from Bournemouth, England, who saved cash tips she'd earned as a waitress to journey to Africa, where she talked herself into a job as assistant to the famed anthropologist Louis Leakey.

She had no college experience. But Jane Goodall convinced Leakey she would be just the person to live among and study a group of chimpanzees he had discovered on the shores of Lake Tanganyika.

And on what she recalled was a rainy morning, November 4, 1960, she saw David Greybeard and other chimps take twigs from a tree, pluck their leaves, and use them as sticks to pierce a termite mound and slurp the insects off the end — almost like how those primates called human beings might lick peanut butter off a spoon.

What she saw and documented was startling: the chimps had made the twigs into tools. When she wrote about it to Louis Leakey, he famously replied, ""We must now redefine man, redefine tools, or accept chimpanzees as humans.""

By the time Jane Goodall died this week, at the age of 91, she'd been honored around the world for her work with chimps and people, and established animal sanctuaries and forest conservation programs.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/nov/17/mulatu-astatke-review-ethio-jazz-ljf-southbank-centre-royal-festival-hall,Mulatu Astatke review – father of Ethio-jazz still innovating during farewell tour,"Absolutely nothing about this set feels predictable: at 81, Mulatu Astatke is still pushing the boundaries of genre. Even on his farewell tour, there is no easing in, either. The father of Ethio-jazz and his band immediately play Tsome Diguwa as if conjuring a thunderstorm, which in turn crashes straight into Zèlèsègna Dèwèl, a piece written in the 4th-century Ethiopian tradition, its harmonic minor tonality sounding almost Arabic.

Astatke has a serious demeanour. Unsentimental, he speaks only to introduce songs or instruct the band like a schoolteacher. But he views his vibraphone with care and bewilderment, playing with intense familiarity yet almost as though discovering it for the first time. His fascination with his instrument holds the audience captive in turn. During Yèkèrmo Sèw – which fittingly translates to “a man of experience and wisdom” – Astatke’s solo fills the room, water-like in its shapeshifting.

The set is equally a showcase for his band. That song, as well as Nètsanèt, highlight their instrumental range and individual capabilities, with solos from James Arben (saxophone), Byron Wallen (trumpet), Danny Keane (plucking cello) and Alexander Hawkins (grand piano). For Kulun, an Ethiopian wedding song, two Ethiopian musicians join the ensemble, playing a masinko (a single-stringed, bowed, lute-like instrument) and a krar (a five-stringed, plucked lyre), and two dancers in traditional outfits also enter to the delight of the crowd. For Azmari and Chik Chikka, technical and highly experimental solos from Keane and John Edwards (double bass) are interspersed with dance breaks.

View image in fullscreen Photograph: Sonja Horsman/The Guardian

It’s a set rich in sensation. Edwards rubs the double bass body creating a cat-like screech, or drags the bow in an exact replica of a yawn. Richard Baker provides West African percussion astride conga drums, Saworo bells (a selection of traditional hunter’s bells and beer bottle tops), metal bells (Adodo, Apitua, Aja Orisa) and dùndún “talking” drum, creating rich texture throughout. For Yègellé Tezeta, he also sings in Yoruba in call-and-response with Edwards’ conversational bass. Astatke introduces the penultimate song, Mulatu, as “a piece I composed for myself”: it sounds like a wandering train of thought with glittering bells and mystical keyboard.

There’s a rousing encore in Yèkatit. Where you might expect its crescendo to be resolved in a crash of drums, instead, Astatke guides drummer Ben Brown in a muted, controlled whisper of cymbals. It’s true to the reputation Astatke has built over his five-decade career: a whirlwind of experimentation and excitement, but always with deliberation and control.

NBC News Think,https://www.nbcnews.com/world/india/dharmendra-iconic-bollywood-actor-indian-cinemas-man-dies-89-rcna245592,"Dharmendra, iconic Bollywood actor and Indian cinema’s ‘he-man,’ dies at 89","NEW DELHI — Dharmendra, one of Indian cinema’s most popular stars whose versatile performances made him a defining screen presence of 1970s and 1980s Bollywood films, died Monday.

He was 89.

The actor, who would have turned 90 on Dec. 8, had been in and out of a hospital in the financial capital, Mumbai, over the past few weeks.

A senior police official who had spoken with Dharmendra’s doctor confirmed the death on the condition of anonymity.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered his condolences, saying the actor’s death marks the end of an era in Indian cinema.

“He was an iconic film personality, a phenomenal actor who brought charm and depth to every role he played. The manner in which he played diverse roles struck a chord with countless people,” Modi said on the social media platform X.

Often called Bollywood’s “he-man,” Dharmendra combined the old-school heroism of an action star with the tenderness of a romantic lead, making him one of India’s most iconic actors. Though most of his fame came from roles in which he embodied the archetype of a larger-than-life hero — upright, patriotic and fearless — his charming performances in romantic hits equally made him popular with the masses.

Dharmendra’s performance in “Sholay” (1975) — Bollywood’s take on the Spaghetti Western and regarded as one of India’s greatest films — earned him enduring popularity. His roles in other Hindi-language hits, from the romantic comedy “Chupke Chupke” (1975) to the action drama “Mera Gaon Mera Desh” (1971), made him one of the most recognizable film faces from that era.

His role in Bollywood classic “Sholay,” in which he played an affable character alongside Amitabh Bachchan, his co-actor in the film, cemented his status as a superstar. The duo’s on-screen partnership also became one of Bollywood’s most iconic pairings.

His on-screen chemistry with actress Hema Malini, whom he later married, became one of Bollywood’s most popular collaborations, as the pair acted together in more than two dozen films. But their union was rooted in scandal. Dharmendra had married Prakash Kaur before his film debut, and went on to have four children with her, including two who would follow in his acting footsteps — Sunny Deol and Bobby Deol.

Despite his marriage to Malini in 1980, he reportedly never divorced Kaur and continued to live with her. According to local media reports, he briefly converted to Islam before marrying Malini as Indian law disallows Hindus to marry twice, especially if their spouse is alive.

Dharmendra and Malini had two daughters, including Bollywood actor Esha Deol. His nephew, Abhay Deol, also joined the industry.

Later in his career, Dharmendra moved to more character-driven roles, frequently portraying paternal figures in the 1990s and 2000s in a career that continued through 2025. He was last seen in war biopic film “Ikkis.”

“I never thought I would come this far,” he said in a 2021 interview with Indian news website Rediff.

Born Dharmendra Kewal Krishan Deol in India’s northern state of Punjab in 1935, he grew up in a farming family and moved to Mumbai in the late 1950s, making his Bollywood debut in 1960. Over a career spanning six decades, he acted in more than 300 films.

In 2012, Dharmendra was awarded the Padma Bhushan, India’s third-highest civilian honor, in recognition of his contribution to Indian cinema. He also briefly turned to politics, serving as a Bharatiya Janata Party lawmaker in Parliament from 2004 to 2009, though his political stint was short-lived.

Dharmendra is survived by his wives, children and grandchildren.",2025-11-24 13:30:48.341000+00:00,literal,Factual reporting on reporting and policy,literal,literal,0,figurative,0.29952326,0.7004767,0.7004767,False
Al Jazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/11/22/how-the-us-israeli-peace-plan-will-partition-gaza,How the US-Israeli ‘peace plan’ will partition Gaza,"Since the ceasefire was announced on October 10, the division of Gaza into a so-called “green zone” under Israeli army control and a so-called “red zone”, where Palestinians have been displaced and contained, has solidified. Separating the two is the invisible “yellow line”.

The administration of United States President Donald Trump has signalled that reconstruction will be limited to the “green zone” where Israel and its allies have been working on plans for so-called “alternative safe communities”.

Although there are reports last week that these plans were dropped, colleagues in the humanitarian field have informed me that the first such community is still slated to be built in Rafah, southern Gaza and a further 10 are planned along the yellow line and into the north.

If plans for these “safe communities” proceed, they would cement a deadly fragmentation of Gaza. The purpose of creating these camps is not to provide humanitarian relief but to create zones of managed dispossession where Palestinians would be screened and vetted to enter in order to receive basic services, but would be explicitly barred from returning to the off-limits and blockaded “red zone”.

These plans represent a recycled version of what Israel has long wanted to do in Gaza. The creation of “bubbles” – an initial, telling euphemism that I first heard proposed by the Israeli authorities when I was part of coordinating humanitarian operations in Palestine as a United Nations official – was the first iteration of areas where Palestinians would be screened and would be conditioned to receive controlled assistance.

This is the grim reality of the so-called ceasefire deal in Gaza. It will not deliver peace; it will further shatter Gaza and the prospect for Palestinian sovereignty into pieces. If anything, it is a Gaza piece plan.

On Monday this week, the United Nations Security Council voted to legitimise the plan by endorsing a board of peace to manage Gaza and an international stabilisation force (ISF) to provide security. But what areas will these forces secure? There is no agreed-upon peace for these forces to keep. According to maps I have seen of the “alternative safe communities”, the ISF would be positioned along the yellow line and would secure these newly established camps.

Hamas has unsurprisingly rejected the UNSC resolution. It was obvious that its provisions were not the outcome of a negotiated agreement. In the 20-point Trump plan, which was attached as an annex to the resolution, point 17 may now be invoked: “in the event Hamas delays or rejects this proposal, the above, including the scaled-up aid operations, will proceed in the terror-free areas handed over from the IDF [Israeli army] to the ISF”. In this way, the “alternative safe communities” may become the only enabled aid delivery centres, thereby prolonging the total blockade on Palestinians in Gaza.

The deadly logic of evacuation orders that marked the past two years and which drove Palestinians out of their homes, is now being extended into the UNSC-endorsed plan. Those who remain outside of the alternative communities, in the “red zone”, risk being labelled “Hamas supporters” and therefore ineligible for protection under Israel’s warped interpretation of international law and subject to ongoing military operations, as already seen in past days.

The fate of Palestinians in the “red zone” remains conspicuously absent from official planning. In fact, humanitarian organisations capable of saving lives are being squeezed out by an Israeli registration process designed to stifle criticism and vet staff for compliance.

The model of contained communities is not entirely new. The British created “new villages” in Malaya in the 1950s, the Americans created “strategic hamlets” in Vietnam in the 1960s, and the colonial authorities in Rhodesia (today’s Zimbabwe) created “protected villages” in the 1970s during so-called “counter-insurgency”.

Civilian populations were coerced and forced into camps where they were screened in return for aid. The plan was to diminish popular support for resistance groups who were fighting colonial rule. It failed.

In South Africa, the apartheid government created bantustans, pseudo-independent homelands designed to concentrate and control the Black population. They also failed to prevent the collapse of a settler-colonial apartheid regime.

In Gaza, the peace plan that has been imposed rather than negotiated will leave Israel’s occupation not only intact but emboldened. The UNSC has endorsed something that goes against the rulings of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on the occupied Palestinian territory, essentially whitewashing a genocidal crime scene and creating a monument to impunity.

All of this unfolds during a so-called ceasefire, in which Palestinians continue to be killed for crossing invisible lines drawn by an illegal occupation.

The world might hail this phase as an end to the war, and states reluctant to sanction Israel are undoubtedly relieved to revive trade and reduce public scrutiny.

Moving beyond this dangerous status quo will require the very accountability the US and Israel have worked hard to avoid: implementing the rulings of the ICJ. While Western powers hollow out these institutions, new political coalitions are needed to demand the equal application of international law. At its most basic level, this requires the unhindered delivery of humanitarian aid to Palestinians wherever they are in the strip and Palestinian-led reconstruction that ensures Palestinians are not perpetually condemned to bare survival.

The precedent set in Gaza would not be contained within the fences of Gaza’s gated communities sealed by international forces: it would further erode the foundations of a so-called rules-based order. The only way forward is a return to the principle this entire process has so far ignored: the inalienable right of a people to determine their own future.

It is daunting to try to recall all the politically motivated attacks, and attempted attacks, in America over the last few years.

This year alone: someone set fire to the Pennsylvania's governor's residence while Governor Josh Shapiro and his family slept upstairs.

Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim, Israeli embassy workers, were shot and killed in Washington, D.C.

82-year-old Karen Diamond died, and several others were burned, in a fire-bombing attack on a march in Boulder, Colorado.

A week after that, Minnesota State Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, were shot and killed at their home. The Hortmans' killer also shot State Senator John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, who survived.

Last year, there were two attempts to assassinate Donald Trump during his presidential campaign. One bullet only narrowly missed its mark, grazing Trump's ear. But a supporter sitting behind him was killed.

Early in 2022, someone tried to shoot Craig Greenberg, then running for mayor of Louisville. The bullets came close, but missed.

That summer, a man was arrested outside the home of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, with plans to assassinate the Justice.

In the fall, Paul Pelosi, husband of then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was attacked with a hammer inside the couple's San Francisco home.

We may have vivid memories of rioters storming the U.S. Capitol on January 6th, 2021, trying to prevent a joint session of Congress from certifying the votes of the Electoral College.

But do we remember that the same day, pipe bombs were found outside both the Democratic and Republican National Committee headquarters, where they could have exploded and killed people?

Or that in 2020, the FBI uncovered a plot to kidnap the Governor of Michigan, Gretchen Whitmer? And in 2017, a man shot up a congressional baseball practice in northern Virginia, wounding four people including Congressman Steve Scalise?

Meetings in Geneva produced an “updated and refined peace framework,” Ukraine and the U.S. said in a joint statement that described ""meaningful progress"" from the ""highly productive"" talks.

No specific details were released. European leaders expressed optimism but cautioned that ""major issues"" remained as Kyiv and its allies sought to navigate the U.S. ultimatum to accept the 28-point proposal they view as handing the Kremlin its key demands.

Moscow continued to suggest it had been shut out of the discussions, and it was unclear whether any counterproposals from Ukraine would be acceptable to Russia.

President Donald Trump also weighed in. ""Is it really possible that big progress is being made in Peace Talks between Russia and Ukraine??? Don’t believe it until you see it, but something good just may be happening,"" he said in a post on Truth Social early Monday.

The Ukrainian delegation was on its way home to report back on the progress made, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. “Based on these reports, we will determine the next steps and the timing,” he added.

Speaking earlier by video link at a summit in Sweden, Zelenskyy said that Kyiv was working with partners ""to look for compromises that strengthen but not weaken us.""

He had warned Friday that his country faced perhaps its most difficult week yet, confronting the choice between its “dignity” and a “key partner.”

Trump injected greater tension as talks took place in Switzerland, accusing Kyiv of expressing “zero gratitude” to the U.S. for its support throughout the conflict.

Yet, Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters that “a tremendous amount of progress” had been made after the talks with Ukraine.

Zelenskyy, attempting the balancing act of appeasing Trump and ensuring his nation's sovereignty while under fire at home for a corruption scandal, said that “Ukraine was grateful to the United States, to every American heart, and to President Trump personally.”

In a separate statement, Zelenskyy said there were “signals President Trump’s team is hearing us.”

Asked about the pressure on Ukraine to at least agree to a framework by Thanksgiving, Rubio said the U.S. wants to “get this done” as soon as possible. “Obviously, we’d love it to be Thursday,” he added.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday that there are no plans for Zelenskyy to come to the White House “at this moment in time” but advised things can change quickly. She added that Rubio, special envoy Steve Witkoff and the team in Geneva worked through the 28-point peace plan with input from both the Russians and the Ukrainians over the weekend.

“The vast majority of these points have been agreed upon. The Ukrainians have worked on language with us together, and you heard that from their delegation directly yesterday. So we feel as though we’re in a very good place,” Leavitt said. “Of course, we have to make sure that all of these points are agreed to. And then, of course, we’re going to have to make sure the other party in this war, the Russians, agree to them, as well.”

But, while there were signs of progress, Europe remained wary as America's traditional allies scrambled to respond to the sudden emergence of a deal that could define the continent's security.

“The negotiations were a step forward, but there are still major issues which remain to be resolved,” Finnish President Alexander Stubb said on X.

European Union leaders met to discuss the issue at a summit already taking place in Angola on Monday, as a counterproposal from major European powers circulated in the media.

“While work remains to be done, there is now a solid basis for moving forward,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement following the meeting.

A German government spokesperson said Berlin saw the progress made in Geneva “very positively,” according to Reuters.

The plan backed by Trump amounts to Ukraine's effective capitulation, ceding key territories to Russia while reducing its military in return for no major concessions from Moscow.

Russian President Vladimir Putin wants legal recognition for what he has “stolen,” Zelenskyy said Monday in reference to the plan’s provision for the entire eastern Donbas region, as well as Crimea, annexed in 2014, to be de facto recognized as Russian. “To break the principle of territorial integrity and sovereignty, and that’s the main problem,” he added.

U.S. allies and lawmakers have raised questions over who may have been behind the plan and how much Ukraine was consulted.

Rubio insisted Sunday that the plan was authored by the U.S. after a bipartisan group of senators said he had told them that the text being discussed was a Russian initiative given to special envoy Witkoff.

Moscow has maintained it has not officially been looped in to talks.

During a call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on Monday, Putin said the plan, ""in the version we have reviewed,"" is consistent with discussions at his summer summit with Trump in Alaska, ""and, in principle, could form the basis for a final peace settlement,"" according to a Kremlin readout.

Still, it’s unclear if the Kremlin would agree to any modifications that would be necessary to get Ukraine and Europe to sign on.

On Monday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that it has not been updated on the progress of talks between Ukraine and the U.S. “We have, of course, been closely monitoring media reports that have been pouring in over the past few days, including from Geneva. But we haven’t received anything official yet,” he said.

Few dates on the calendar get shorter shrift than poor old November 18. Bereft of major holidays, all but anonymous, and cold — but not even cold enough to snow (at least in a lot of the U.S.) — it makes a strong claim for the year's least notable day.

So spare a bit of pity for Tara Selter. When readers first met the narrator of Danish author Solvej Balle's ongoing septology, On the Calculation of Volume, Tara was already on her 121st November 18 in a row. That number now stands well north of 1,100 (and counting) as the third installment of this mesmerizing time loop gets its English translation Tuesday.

The Pelican Child: Stories, by Joy Williams

Williams is one of our most accomplished adepts in the art of estrangement — in literally making the mundane strange. The short stories in her latest collection are spiny little nuggets of jamais vu. Sure, they tend to bear the distinguishing characteristics of the familiar world, with all its stressed assistants and heiresses and bewildered man-children, but they're also moved by some alien inner logic that can be disquietingly difficult to discern. In Williams' hands, reality is a changeling with an occasionally wicked sense of humor.

This is my sixth year covering Black Friday for NBC Select, so I know how to find deals that are actually worth buying. I spent weeks combing through thousands of discounts to find the best early Black Friday deals— each one I recommend below is highly rated and 20% off or more. When possible, I ran deals through price trackers to make sure they’re at their lowest price in at least three months or the lowest price ever. I’ll frequently update this list leading up to Black Friday.

“I use this gel moisturizer on nights when my face is feeling particularly dry and I wake up the next day with soft, hydrated skin,” says NBC Select editorial projects manager Rebecca Rodriguez. “The thick jelly texture means a little goes a long way, so I spread a thin layer across my face and can still feel it in the morning.” The cream is made with collagen to firm and plumpen skin, as well as moisturizing ingredients like niacinamide, squalane and hyaluronic acid.

The NBC Select staff agrees that Legos are one of the best gifts for all ages — it’s an engaging, screen-free activity, and once you’re done with a build, it becomes a piece of home (or desk) decor. This set comes with pieces to make three mini bonsai trees: a ginkgo, a black pine and a wisteria tree. Lego recommends it for those ages 18 and up, and one to three people can construct the trees together.

Yeti drinkware is a popular gift in my family, and I’ve personally received this tumbler because my loved ones know how often I take my iced coffee and smoothies on the go. The 42-ounce, dishwasher-safe cup is made from stainless steel and has double-wall vacuum insulation, which helps keep drinks hot or cold for hours, in my experience. The large handle makes the tumbler easy to hold, its base is cup holder-compatible and it comes with a straw lid that you can take apart for easy cleaning. I also appreciate that the exterior of the cup doesn’t produce condensation, so whatever surface I put it on stays dry.

“I bring almost my entire bathroom with me while traveling, and this cosmetic case is one of the only ones that can handle my excess of products,” says Rodriguez. “When I first used it, I was dumbfounded by how much of my makeup and skin care fit inside. It also feels luxe with its faux-leather exterior and gold zippers.” Since the cosmetics case is clear, you can always see what’s inside and easily wipe it down to clean as needed. It also comes in tiny, small and large sizes, all of which are on sale.

4.4-star average rating from 17 reviews at Hanna Andersson

I like to think of myself as somewhat of a pajama set connoisseur, and out of all the options I own, Hanna Andersson’s are my all-time favorite. I’ve bought them for adults and kids in my life, especially if I’m struggling with a gift idea, and there are lots of options if you’re looking for matching holiday pajamas the whole family can wear. This set is made from lightweight, buttery soft, moisture-wicking fabric and the top and bottoms both have a relaxed fit with piping detail. They fit true to size, in my experience.

How I found the best early Black Friday deals

All of my recommendations above are based on NBC Select’s previous coverage and reporting, including products the NBC Select staff tested firsthand. I vetted each deal to ensure it’s 20% off or more and highly rated, with an average rating of 4.0 or higher from hundreds of reviews. When possible, I ran deals through price trackers like CamelCamelCamel to prioritize highlighting products that are at their lowest price in at least three months or the lowest price ever.

I also wrote about every deal in this article and worked with NBC Select editors to finalize the live list, which I frequently update throughout Black Friday to reflect the latest prices. For more information on our editorial team and how we choose products, check out this page.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/23/the-guardian-view-on-the-young-persons-benefit-trap-rachel-reeves-must-fix-this-flaw-in-the-budget#comments,The Guardian view on the young person’s benefit trap: Rachel Reeves must fix this flaw in the budget | Editorial,"Consider being a young homeless person on benefits today. Those aged 16-24 who can’t live at home often end up in supported housing. This could be a shared flat or a hostel, where specialist staff are on hand to help. But such young people frequently have to cover service charges and bills – at an age when they should be building a future, not worrying about basic costs.

It’s good that the state steps in to support vulnerable young people. But wrong that it can undermine that help in practice. For the last eight years, campaigners have warned that young people in supported housing are penalised more harshly for earning than their non-homeless counterparts – and it’s a UK-wide problem. For every £1 these youngsters earn over their small earnings allowance, their housing benefit is reduced by 65p, compared with 55p for those in the private rental sector. Perversely, the flaw crept in during reforms meant to guarantee people on benefits were always better off in work.

Penalising young homeless people who want to work more is clearly counterintuitive. Anecdotally, those in the housing sector say it causes plenty of young people to forego meaningful work. You can see why: someone working 10 hours could lose more than £100 a month for picking up an 11th hour of work. That can narrow their options, as they find themselves having to be prescriptive about their hours, competing with peers who can be more flexible. In the longer run, it can reduce their prospects. In some cases, staff find themselves in the unenviable position of dissuading young people from taking a job lest they put their housing in jeopardy.

For a government that wants to “make work pay”, this can’t be right. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has a chance to fix the problem in the budget. Young people have been the worst affected by rising unemployment, and while Ms Reeves has made the right moves – promising paid work for young people on universal credit who haven’t found education or employment after 18 months – those plans remain sketchy. It surely makes sense for Ms Reeves to ensure that incentives to work apply equally to all young people.

A new campaign, fronted by 150 youth and homeless organisations, warns of a financial “cliff edge” that makes rent unaffordable and increases the risk of arrears. Charities say the earnings allowance should rise from a token £5 to about £57, and the housing benefit taper should be brought down from 65% to 55% to match universal credit.

These are sensible, practical measures that would ensure that some of the country’s poorest people get financial help. It would also signal that the government is invested in making the country fairer for them. The homeless charity Centrepoint says it’s a win-win policy. The Treasury, it calculates, will gain £5m a year as more young people move into work. Once wider outcomes – such as improved health and reduced crime – are considered, the net gain is £13m annually.

There is a generational crisis bubbling under Britain’s surface in which young people face rising unemployment, insecure housing and falling real wages. Their futures, it feels, are being shaped less by opportunity and more by precarity. If ministers truly want to “make work pay” for everyone, they’ll have to explain why 30,000 young homeless people are the one group excluded from that promise. It’s time to act.",2025-11-23 00:00:00,literal,Factual reporting on policy and elections,literal,literal,0,literal,0.94346714,0.0565329,0.94346714,True
Al Jazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/11/17/ice-cream-and-maga-drama-in-the-american-swamp,Ice cream and MAGA drama in the American swamp,"Trump’s breakup with some Republicans may entertain, but it won’t pull American politics out of the plutocratic bog.

In the latest episode of the soap opera that passes for politics in the United States, President Donald Trump has dramatically split with Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, a former ally and a notorious wearer of the MAGA hat.

Writing on his Truth Social platform on Friday, Trump denounced his fellow Republican as “wacky” and “Far Left”, claiming that he did not have time to deal with her alleged barrage of phone calls: “I can’t take a ranting Lunatic’s call every day.”

As The New York Times noted, Trump had previously “stood by” Greene when she was criticised “for voicing conspiracy theories about the Sept. 11 attacks, school shootings and wildfires started by space lasers”.

Anyway, nothing “Lunatic” about any of that.

Greene denies having called the president, saying instead that she had texted him to suggest that he cease endeavouring to thwart the full release of the so-called Epstein files pertaining to the late paedophile and disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, which may implicate Trump.

The US House of Representatives is set to vote this week on the matter – and Greene is not the only Republican to have broken ranks. Several other House Republicans have also defied Trump on the Epstein front, including Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Lauren Boebert of Colorado.

In a typical about-face, Trump has now spontaneously reversed his position on the Epstein files, posting on Truth Social late on Sunday: “House Republicans should vote to release the Epstein files, because we have nothing to hide.”

And yet the Epstein files are hardly the only issue that raises the question of whether MAGA might not be headed for some sort of self-combustion.

As Trump recently reminded Americans, “Don’t forget, MAGA was my idea. MAGA was nobody else’s idea.”

And so it’s only logical that folks would associate the distinct failure to “make America great again” with the idea man himself.

Outright propaganda can only go so far – and people tend to notice when they don’t have enough money to put food on the table in spite of upbeat presidential pronouncements regarding the state of the economy.

Even Trump has apparently realised, to some extent, that he stands to further alienate his base by insisting on nonsensical tariffs and other punitive financial measures. As a nonsolution, the government will now lower tariffs on coffee and bananas while the president muses over potential $2,000 tariff rebate cheques and 50-year mortgages.

A November 14 White House news release blamed the Democrats for the country’s “economic mess” but assured citizens that “grocery prices and housing prices are trending in the right direction” with prices “for everyday staples” such as ice cream seeing “declines”.

The news release ended on the inspiring note: “We’re making progress – and the best is yet to come.”

In addition to the cost-of-living crisis, another source of rising discontent among Republicans is US support for Israel. In July, Greene became the first Republican lawmaker to call the genocide in the Gaza Strip by name, condemning the “starvation” of Palestinians.

To be sure, US aid to Israel is not just a Republican thing; Trump’s Democratic predecessor Joe Biden was more than happy to fling tens of billions of dollars at the genocidal state as it went about starving and otherwise annihilating civilians in Gaza.

The Trump administration, however, has added a slight twist to business as usual by not only backing Israel to the hilt but also simultaneously threatening to starve poor Americans at home by withholding essential food assistance.

But, hey, at least the price of ice cream is “declining”.

Last week, two days before his official breakup with Greene, Trump took to Truth Social to warn that “only a very bad, or stupid Republican would fall into” the Democratic “trap” of the “Jeffrey Epstein Hoax”, allegedly concocted purely to detract attention from the Democrats’ wide-ranging transgressions.

But it seems that an ever-greater number of MAGA adherents may be at risk of descending into badness and stupidity as Trump reveals himself to be maybe not the most qualified person to “drain the swamp in Washington, DC” – one of the president’s perennial promises to do away with corruption and other traditional political vices.

Indeed, Trump’s apoplectic fits over the possible release of details regarding Epstein – ie, someone who was very much entrenched in said “swamp” – do not bode well in terms of drainage prospects.

Then again, the fact that Americans re-elected a nepotistic billionaire and convicted criminal to head the country suggests that the swamp probably isn’t going anywhere anytime soon.

On a micro level, the intra-MAGA soap opera may provide some fleeting gratification for spectators. But it’s not like the drama sets the stage for any substantive improvement to the political panorama.

And while opposing Trump is, objectively speaking, a noble aim, we don’t really need any more people who think space lasers cause wildfires and compare pandemic safety measures to the Holocaust. Nor, for that matter, do we need any more genocide-enabling Democrats, who at the end of the day are just as committed as Republicans to maintaining a corrupt plutocracy.

Blind and unquestioning support for the president may be eroding among his MAGA base. But rest assured that the swamp is here to stay.

NBC News Think,https://www.nbcnews.com/world/ukraine/russia-strikes-ukraines-capital-us-peace-push-rcna245772,Russia strikes Ukraine's capital despite U.S. peace push,"KYIV, Ukraine — Russia launched a wave of attacks on Ukraine’s capital Kyiv early Tuesday, striking residential buildings and energy infrastructure, according to video footage and local authorities.

A residential building in the central Pechersk district and another in Kyiv’s eastern district of Dniprovskyi were badly damaged, Mayor Vitalii Kitschko said.

Video footage posted to Telegram showed a large fire spread through multiple floors of the nine-story building in Dniprovskyi. At least four people were injured, the head of Kyiv city administration, Tymor Tkachenko, said.

Ukraine’s energy ministry said that energy infrastructure had been hit, without specifying what type or the extent of the damage.

The Russian attack followed talks between U.S. and Ukraine representatives in Geneva on Sunday about a U.S.-Russia brokered peace plan.

Oleksandr Bevz, a delegate from the Ukrainian side, told The Associated Press on Monday that the talks had been “very constructive” and the two sides were able to discuss most points.

Al Jazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/11/24/no-there-is-no-ceasefire-in-gaza,"No, there is no ceasefire in Gaza","Israel’s bombing of Gaza is not a ‘violation of the ceasefire’. It is a continuing genocide under diplomatic cover.

When on October 10, a “ceasefire” was declared in Gaza, many Palestinians breathed a sigh of relief. They had just endured two years of constant bombardment estimated to equal roughly six times the explosive force of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945, concentrated on an area less than half the size of the Japanese city..

The devastation was all encompassing. All hospitals and universities had been bombed, most homes and schools destroyed and vital infrastructure, such as the sewage system and electricity lines, had been damaged beyond repair. An estimated 50 million tonnes of rubble was strewn across the strip and under it lay at least 10,000 bodies of Palestinians killed in bombardments who were yet to be recovered.

And yet, the respite the people of Gaza expected to finally come never materialised. Almost immediately after the “ceasefire” announcement, the Israeli regime started bombing the strip again. It hasn’t stopped since then.

According to Gaza’s Government Media Office, Israel has violated the “ceasefire” nearly 500 times in 44 days, killing 342 civilians. The deadliest day was on October 29 when the Israeli Occupation Forces (IOF) killed 109 Palestinians, including 52 children. More recently, on Thursday, 32 Palestinians were killed, including an entire family in the Zeitoun neighbourhood of Gaza City when a bomb was dropped on a building they were sheltering in.

But it is not just the bombardment that hasn’t stopped. The starvation hasn’t either.

As per the “ceasefire” agreement, 600 trucks of aid were supposed to be allowed in every day, which Israel has not fulfilled. As Al Jazeera’s correspondent Hind al-Khoudary has reported from Gaza, the IOF is permitting only 150 trucks a day to cross into the strip. They are also preventing the entry of nutritious foods, including meat, dairy and vegetables, as well as much-needed medicine, tents and other materials for shelter.

A coalition of Palestinian relief agencies estimated that the aid that enters now doesn’t even cover a quarter of the basic needs of the population.

The United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), which says it has enough food in its warehouses to feed everyone in Gaza for months, is still not allowed to bring in any of it. This is in direct contravention of an October advisory opinion by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) that the Israeli regime has a duty to not impede the supply of aid by UN agencies, including UNRWA.

The court also rejected Israeli accusations that the agency lacks neutrality and asserted that it is an indispensable actor in the humanitarian landscape. Nonetheless, the Israeli regime has rejected the advisory opinion and continues to limit UNRWA activities by preventing aid distribution and denying visas to its international staff.

The Israeli regime is also not abiding by the provisional measures that were laid out in an ICJ ruling in January 2024 that found that plausible acts of genocide were being committed in Gaza. These measures included preventing acts of genocide, preventing and punishing incitement to genocide and allowing humanitarian assistance into Gaza. Since then, the court has reaffirmed its provisional measures several times. The Israeli regime continues to ignore them.

And that is because on the international level, it continues to enjoy unprecedented diplomatic, financial and military cover. The latest iteration of that came on November 17 when the UN Security Council passed Resolution 2803, endorsing United States President Donald Trump’s 20-point plan for Gaza.

Among its provisions is the creation of two bodies that would take control of Gaza: the board of peace, chaired by Trump himself, and the international stabilisation force, tasked with maintaining security and enforcing the disarmament of Palestinian groups. The governing structure of both bodies remains unclear, but they would operate in coordination with the Israeli regime, effectively installing another layer of foreign control over the Palestinian people.

The resolution also allows for the bypassing of existing local and international structures in the distribution of aid. It makes no mention of the genocide and does not propose any mechanism for accountability for war crimes. Essentially, the resolution contravenes international law and gives the US – a co-perpetrator of genocide – control over Gaza.

All of this makes clear the fact that the “ceasefire” is not a ceasefire at all. The Israeli regime continues to attack Gaza, to starve the Palestinian population and to deny it access to proper shelter and healthcare.

Calling this arrangement a ceasefire allows third states to claim progress on conflict resolution and even peace when the core genocidal reality of the Palestinians on the ground remains largely unchanged. The “ceasefire” is a diplomatic sham – a cover for the continuing extermination, displacement and erasure of the Palestinian people in Gaza and a distraction for the international public and the media.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/global/commentisfree/2025/nov/24/macron-and-merz-europe-slide-far-right,Macron and Merz must look at themselves if they want to stop Europe sliding to the far right,"Europe’s leaders cannot stop talking about democracy. President Emmanuel Macron says he wants to kickstart a democratic “resurgence”, and Friedrich Merz, the German chancellor, has warned of an “axis” of autocratic states targeting liberal democracy in Europe. Having promised to “fight” for what she calls European “values”, Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, has just announced a new “democracy shield” and a Centre for Democratic Resilience to prevent foreign interference and deal with external threats. I keep hoping for similar scrutiny of democratic backsliding within the EU – but so far it has not happened.

Foreign interference, disinformation and the creeping illiberalism of Hungary, Poland and Slovakia deserve attention. But lost in this fretting is a more inconvenient truth: within Europe’s “mature” democracies, there is a steady corrosion of the rule of law, a degradation of political discourse and the normalisation of racism, xenophobia and discrimination.

Growing up in a country where democracy was fragile and frequently interrupted, I learned early that the issue is not merely about elections. It is about the quality of governance and of politicians. It depends on protecting human rights and dignity, ensuring social justice, respecting minorities – and minority views – and creating a genuine sense of belonging for all citizens.

That is why I am troubled when EU governments and political elites undermine the rule of law, constrain free speech, normalise police violence and ignore signs that racism and xenophobia have seeped into public life. Across the bloc, the demonisation of racialised refugees and migrants has become common. Ironically, even as they champion democratic renewal, Merz, Macron and von der Leyen are chipping away at the very values they claim to defend.

When Merz urged journalists to “ask your daughters” about why Germany’s changing “cityscape” threatens their security, he did more than infantilise German women. He activated toxic colonial and orientalist tropes of Black and brown men as violent, hypersexual, uncivilised aggressors, as bodies to be policed, controlled and deported. Though he later acknowledged migrants’ economic contributions, the damage was done. Merz moved Germany’s Overton window on what is considered acceptable in political discourse, thereby giving more oxygen to the far right.

In France, too, Macron’s legacy will be marked not only by his attempts at liberal reforms but by his legitimisation of far-right narratives. By echoing Marine Le Pen’s rhetoric on national identity, Islam and migration, Macron has normalised what was once unsayable for centrists. The far-right National Rally now stands as a respectable government-in-waiting precisely because the so-called liberal centre helped embed its ideas in the mainstream.

A similar dynamic is playing out within EU institutions. Italy’s Giorgia Meloni may have set the shameful example by outsourcing the processing of asylum seekers to Albania, but it is the European Commission that has incorporated deportation as a legitimate policy tool in the EU’s new migration pact – and von der Leyen who keeps signing migration-deterrence deals with regimes such as those in Tunisia and Egypt that are accused of abuse and torture.

Israel’s genocide in Gaza has laid bare the many ways in which the EU is in violation of its own norms and principles, as well as in flagrant breach of its obligations under international law to prevent and punish genocide. In Germany, police forces have been condemned by UN experts for criminalising and suppressing legitimate Palestinian solidarity activism. In Belgium, the use of teargas, batons and water cannon against peaceful protesters outside the European parliament prompted calls for an investigation from Amnesty International. EU institutions are quick to condemn state violence in other parts of the world, but are silent when it occurs within their own borders.

After every European election, we reassure ourselves that the “centre is holding”. The reality is that whether in national governments or in the European parliament, far-right parties are increasingly shaping the European agenda. The conservative European People’s party has grown ever-more comfortable forming majorities with far-right groups, especially on environmental policy. Politicians across Europe are adopting far-right talking points on migration and Muslims. The excuse is always that this is being done to contain the hardliners, even though studies consistently show that such mimicry amplifies and normalises extremism.

Still, there are glimmers of hope. Spain’s Pedro Sánchez has shown moral clarity on Gaza and adopted a national migration policy which is rooted in dignity and solidarity. In the Netherlands, Rob Jetten of the centre-left D66, expected to lead a new coalition, ran on a platform of hope rather than hate and spoke out against Israel’s genocide. The UK Green party’s Zack Polanski and Ireland’s new president Catherine Connolly are helping to revive a progressive political discourse in their countries. And across the Atlantic, New York’s new mayor, Zohran Mamdani, a proud son of immigrants and unapologetic advocate for justice, housing and solidarity, has demonstrated that democracy’s vitality depends on moral courage and inclusive coalitions – and that racial and religious identity can be a source of pride.

European leaders should take note that, even as the EU arms itself with a “democracy shield”, strengthening democratic resilience is not only about fighting external threats, adversaries and disinformation. It is also about building inclusive democracy at home, dismantling racism, ensuring equality and creating a sense of belonging for all European citizens.",2025-11-24 00:00:00,irony,Uses word ironically to indicate contradiction,irony,figurative,1,figurative,0.0022001234,0.9977998,0.9977998,True
The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/nov/21/pollyfromthedirt-the-best-new-tracks,Pollyfromthedirt’s grey-skied Anglo ambience and the week’s best new tracks,"From Darlington, County Durham

Recommended if you like Blood Orange, Dean Blunt, Elliott Smith

Up next The Dirt Pt 1 EP out now

As the internet spits out underground artists like mouthwash, it’s becoming harder to separate the visionaries from the vibe-hackers. But Pollyfromthedirt’s jagged pastoral pop demands more than just a passing scroll. Released independently this week, the County Durham native’s first EP clashes brass band samples, shuddering Midi strings and awkward acoustic guitar together. There’s a trace of Elliott Smith in his grey-skied songwriting, yet made entirely his own by the crude drum machines, pitched-up vocals and DIY production. At best, like the EP’s weirdest track, Kalm, the music departs from traditional song structure and coalesces into delay-steeped, swirling ambience.

He doesn’t share his real name and often performs masked, channelling a healthy dollop of Dean Blunt in both vibe and sound. His most immediate peers, though, might be his fellow UK vanguards Worldpeace DMT, Westside Cowboy and Aya. His witty realism cuts through in a crowded scene: new song Theres No Such Thing as England subtly riffs on the country’s growing right-wing nationalism as a metaphor for jilted romance and suburban bleakness – “There’s no such thing as England / There’s no such thing as us to me” – while A Weekend in Majorca lets those same feelings dissolve on a classic package holiday: “I’m a lover, I’m a brawler / For a weekend in Majorca.”

His descriptions of cold nights, broken-down cars, weird neighbours and teenage escapism all feel foggily familiar – attempts to reconfigure the frayed edges of memory from nostalgia into something new. Archie Forde

This week’s best new tracks

View image in fullscreen Hen Ogledd: Rhodri Davies, Dawn Bothwell, Sally Pilkington and Richard Dawson.

Hen Ogledd – Scales Will Fall

Featuring a splenetic rap from Dawn Bothwell that decries today’s political leadership as feudal, followed by the heartiest of choruses and a bracing trumpet freakout, this is an invigorating anthem from the UK psych-poppers. BBT

Fine – Moment

“Sometimes I call you up in the moment,” the Dane sings, impetuously – but her slowcore, country-Mazzy Star-ish ballad, made for the final souls on the dancefloor, burns steadier, waiting for them to come to her. LS

Tems – What You Need

The Nigerian star lets the astonishing timbre of her voice sit out front in this ballad as she calls time on a crisis-strewn relationship: “Your love is like an endless sea: it won’t lead me anywhere.” BBT

Lucinda Williams – We’ve Come Too Far to Turn Around (ft Norah Jones)

The union of these two powerhouse singers suggests an Americana take on VH1’s old Divas format, as they warble about straying from the path to choogling Hammond organ and stately piano. LS

Converge – Love is Not Enough

The returning metalcore pioneers argue for a more combative, less doveish attitude when dealing with society’s ghouls, but don’t shy from self-examination either: “We must grow to stomach the taste of our own blood”​. BBT

Haley Heynderickx and Max García Conover – To Each Their Dot

“And if I look at you and your rage as testicular / Humanity’s best interest is circular,” Heynderickx sings, tempering her rage in this folksy lament about man acting against his best interest. LS

Svalbard – If We Could Still Be Saved

After terrific albums such as The Weight of the Mask and When I Die, Will I Get Better?, this metalcore epic is the Bristol band’s final song. “Think of it as the metal version of Goodbye by the Spice Girls!”, says frontwoman Serena Cherry. BBT

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/24/cop30-wrecked-fossil-fuels-russia-saudi-arabia-brazil,Another Cop wrecked by fossil fuel interests and our leaders’ cowardice – but there is another way | Genevieve Guenther,"The 30th conference of the parties (Cop30), the annual climate summit of all nations party to the UNFCCC, just ended. Stakeholders are out in the media trying spin the outcome as a win. Simon Stiell, climate change executive secretary for the UN is, for instance, praising Cop30 for showing that “climate cooperation is alive and kicking, keeping humanity in the fight for a liveable planet”. But let us be clear. The conference was a failure. Its outcome, the decision text known as the Global Mutirão or Global Collective Effort, is, in essence, a form of climate denial.

In 2023, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) determined that the world had already developed, or planned to develop, too much fossil fuel to be able to halt global heating at 2C. It acknowledged that the capital assets built up around fossil fuels must be stranded – that is to say, abandoned and not used – if warming was to be limited to 2C. But the Cop30 decision text ignores all this. Indeed, it never even mentions fossil fuels.

This failure is all the more bitter because Cop30 had initially sent out so many hopeful signals that it would finally tackle the “transitioning away from fossil fuels” pledge from Cop28. Speaking ahead of the conference, the Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, said that the world needs “roadmaps that will enable humankind, in a fair and planned manner, to overcome its dependence on fossil fuels”.

Lula’s call was backed by about 90 other nations. “This is a global coalition, with global north and global south countries coming together and saying with one voice: this is an issue which cannot be swept under the carpet,” said the UK’s energy secretary, Ed Miliband.

After a press conference where 20 ministers and climate envoys demanded that the proposed language on the roadmap in the first draft text be “strengthened” and adopted, the EU circulated its own proposal for incorporating the roadmap in the final text.

By Friday, the number of countries supporting the roadmap to fossil-fuel phaseout rose to 89. Yet any reference to it disappeared from the second draft that dropped on the same day. Thanks to Cop30, the fossil fuel era will simply continue.

It seems clear that the petrostates, led by Russia and Saudi Arabia, fought against fossil fuel phaseout and won. If they feel the phaseout is an existential threat to their economies and their sovereignty, perhaps they should consider how the climate crisis is rendering the Middle East uninhabitable. The very week of Cop30, Iran’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, announced that Tehran, Iran’s capital city of 16 million, would need to be abandoned and re-established elsewhere, because, after years of climate-fuelled drought, its water has finally run out.

Surely these states are being supported in their fossil-fuel authoritarianism by Donald Trump, who is the president of the world’s largest producer of fossil fuels and who calls the climate crisis a “con job”. Even though the US was officially absent from the negotiations, Trump’s alliance with Saudi Arabia, and seeming affinity for Russia, underwrites their ability to advance their own energy interests.

Yet would this power be as great if the world’s “climate leaders” had more courage? It is remarkable that at the very moment the EU was supposedly fighting to include a roadmap to fossil fuel phaseout in the Cop decision, Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, was telling a press conference at the G20 that “we are not fighting fossil fuels, we are fighting the emissions from fossil fuels.” Not only does this statement directly undermine her own negotiators’ positions, it is in itself nonsensical – akin to saying “we are not giving up eating ice-cream, we are giving up absorbing the calories from that ice-cream.”

More to the point, von der Leyen’s language echoed nearly verbatim the words of Osama Faqeeha, deputy environment minister for Saudi Arabia, who told a journalist asking about the Cop30 roadmap that “the issue is the emissions, it’s not the fuel”. It has long been the position of the Saudis that the world could continue to use fossil fuels and simply remove the economy’s 600m metric tonnes of annual carbon-dioxide emissions with carbon-dioxide removal. But this is nothing more than fossil-fuel propaganda.

For one thing, the amount of CO2 that can be stored safely underground is limited. That the president of the commission repeats such nonsense reveals why attempts like Cop30 repeatedly fail: so-called climate leaders in fact evince deep ambivalence about phasing out fossil fuels, ultimately unifying global climate politics around the lie that we can keep using fossil fuels and still deal with the climate crisis.

But what of China? Isn’t China becoming the world’s first electrostate, stepping into the role of global climate leader with the US embracing fossil authoritarianism? Well, China seems to be ambivalent too, at least for now. China did not block the text on the roadmap to fossil-fuel phaseout, but neither did it fight to make sure it was included. Despite its dominance in solar, wind and electric vehicles, China acts less as a climate leader and more as an “all of the above” energy powerhouse, devoted first and foremost to its own economic development.

One bright spot of Cop30 is that Colombia and the Netherlands, backed by 22 nations, will independently advance a roadmap to fossil fuel phaseout, beginning with a conference in April 2026. This conference could be a gamechanger. UN rules require all Cop decision texts to be approved unanimously, giving the petrostates veto power over global climate politics. The creation of a fossil-fuel roadmap outside the Cop process may establish a trading bloc that could begin to sanction nations – and banks – that refuse to wind down fossil fuels.

Such a bloc will have no power if its leaders are not forced to resolve their ambivalence about phasing out fossil fuels. And that’s where you and I come in. All of us must do our part and subject world leaders to extreme and relentless public pressure. The challenge of stranding potentially trillions of dollars in fossil capital and rebuilding the world is enormous. Of course, global leaders and officials will take the easier, cowardly road if they can get away with it. As we cross the 1.5C threshold into uncharted climatic territory, we must make them fight wholeheartedly for fossil fuel phaseout. In the end, it is up to us to create a global politics that will finally save the world for our children.",2025-11-24 00:00:00,literal,Factual reporting on reporting and data,literal,literal,0,literal,0.9679391,0.03206098,0.9679391,True

I’ve been talking to trend forecasters, supply chain managers, economists and consumer behavior specialists for weeks, and they have one main piece of advice for shoppers: hurry. Experts say items will likely go out of stock quickly this year due to limited inventory, and while prices may not drop as low as usual due to tariffs, there’s plenty of worthwhile discounts out there. The sooner you shop, the more options you’ll get to browse through, and the longer you'll have to compare prices across retailers, weigh shipping options and hunt for coupons.

This is my sixth year covering Black Friday for NBC Select, so I know how to find deals that are actually worth buying. I spent weeks combing through thousands of discounts to find the best early Black Friday deals— each one I recommend below is highly rated and 20% off or more. When possible, I ran deals through price trackers to make sure they’re at their lowest price in at least three months or the lowest price ever. I’ll frequently update this list leading up to Black Friday.

“I use this gel moisturizer on nights when my face is feeling particularly dry and I wake up the next day with soft, hydrated skin,” says NBC Select editorial projects manager Rebecca Rodriguez. “The thick jelly texture means a little goes a long way, so I spread a thin layer across my face and can still feel it in the morning.” The cream is made with collagen to firm and plumpen skin, as well as moisturizing ingredients like niacinamide, squalane and hyaluronic acid.

The NBC Select staff agrees that Legos are one of the best gifts for all ages — it’s an engaging, screen-free activity, and once you’re done with a build, it becomes a piece of home (or desk) decor. This set comes with pieces to make three mini bonsai trees: a ginkgo, a black pine and a wisteria tree. Lego recommends it for those ages 18 and up, and one to three people can construct the trees together.

NBC Select tech reporter Harry Rabinowitz says the Apple AirPods 4 are one of the best pairs of noise-cancelling earbuds you can buy if you own an iPhone. “They have a semi-open fit, meaning no rubber eartips, so you can hear the world around you (and your music, of course),” he says. “They’re also small, lightweight and sync easily across all your Apple devices.” You get up to 30 hours of battery life with the included charging case, and Siri virtual assistant is built in, so you can change the song, adjust volume, make calls and send texts completely hands-free. The AirPods are also sweat- and water-resistant, according to the brand.

Rodriguez is a former preschool teacher, and she says Magna-Tiles were the number one toy her students fought over. I’ve played with them myself while babysitting and can attest that they’re always a crowd-pleaser. This set comes with 32 magnetic blocks in square and triangular shapes, in a rainbow of colors. Kids can use them to make 3D and 2D structures.

The Birdie comes with a replaceable battery that lasts for up to 40 minutes of use, according to the brand.

Samsonite makes some of the most durable luggage I’ve ever used — no matter how much I beat it up while traveling, it still works perfectly and looks pristine.

They both have a scratch-resistant hard outer shell, 360-degree spinner wheels and internal organization systems.

Yeti drinkware is a popular gift in my family, and I’ve personally received this tumbler because my loved ones know how often I take my iced coffee and smoothies on the go. The 42-ounce, dishwasher-safe cup is made from stainless steel and has double-wall vacuum insulation, which helps keep drinks hot or cold for hours, in my experience. The large handle makes the tumbler easy to hold, its base is cup holder-compatible and it comes with a straw lid that you can take apart for easy cleaning. I also appreciate that the exterior of the cup doesn’t produce condensation, so whatever surface I put it on stays dry.

4.2-star average rating from 6,470 reviews on Amazon

""I’ve had the Oura Ring for a little over a year and I use it every single day,"" says NBC Select updates editor Mili Godio.

We recommend Brooklinen's Classic Percale sheets for hot sleepers because they have a cool, crisp feel, but almost everyone on our team likes using them. This set comes with a flat sheet, fitted sheet and pillowcases. You can buy it in twin to California king sizes.

4.2-star average rating from 119 reviews at Nordstrom

The Hoka Gaviota 5 is currently discounted across retailers in men’s and women’s sizes, and it’s one of our favorite walking shoes and running shoes with arch support.

You can remove the sneakers’ insoles to add orthotics.

4.9-star average rating from 1,237 reviews at Calpak

“I bring almost my entire bathroom with me while traveling, and this cosmetic case is one of the only ones that can handle my excess of products,” says Rodriguez. “When I first used it, I was dumbfounded by how much of my makeup and skin care fit inside. It also feels luxe with its faux-leather exterior and gold zippers.” Since the cosmetics case is clear, you can always see what’s inside and easily wipe it down to clean as needed. It also comes in tiny, small and large sizes, all of which are on sale.

4.4-star average rating from 17 reviews at Hanna Andersson

I like to think of myself as somewhat of a pajama set connoisseur, and out of all the options I own, Hanna Andersson’s are my all-time favorite. I’ve bought them for adults and kids in my life, especially if I’m struggling with a gift idea, and there are lots of options if you’re looking for matching holiday pajamas the whole family can wear. This set is made from lightweight, buttery soft, moisture-wicking fabric and the top and bottoms both have a relaxed fit with piping detail. They fit true to size, in my experience.

NBC News Think,https://www.nbcnews.com/sports/mlb/mets-rangers-reportedly-agree-to-brandon-nimmo-marcus-semien-trade-roster-impact-fantasy-fallout-ncna1417069,"Mets, Rangers reportedly agree to Brandon Nimmo/Marcus Semien trade: Roster impact, fantasy fallout","The New York Mets claimed they wanted to improve their team defense this offseason, and they took a big step towards doing that on Sunday, acquiring 2025 Gold Gove second baseman Marcus Semien from the Rangers for outfielder Brandon Nimmo.

BREAKING: The New York Mets and Texas Rangers are finalizing a trade that would send second baseman Marcus Semien to the Mets and outfielder Brandon Nimmo to the Rangers, sources tell ESPN — Jeff Passan (@JeffPassan) November 23, 2025

The trade still needs to be approved by Major League Baseball, but it appears to be a one-for-one trade for now. The deal was also contingent on Nimmo waiving his no-trade clause, but it’s been reported that Nimmo did do that to facilitate the trade.

Nimmo, who had a full no-trade clause, has approved the deal, league sources said. https://t.co/7nHKBvePw0 — Will Sammon (@WillSammon) November 23, 2025

Why would the Mets make this trade?

Semien, 35, is coming off one of the worst offensive seasons of his career and is due $72 million over the next three years. In that sense, you can see why the Rangers wanted to move on from Semien, but perhaps not why the Mets wanted to acquire him.

Semien has now seen his offensive production decline in each of the last two seasons in terms of power production, contact rate, and swinging strike rate. Over the last two seasons, he’s been challenged with far more sinkers and cutters, and pitchers appear to be effectively getting in on his hands. His infield fly ball rate, which was 7.6% in 2023 and 8.5% in 2022, skyrocketed to 13.8% in 2024 and 13.1% in 2025.

Semien is still making above-average contact overall and has remained consistent with a barrel rate around 6.6%, so there is an argument that he could be closer to a .250 hitter with 15+ home runs and 10+ steals. While that is not exciting on the surface, it’s better than what he produced last year.

However, the reason the Mets wanted to make this deal is for defensive purposes. Semien still produced an Outs Above Average of 7 last season and remains a solid defender at second base. Semien would be a significant improvement there on players like Jeff McNeil or Brett Baty and would create a strong double play combo up the middle with shortstop Francisco Lindor. The deal also removes Nimmo from the outfield, where he posted a -1 Outs Above Average on the season, and allows the Mets to improve their outfield defense as well.

It seems that the Mets were happy to take an offensive hit for the potential defensive gain. The club also has more flexibility for their offseason plans for the outfield, which again, could be an upgrade to Nimmo defensively.

Why would the Rangers make this trade?

Offensively speaking, Nimmo was clearly superior to Semien last year. He hit .262/.324/.436 with 25 home runs and 13 steals. It seems likely that the Rangers would use Nimmo as their primary left fielder, which means he’d be replacing the non-tendered Adolis Garcia, who posted a .227/.271/.394 line last year with 19 home runs and a 24.7% strikeout rate. That’s an improvement in almost all facets.

The Rangers could also choose to use Nimmo at designated hitter and play Alejandro Osuna in the outfield with Wyatt Langford and Evan Carter.

Nimmo is due $102.5 million over the next five seasons, which is a significant contract for the Rangers to take on, but they clearly believe Nimmo is a better fit at the top of their lineup than Semien.

What’s the fantasy baseball impact?

It’s hard to see much of a change for Semien. He goes from hitting at the top of a good lineup in a pitcher’s park to hitting atop a good lineup in a modest pitcher’s park. Yes, in some respects, Citi Field is better for right-handed hitters, but in terms of just hits for right-handed hitters, Globe Life Field ranked 23rd and Citi Field ranked 26th, according to Statcast Park Factors. Citi Field does rank 7th for right-handed pull power, but Globe Life was 10th, so, again, it’s just a modest upgrade. If anything, you’d wonder if the fresh start gives him a mild boost.

Same goes for Nimmo. Citi Field and Globe Life are nearly identical in park factors for left-handed hitters. Globe Life does rank 12th for left-handed pull power while Citi Field ranks 16th, so it’s a mild improvement. However, you could make the argument that the Rangers’ lineup is slightly worse than the Mets.

Editor's Note: This review discusses suicide.

How can poetry help us now, when practically every morning brings a fresh assault on knowledge, wisdom and safety? Amid the cruel political discourse horrifying headlines that seem to envelop everything, where is there a place for poetry? What can a bunch of artfully arranged words do?

A lot, I'd argue.

Words are among the many things under attack. Our stories, the ways that we fill our words with our own meanings, are more precious and urgent than ever, as three new books this fall by poets in – or entering – mid-career make clear. They lay claim to stories of identity, suffering and hope, to a kind of collective subjectivity, to the inner life of a country in the throes of deep pain and uncertainty. Here's a look:

Blue Opening by Chet'la Sebree

Chet'la Sebree's third book begins with the thwarted wish to have a child: ""Many in my family have been plagued/ by menorrhagia in early middle age--/ fibrinous weeds causing their bodies to bleed streams,/ flooding lands no longer suitable for plants.""

What follows is a rapidly paced, heart-stricken coming to terms with a body and a future suddenly altered by autoimmune disease, with the meanings of motherhood and daughterhood, and with the stunned language required to describe it all when there is ""no one to know/ my body's vernacular, that it would mistake me for foreigner.""

Blindingly clear and unornamented, these poems have all their cards on the table, ""pregnant with grief—/ it's bloated, black, a matted thatch."" If the body is in revolt — ""I am not the owner of this vessel I thought I owned, implies the man trying to sell it to me"" — then it is through language that Sebree can lay claim to herself, to her story, and take it back.

The lexicons of motherhood and illness (""I accept this list of words:// necrotizing lymphadenitis and swell-scrambled nerves"") become a vocabulary of grief and profound disappointment with what may and may not be possible. Sebree searches for language to carry the grief and to promise some kind of hope and inner rebirth; she finds a surprising kind of peace and power ""when a centrifuge spins/ my blood 3,000 revolutions per minute/ to render me perhaps anew to me again."" A new kind of creation becomes possible, as well, through poetry.

The Seeds by Cecily Parks

With The Seeds, her third book, Cecily Parks comes into her full powers. These poems are dark, lavish, far-reaching and subtly layered, making a harsh and rich mirror of the pastoral and the domestic. Parks reckons with the compromises that every life demands, that motherhood and art demand, that a country where violence and cruelty are suddenly triumphant require: ""now I think of hope// as a swing chained to a branch./ it can be used until/ the branch sweeps the ground/ with a shush shush because/ it cannot bear/ so much weight and still loft through/ the dream-trafficked air.""

Parks' powers of description are breathtaking, not only because one feels transported but also because, as in the poems of Elizabeth Bishop, the emotion, the domestic or personal story, is interwoven into – always an undercurrent of, a reason for – the description. But somehow, the world as described also feels like the world, not a projection. In these poems, Parks feels with her eyes.

The writing is simply beautiful: ""the grackles plummet down to pierce the lawn/ for seeds and fat brown live oak acorns."" The words dart in and out of the rhythm like the grackles' dark beaks, making gentle animals of a mother and her ""ravenous daughters."" This book is a delight, a feast of grief and determined celebration. A fallen world this lovingly observed must be at least somewhat redeemed.

The New Economy by Gabrielle Calvocoressi

Hopelessness is a beloved enemy in these poems, a necessary muse. So are grief and fear. ""The days I don't want to kill myself/ are extraordinary,"" begins the most affirming poem about suicide I've ever read. But these are not merely affirming poems (though one of them is titled ""Affirmation Cistern When I Let Go of My Fear Life Becomes Magical""). Calvocoressi is at home in the dark, they live there, even if light is their element. They're wise because they're wary: ""every being will slaughter/ their neighbor if they're hungry,/ and enough.""

All of our violence, they assert – with a compassion so pure it feels out of step with the times – is born of fear: ""when I was little I wanted/ to be tough to beat people up to own a gun./ wanted the boy body that would keep my body/ from being so scared."" Violence begins in each of us, is always inflicted first upon ourselves. And yet, we persist, try to do better – we must.

A series of ""Miss You"" poems, high-energy elegies for loved ones who have died, celebrate life emphatically by not quite letting go of the past: ""miss you in your puffy blue jacket./ They're hip now. I can bring you a new one/ if only you'll come by. Know I told you /it was okay to go. Know I told you it was okay/ to leave me./ Why'd you believe me?"" Why let the past go? Where else do we live but our stories? Where else can we rest from the terrors of the present? Where else can we remind ourselves of the beauty of the world?

This is the very first K-pop band to play behind the Tiny Desk. SEVENTEEN's name comes from an equation: 13 members + 3 teams + 1 group. Those three teams focus on hip-hop, vocal and performance to come together as one. SEVENTEEN (SVT for short) recently celebrated its 10th anniversary with a world tour, performing in big stadiums for millions of fans (aka Carats). After their last U.S. concert in Washington, D.C., five of the members stopped by the NPR Music office to play in front of what's likely their smallest audience ever.

Bred from an industry that's all about a polished look and sound, these members put a lot of trust into our Tiny Desk team to be vulnerable in our space. Just like most artists that play our series, they were nervous, but you can see how much fun Dino, Seungkwan, Joshua, Vernon and Mingyu (from left to right) have as they casually talk between songs. It also doesn't hurt that the crowd — filled with screaming fans — made them feel at ease. SEVENTEEN's set features a medley of old and new songs, which is the perfect sampling of its extensive catalog, ending strong with ""VERY NICE.""

DK was scheduled to participate but sadly he lost his voice days before this concert. We were devastated, but it's important to note how Joshua, Mingyu, Seungkwan, Vernon and Dino not only learned DK's parts quickly, but executed them flawlessly. It wasn't easy for them to change the arrangements of the songs just one day before the shoot. Despite the absence of DK and the other members, we think the show turned out really well and are grateful to have hosted the members for this special show.

Bob Trumpy, who died this week at the age of 80, was an All-Pro tight end for the Cincinnati Bengals, then took his booming voice and blunt opinions into broadcasting.

He had a show called Sportstalk on Cincinnati's WLW Radio. Sports radio can be loud and raucous, blaring with bluster and bellowing. ""Can you believe that? What were they thinking?""

But one night in 1983, the first person to call in said her name was Sugar. She said she had been drinking, and was married to a man who beat her. She said that she hadn't worked for more than a decade and could not support her 19-year-old son. And, Sugar said, she wanted to end her life.

""I don't know why she called a sports talk show,"" Trumpy told the Los Angeles Times, years later. ""It was probably just the first number she heard on the radio and decided to call it.""

And he kept Sugar talking, and safe — live, on the air — for two and a half hours.

""It would be a shame for you to check out by yourself when you like people so much,"" Bob Trumpy told her, according to an Associated Press story about the call. ""This is a cry for help, and I'm not going to let that go unheard.""

Sugar's son finally came on the line and revealed where they lived. Emergency workers were able to reach her before she harmed herself.

Trumpy received praise for how he handled Sugar's call, but the experience jarred him. ""I sure didn't feel like a hero after that,"" he told the Los Angeles Times years later. ""She wasn't the only one who had to go to a crisis center for therapy. So did I.""

Trumpys' grandfather had taken his own life when Trumpy was six years old. After his conversation with Sugar, he told the Cincinnati Post, ""I kept seeing my grandfather in his coffin.""

He would go on to announce NFL games, Super Bowls, and the Olympics for NBC Sports. But the broadcast of Trumpy's life was the night he stayed on the line for hours with a stranger who needed help.

NBC News Think,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/markets/stocks-rally-fed-rate-cut-ai-companies-rcna245722,Stocks rally on rising hopes for December rate cut and renewed AI enthusiasm,"Stocks rallied on Monday as investors digested fresh comments from top Fed officials and AI companies rebounded from last week.

The S&P 500 ended the day higher by 1.6%. The Nasdaq Composite wrapped the trading day up 2.7%, its best day since May. The S&P 500 came within striking distance of achieving the same feat earlier in the session.

The rally came after two top Fed officials voiced support for an interest rate cut at the central bank's next rate-setting meetings, slated for Dec. 9 and 10.

Mary Daly, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, told The Wall Street Journal that she supported lowering rates due to the ""vulnerable"" labor market. While Daly is not a current voting member of the Fed's Open Market Committee,"" she has rarely taken a public position at odds with Fed Chair Jerome Powell,"" the Journal noted.

Federal Reserve Governor Christoper Waller, who has a permanent vote on interest rates, also voiced concern about the labor market on Fox Business Network.

""My concern is mainly [the] labor market in terms of our dual mandate,"" Waller said. ""So I’m advocating for a rate cut at the next meeting.""

While Waller has been advocating for a cut for months, his and Daly's views come as markets try to work out how the upcoming Fed meeting will go. In recent days, markets viewed a rate cut as unlikely amid a wave of cautious comments from Fed officials.

That all changed on Friday, when New York Fed President John Williams signaled his support for a cut and sent the chance of a rate cut soaring to around 60%. Williams also serves as vice chair of the Fed's rate-setting committee.

As of Monday afternoon, odds of a cut sat above 85%, according to the CME Group's FedWatch, which tracks bets that traders place in the futures market on where they see interest rates going.

Markets are closely tracking Fed officials because lower interest rates tend to lower borrowing costs, boosting corporate profits and therefore stock market returns.

Meanwhile, a sharp rebound in megacap tech stocks also pushed indexes higher. Apple and Nvidia rose around 2%, Amazon shares jumped 2.5% and Alphabet shares surged 6.3%.

Last week, Alphabet's Google division announced a new AI model called Gemini 3.

Chipmakers for AI devices and services also saw broad enthusiasm.

Al Jazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/11/19/true-climate-justice-demands-a-reckoning-with-colonialism,True climate justice demands a reckoning with colonialism,"The African Union declared 2025 to be the “Year of Justice for Africans and People of African Descent through Reparations”. The African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights has an opportunity to make that more than just a slogan, as it considers the current request for an advisory opinion before it, on states’ human rights obligations in the context of climate change. It has an opportunity to issue a landmark opinion affirming the link between colonialism and the harms of climate change to people(s) across the continent. Such an opinion would mark a major step forward from the International Court of Justice and in Africa’s fight for reparative justice.

On July 30, 2025, Amnesty International published a report recounting how, during the French colonial era in Madagascar, authorities deliberately unleashed harmful, genetically manipulated cochineal parasites across some 40,000 hectares (98,850 acres) of a drought-resilient vegetation in the Androy region in Madagascar’s deep South. Between 1924 and 1929, the parasites destroyed roughly 100km (62 miles) of vegetation cover each year.

This was not a minor ecological loss. The vegetation had sustained the Antandroy people for generations, providing food and helping to preserve groundwater through chronic droughts. Its destruction erased a vital natural defence system against those droughts. More than a century later, the destruction has left the Antandroy people exposed to recurring mass hunger, displacement, and death whenever drought strikes.

Furthermore, Madagascar’s droughts are being intensified by human-induced climate change, driven largely by high-income historically high emitting countries, such as France – the very colonial power that left the Antandroy people vulnerable.

When science leads and politics lags

The scientific link between colonialism and climate vulnerability has long been established. In 2022, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which advises the United Nations on the science related to climate change, highlighted not only how colonialism contributed to the climate crisis itself but also how its enduring harms have left many communities in former colonies more vulnerable to climate effects, such as droughts, floods, cyclones and rising sea levels.

Effective climate action needs more than science; it also requires political backing for states, particularly those with greater historic responsibility for climate change, to act on mitigation, adaptation and financing strategies. When this doesn’t happen, countries with minimal historical responsibility who are suffering the most from climate change have no option but to seek clarity and accountability through a world court, in this case, the International Court of Justice (ICJ). The ICJ has the capacity to influence political processes. The ICJ, in particular, can lend global legitimacy to scientific evidence. Indeed, the ICJ has considerable moral and persuasive authority, often shaping the behaviour of states on the international political stage.

The opportunity for the ICJ to exert this influence arrived when in March 2023 Vanuatu, itself a former colony of both France and the United Kingdom, rallied the UN General Assembly to request an ICJ advisory opinion on states’ legal obligations regarding climate change. Formerly colonised nations in Africa and elsewhere joined the effort, many explicitly highlighting how colonial harms and climate injustices are interconnected.

When the ICJ delivered its opinion in July 2025, there was a glaring omission. The word “colonialism” appeared nowhere in relation to climate change, neither in the main opinion nor in the 12 separate opinions and declarations issued by its judges. The ICJ also sidestepped a critical question: how far back in time can claims for climate obligations reach? This question is crucial, because former colonial powers often claim that colonialism was not prohibited under international law when it was practised and, therefore, no legal obligation to provide reparations exists. They also often defend their role in causing climate change by arguing that they were unaware of the harm and faced no legal limits on greenhouse gas emissions until recently.

Customary international law shatters the colonial defence

Despite its regrettable silence on the question of colonialism, the ICJ offered some reassurances to countries that are bearing the combined consequences of colonialism and climate change by affirming that states’ climate change obligations are not confined to climate treaties. They also flow from customary international law, which dictates that a state’s responsibility can extend into the present if a wrongful act continues to affect the enjoyment of human rights, regardless of when that act originally occurred.

Engaging customary international law is significant because it reshapes the question that any Court ought to ask about colonial climate legacies. In this context, the relevant question is not whether states can be held accountable for the intertwined impacts of colonialism and climate change. Nor is it how far back we should look to assign responsibility for greenhouse gas emissions, which linger in the atmosphere for centuries. The question is: are harms rooted in the colonial era, including those that shape climate vulnerability, causing human rights violations today?

The simple answer is yes. The greenhouse gases now heating our planet and fuelling a cascade of rights violations have been trapped in the atmosphere for generations. They are the direct legacy of the fossil fuel burning that powered the industrial rise of former colonial powers since the 1750s and their post World War I & II economic recovery. In Madagascar, the French colonial administration’s destruction of the drought-resilient vegetation that had long sustained the Antandroy people stripped them of their natural defence against recurring droughts. This forced them into dependence and cheap labour within the colonial cash-crop economy. All this helped expand the forging of Europe’s economic paths and markets, which were powered by the burning of fossil fuels, releasing unprecedented quantities of greenhouse gases, which caused climate change.

The ICJ’s half measure: Opening the door, then closing it

By affirming that customary international law can ground claims for climate-related reparations, the ICJ appeared to open the door for climate demands tied to colonial harms. Yet, in the same opinion, the ICJ reinforced one of the very arguments long used by those who benefited from colonialism to reject responsibility.

The ICJ stated that full reparation — through restitution, compensation or satisfaction — is possible only when a “sufficiently direct and certain causal link” can be proven between the wrongful act and the injury. But making such a definitive link between innumerable acts of colonial violence and the impacts they had in exacerbating climate-change vulnerability is nearly impossible.

The requirement of such a definitive link as a precondition for colonial reparations, without qualifying how it could practically work for colonialism and climate change impacts, provides cover to countries like France. In Madagascar’s case, for instance, the French government could easily argue: “It has been a century since the colonial destruction of drought-resistant vegetation, and factors like population growth have played a role and the act of greenhouse gas emissions and destruction of ecosystems was not regarded as a violation. How can France be held legally responsible and realistically be expected to quantify reparations today?” As UN experts have observed, “the greatest barrier to reparations for colonialism and slavery is that the principal beneficiaries of both lack the political will and moral courage to make them a reality.”

Will the African court echo the ICJ’s silence, or break it?

Since May 2025, the African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights has been reviewing a request for an advisory opinion on the human and peoples’ rights obligations of African states in the context of climate change. This is more than a procedural exercise. The request highlights the relationship between climate change and colonialism – a point that human rights actors intend to emphasise in their submissions before the court.

This is therefore a chance for the Court to articulate what the ICJ would not: that the fight for climate justice is inextricably linked with Africa’s fight for reparative justice. Such a stance would lay bare the plight of those still suffering the intersecting harms of colonialism and climate change such as the Antandroy. It would contribute to breathing life into the Year of Reparations and align with the African Commission’s 2022 Resolution on Africa’s Reparations Agenda, which provides the African Court a mechanism through which to push African states to pursue justice for the trade and trafficking of enslaved Africans, colonialism and colonial crimes, and racial segregation. The possibilities remain open. It may also encourage them to return to the ICJ to give the world court an opportunity to redeem itself.

When President Trump welcomed Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to the Oval Office this week, a reporter asked about Jamal Khashoggi. The Saudi journalist was murdered in 2018, according to U.S. intelligence agencies, in an operation approved by the Crown Prince.

""You're mentioning somebody that was extremely controversial,"" the president replied. ""A lot of people didn't like that gentleman that you're talking about. Whether you like him or didn't like him, things happen.""

Jamal Khashoggi came from a prominent Saudi family but fled his country in June, 2017, after he'd become increasingly critical of his government. He said he'd been banned from using Twitter.

He began to write columns for The Washington Post with a candid admission:

""It was painful for me several years ago when several friends were arrested,"" he wrote. ""I said nothing. I didn't want to lose my job or my freedom. I worried about my family. I have made a different choice now. I have left my home, my family and my job, and I am raising my voice. To do otherwise would betray those who languish in prison. I can speak when so many cannot.""

The following summer, the Crown Prince lifted the traditional ban on women driving. But first his government arrested numerous women's rights advocates, accusing them of ""nefarious contacts with foreign parties.""

""The message is clear to all,"" wrote Khashoggi. ""Activism of any sort has to be within the government, and no independent voice or counter-opinion will be allowed. Everyone must stick to the party line.""

Just a few months after he wrote those words, Khashoggi entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul to pick up documents for his marriage. His fiancée waited outside for him, for hours. Khashoggi never got out of that building.

But his voice went on. His last column, published after his death, called for free expression in the Arab world, and warned that the region's governments ""have been given free rein to continue silencing the media.""

""The Shipping Forecast,"" presented twice on weekdays on the BBC and thrice on weekends, is 100-years-old this week.

It broadcasts weather forecasts for the seas that surround the British Isles.

You may wonder: why don't sailors and citizens on the North and Irish Seas, and along the English Channel, just look at their iPhones for the weather? They probably do.

But the two-minute program is heard by 6.5 million people. That is more than the nightly audience for Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Kimmel, and Jimmy Fallon combined.

""The Shipping Forecast"" is a fixture of British life. It has been featured in songs from Radiohead, Arctic Monkeys, and Chumbawamba, and satirized by British comics and on TikTok. Seamus Heaney saluted the show in his poem ""The Shipping Forecast,"" in which he wrote, ""… Green, swift upsurges, North Atlantic flux, Conjured by that strong gale-warning voice …""

Are your eyelids growing heavy?

But the persistence of ""The Shipping Forecast"" may remind us of how the human voice, even crackling through static, can fire up images, memories, and feelings.

When Nite Yun cooks, she's telling her family's story.

The Cambodian-American chef, best known for her restaurant Lunette in San Francisco, has long used food to honor her parents' country. But as she was growing up in Stockton, Calif., her parents rarely talked about their life in Cambodia and the genocide they fled in the 1970s.

""My parents dodged landmines, survived starvation, forced labor camps, walked under the hot, hot sun to safety,"" Yun told NPR's Leila Fadel.

It was in the kitchen that she began to piece their story together.

""Cooking Cambodian food has been a way of storytelling,"" she said.

Now Yun is sharing those stories and her recipes with the world in her debut cookbook called My Cambodia: A Khmer Cookbook.

""My Cambodia is my story. My parents' story of resilience and strength,"" she said. ""I also wanted people to not forget the good times of Cambodia when my parents were growing up.""

Among the dishes she features is kroeung, a fragrant herb paste that forms the base of Khmer cooking. Made from lemongrass, galangal, turmeric, garlic, shallots and lime leaves, kroeung is used in soups, stews and curry. Yun shared a recipe for kroeung with Morning Edition, which you can find below. As she writes, ""you simply cannot talk about or cook Khmer food without it.

MASTER KROEUNG

toggle caption Nicola Parisi/Ten Speed Press

Makes 2 cups

8 large or 12 small lemongrass stalks, trimmed and thinly sliced (2 cups)

3-inch piece galangal, thinly sliced (1/2 cup)

1/2 cup chopped garlic (15 to 25 cloves, 1 to 2 heads garlic)

1 small shallot, chopped (1/4 cup)

10 makrut lime leaves, center veins removed, thinly sliced

Place the lemongrass in a mortar and smash it into a paste with the pestle (see Note). Add the galangal and smash it with the lemongrass until it has the consistency of a paste. Add the garlic and smash, then repeat with the shallot. Finally, add the lime leaves a little bit at a time, smashing as you go. The ingredients should barely come together into a paste.

Sponsor Message

To finish, stir everything together. Doesn't it smell lovely? It's ready to use. To store, refrigerate the kroeung in an airtight container for up to 3 days. To freeze, portion the kroeung into ½-cup containers or resealable bags. It'll keep for up to 2 months.

Note: The key to great kroeung is in the smashing of the ingredients. Crushing each ingredient in the mortar will break down the fibers and release aromatic oils and flavors in a way that tearing and shredding will not. That said, if you don't have a mortar and pestle, a food processor is the next best thing: Place all the ingredients in the bowl of the processor and pulse several times until it turns into a paste. If the ingredients aren't combining, add a little bit of grapeseed or another neutral oil to help things move along.

The man, an older adult with underlying health conditions, was being treated for a bird flu called H5N5 after becoming seemingly the first known human infected by the strain, according to a statement from the Washington State Department of Health.

The man from Grays Harbor County, about 78 miles southwest of Seattle, had a backyard flock of domestic poultry that had been exposed to wild birds, health officials said.

“The risk to the public remains low,” the statement from state health officials said. “No other people involved have tested positive for avian influenza.”

Health officials said they will monitor anyone who came in close contact with the man, but “there is no evidence of transmission of this virus between people.”

Earlier this month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a statement about the infection that said no information would suggest “the risk to public health has increased as a result of this case.”

H5N5 is not believed to be a greater threat to human health than the H5N1 virus behind a wave of 70 reported human infections in the U.S. in 2024 and 2025. Most of those have been mild illnesses in workers on dairy and poultry farms.

The distinction between H5N5 and H5N1 lies in a protein involved in releasing the virus from an infected cell and promoting spread to surrounding cells.",2025-11-22 04:44:26.158000+00:00,metaphor,Wave of used as metaphor for series or trend,metaphor,figurative,1,literal,0.9827001,0.017299917,0.9827001,False

As in August, when the US president invited Vladimir Putin to a summit in Alaska, Kyiv and its European allies were excluded from discussions that ended up echoing Kremlin talking points. Yet again, Mr Trump publicly scolded Volodymyr Zelenskyy for not being more grateful for his ongoing mediation efforts. And as in the summer, Mr Zelenskyy and blindsided European leaders strove to stay polite while scrambling to limit the damage.

The salvage operation appears to have been relatively successful, following Sunday’s meeting in Geneva between the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and a Ukrainian delegation. The 28-point plan reportedly drafted by Mr Trump’s envoy, Steve Witkoff, and the Kremlin adviser, Kirill Dmitriev, was in effect a repackaging of Mr Putin’s maximalist demands. A deal premised on the handing over of new territory in the Donbas region to Russia, restrictions on Ukraine’s sovereignty, and drastic limits on the size of its future army, could never be acceptable to Kyiv. Mr Rubio, suggesting a more “refined” framework was now being developed, seemed to at least acknowledge this fundamental difficulty.

As the usual stream of self-regarding bluster and bombast emanates from the White House, it is impossible to know whether a negotiating endgame is truly at hand. But certain principles bear restating as a starting point for meaningful talks. Future European security, and the basic principles of international law, demand that Mr Putin’s brutal aggression is not simply rubber-stamped and rewarded, and that Ukraine’s sovereignty and independence is prioritised. To Kyiv’s persistent disadvantage, Mr Trump’s administration likes to position itself as a neutral broker between unequal warring parties. In response, European countries must insist on a proactive role in forthcoming peace negotiations, and try to exert some moral leverage.

Europe, after all, is now bearing the bulk of the cost of Ukraine’s continued resistance. It can use its influence and collective weight to furnish Mr Zelenskyy with the negotiating cards which Mr Trump has previously asserted that he lacks. If the EU can belatedly reach agreement on a €140bn “reparations loan” to Kyiv, underwritten by frozen Russian assets, Mr Putin’s apparent judgment that he can outlast Ukrainian resistance may begin to look questionable. A combination of arms and financial support, and greater economic pressure on Russia, are needed to alter calculations in the Kremlin and genuinely bring Mr Putin to the negotiating table.

This, rather than attempting to bully Mr Zelenskyy into a form of capitulation, is the path to achieving a just and sustainable peace. As Ukraine’s president wearily restated at the weekend: “The crux of the entire diplomatic situation is that it was Russia, and only Russia, that started this war, and it is Russia, and only Russia, that has been refusing to end it.”

There are already signs that the Kremlin is preparing to reject modifications to Mr Witkoff’s Putin-friendly plan. Yet whether through naivety, a crude notion of realpolitik or a greedy desire to open up Russian markets, Mr Trump and his aides seem repeatedly minded to lobby for peace on Moscow’s terms. Searching for a moral compass in the White House is a futile exercise. Europe’s leaders need to start trying to shape some facts on the ground.",2025-11-24 00:00:00,literal,Factual reporting on reporting and policy,literal,literal,0,literal,0.8083023,0.19169769,0.8083023,True

If you were asked to name the three lowest moments in the history of the Grammy Awards, you ... might have a tough time narrowing down a proper list. You might note the year the Grammys introduced a heavy metal category, rightfully nominated Metallica and then gave the award to Jethro Tull. Or the year Macklemore swept Kendrick Lamar in the hip-hop categories, prompting an outcry from pretty much everyone, including Macklemore himself. Or the year Tracy Chapman's ""Fast Car"" lost record of the year to Bobby McFerrin's ""Don't Worry, Be Happy,"" or … okay, let's move on. Grammy history is festooned with inexplicable snubs, embarrassments, blind spots and moments in which classics were passed over in favor of flashes in the pan.

Still, the Grammys have never absorbed a greater embarrassment than they experienced when news broke that the public-facing members of Milli Vanilli — winner of the Grammy for best new artist at the beginning of 1990 — didn't sing their own songs. Rob Pilatus and Fab Morvan, the photogenic performers who'd been the faces of Milli Vanilli, were actually lip-syncing the frothy pop songs that had made them famous. It was a significant scandal in the fall of 1990 — though, as is the case with so many scandals, the folks who experienced the most public shaming (Pilatus, Morvan, the Recording Academy) didn't exactly align with those most directly responsible (if you're looking for someone to blame, consider producer Frank Farian, or perhaps the rain). Milli Vanilli's Grammy was revoked and that was that.

The incident didn't just make the Grammys look bad, or throw kindling on the roaring rhetorical fire of those lamenting the fabricated nature of so much pop music. It also compelled them to be more cautious about honoring genres and subgenres widely viewed as lightweight. In the decades since, the Grammys have been slow to embrace boy bands, K-pop acts and other artists who face a credibility gap among Grammy voters, whose 21st century preferences have tended more toward legacy acts (Steely Dan, Herbie Hancock), flamboyant showmen (Jon Batiste, Bruno Mars), jazzy pop sophisticates (Norah Jones, Samara Joy) and contemporary rock stars (Beck, Foo Fighters).

When Harry Styles won album of the year in 2023 and said, ""This doesn't happen to people like me very often,"" he got roasted for it on social media. But people like Styles — not ""rich young good-looking white men"" so much as ""singers who came up in boy bands like One Direction"" — actually have often struggled to win Grammys, and are generally expected to pass through a sort of authenticity gauntlet (or at least demonstrate pop-cultural staying power) before getting accepted into the club. The Grammys have even tweaked their own eligibility requirements for the category of best new artist — it used to be far more stringent about newness than it is now — in part to allow acts more time to prove themselves.

Why does that unofficial authenticity gauntlet exist? At least one of the answers is that Milli Vanilli won best new artist in 1990. As much as the Grammys are known for making embarrassing mistakes — you know it's true — they're also known for overcorrecting in the years that follow. Metallica lost that metal Grammy for …And Justice for All in 1989, only to win an award for ""One"" (a song from the same record!) the following year, and then ""Stone Cold Crazy"" the year after that, and then the black album the year after that. Kendrick Lamar got shut out in that fateful Year of Macklemore (2014), only to win 22 Grammys and counting in the years since — including two in 2015 and five in 2016. After years of frustration in the general categories, Beyoncé's Cowboy Carter finally won album of the year in 2025, after decades of taking home awards primarily in genre-specific categories like R&B and pop.

The Grammys, for all their faults, do try to right their old wrongs. But the initial beneficiaries of their mistakes aren't always so lucky. Macklemore has never sniffed a Grammy nomination in the years since beating Lamar. In the case of Jethro Tull, that 1989 win corresponded with the veteran band's first — and, at least as of this writing, last — nomination.

Milli Vanilli's post-Grammy story has proven more complicated — and tragic. Pilatus and Morvan attempted a comeback as actual singers, released an ill-fated album as Rob & Fab in 1993 and even prepared a follow-up. But that record was shelved upon Pilatus' death in 1998. Morvan, however, has kept working — as a musician, a DJ and an author. Earlier this year, he released his memoir, You Know It's True: The Real Story of Milli Vanilli, which was accompanied by an audiobook read by Morvan himself.

On Nov. 7, 35 years after the Grammys forgot his number, Morvan was nominated in the category of best audio book, narration and storytelling recording. His competition includes Supreme Court Associate Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson and the Dalai Lama, who, had they thought ahead, really should have lip-synced each other's books, just to be rascals.

It's a twist few saw coming: a redemption story for a guy who helped bend the arc of Grammy history.

NBC News Think,https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-walking-shoes-from-amazon-rcna215913,The Best Walking Shoes For Women From Amazon,"Whether you’re power-walking through the neighborhood, on your feet from 9 to 5, or constantly chasing after small, fast-moving humans, a comfortable, slip-resistant shoe with real support isn’t a luxury — it’s a necessity.

Experts say that, if you can swing it, your best bet is to get properly fitted at a specialty running store — especially if you deal with foot pain or conditions like plantar fasciitis. But here’s the good news: many of the most recommended walking-shoe brands from those stores — think Brooks, ASICS, Saucony, Skechers, and New Balance — are also just a few clicks away on Amazon.

Below, I gathered a list of highly rated walking sneakers with expert advice in mind. Your feet (and your schedule) will thank you.

How I picked the best walking shoes for women from Amazon

In a previous guide on best women’s walking shoes, podiatrists Olga Shvets and Miguel Cunha said the first step to buying the right walking shoe is knowing what type of arch support you need — neutral, low or high. This depends on knowing whether your foot type is pronator (when your ankle or arch rolls or tips inward slightly), supinator (when your weight rolls onto the outer edges of your feet) or neutral (when your foot lands on your heel and rolls forward so that your impact is distributed evenly). If buying online, Shvets recommends looking at a well-worn pair of sneakers you already own to see where they are worn out.

Here are some of the other important factors our experts provided when we were coming up with our list of the best walking shoes on Amazon:

Arch support: Shoes with good arch support will be comfortable for longer. Look for a footbed made of memory foam or an ethyl vinyl acetate (EVA) anti-compression insole for maximum comfort.

Comfortable uppers: Look for flexible uppers that are made from durable materials, so they last.

Weight: A heavy shoe is going to fatigue you faster. Opt for a lightweight sneaker to keep you comfortable and fast on your feet.

Best women’s walking shoes on Amazon

To help you shop for a great-quality walking shoe on Amazon, I’ve rounded up 10 of the best options in line with our expert guidance, as well as some highly rated brands that are breathable, lightweight, provide excellent arch support and more. I’ve also included options in every price range, from the most budget-friendly to the most splurge-worthy.

These sneakers were tested for the NBC Select Wellness Awards and were a big hit amongst many staffers. “These are so well-cushioned that I can wear them all day,” says NBC Select associate SEO reporter Ashley Morris, who has flat feet. The sneakers have a wider toe box and soft cushioning for all-day wear.

These mesh slip-on shoes are breathable and lightweight and include a sock liner that adapts to your foot while you walk, according to the brand. The insole is made of Skechers’ Gogo Max technology, which provides added cushioning and support, according to Skechers. The Go Joy comes in medium, narrow and wide sizes and 37 color options, including hot pink, red, charcoal, black and taupe.

A favorite of Cunha, the Guide 15 has been redesigned with thicker cushioning and higher sidewalls for better stability. They also have a thick sole from heel to toe to absorb impact. “I always recommend this shoe because it delivers a softer heel strike and takes some stress off the foot,” he says.

Hoka’s Rincon 4 is lightweight yet highly cushioned. These sneakers have 3 millimeters of additional stacked height compared to previous versions. The shoes are intended for the gym or strength training sessions and offer neutral stability, according to the brand. They have a padded collar and tongue for comfort and the upper is made from a breathable double jacquard that is durable, according to the brand.

The v13 was designed for walkers and average runners who aren’t focused on speed, according to the brand. Shvets likes this shoe for the additional cushioning that helps absorb impact and protect the joints. These shoes can also accommodate orthotics comfortably and are great for the elderly population, says Shvets.

These sneakers have a leather upper and rubber soles to provide grip as you walk. They’re made with a memory foam sole for cushioning and the way they are constructed moves air from your heel to your forefoot and back to keep feet cool, according to the brand.

These popular shoes are lightweight and breathable and have extra padding in the sole and heel collar for added comfort. They’re also machine washable for easy cleaning.

These sneakers are a NBC Select Wellness Award winner and one of the best walking shoes. They slip on, though they look as though they have laces. The shoes have thick foam cushioning that is bouncy and supportive to provide comfort all day.

Another highly rated slip-on, the Doussprt is made of mesh fabric and has an elastic cuff for easy on and off. Its perforated arch is designed for extra ventilation and its air cushion technology provides a buffer between you and the ground to help protect you from injury, according to Doussprt. The footbed is made of mesh and EVA for added arch support. They also have a slip-resistant heel and a wide, round toe, which make these ideal for those who need to stand for long periods, according to the brand.

Like the Doussprt, this STQ walking shoe is made of breathable mesh fabric with a wide, round toe, so they are comfortable enough for all-day standing, according to the brand. Best for those requiring low arch support, these shoes have a thick sole with air cushioning to help absorb the impact as you walk. At just under 1 pound, the STQ is extremely lightweight. These mesh slip-ons are machine washable and come in 13 colors, including taupe, dark grey, navy and purple.

Al Jazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/11/13/trump-wants-to-recreate-the-british-mandate-in-palestine,Trump wants to recreate the British mandate in Palestine,"The US president is pushing a UN resolution that would revive the mandate structure of 100 years ago almost entirely, simply replacing the UK with the US as the authority in control.

The Trump administration is pushing an Israeli-crafted resolution at the UN Security Council (UNSC) this week aimed at eliminating the possibility of a State of Palestine. The resolution does three things. It establishes US political control over the Gaza Strip. It separates Gaza from the rest of Palestine. And it allows the US, and therefore Israel, to determine the timeline for Israel’s supposed withdrawal from Gaza, which would mean never.

This is imperialism masquerading as a peace process. In and of itself, it is no surprise. Israel runs US foreign policy in the Middle East. What is a surprise is that the US and Israel might just get away with this travesty unless the world speaks up with urgency and indignation.

The draft UNSC resolution would establish a US-UK-dominated Board of Peace, chaired by none other than President Donald Trump himself, and endowed with sweeping powers over Gaza’s governance, borders, reconstruction, and security. This resolution would sideline the State of Palestine and condition any transfer of authority to the Palestinians on the indulgence of the Board of Peace.

This would be an overt return to the British mandate of 100 years ago, with the only change being that the US would hold the mandate rather than the United Kingdom. If it were not so utterly tragic, it would be laughable. As Marx said, history repeats itself, first as tragedy, then as farce. Yes, the proposal is a farce, yet Israel’s genocide is not. It is a tragedy of the first order.

Incredibly, according to the draft resolution, the Board of Peace would be granted sovereign powers in Gaza. Palestinian sovereignty is left to the discretion of the board, which alone would decide when Palestinians are “ready” to govern themselves – perhaps in another 100 years? Even military security is subordinated to the board, and the envisioned forces would answer not to the UNSC or to the Palestinian people, but to the board’s “strategic guidance”.

The US-Israel resolution is being put forward precisely because the rest of the world – other than Israel and the US – has woken up to two facts. First, Israel is committing genocide, a reality witnessed every day in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, where innocent Palestinians are murdered to the satisfaction of the Israeli military and illegal Israeli settlers in the West Bank. Second, Palestine is a state, albeit one whose sovereignty remains obstructed by the US, which uses its veto in the UNSC to block Palestine’s permanent UN membership. At the UN this past July and then again in September, the UN General Assembly voted overwhelmingly for Palestine’s statehood, a fact that put the Israel-US Zionist lobby into overdrive, resulting in the current draft resolution.

For Israel to accomplish its goal of Greater Israel, the US is pursuing a classic divide-and-conquer strategy, squeezing Arab and Islamic states with threats and inducements. When other countries resist the US-Israel demands, they are cut off from critical technologies, lose access to World Bank and IMF financing, and suffer Israeli bombing, even in countries with US military bases present. The US offers no real protection; rather, it orchestrates a protection racket, extracting concessions from countries wherever US leverage exists. This extortion will continue until the global community stands up to such tactics and insists upon genuine Palestinian sovereignty and US and Israeli adherence to international law.

Palestine remains the endless victim of US and Israeli manoeuvres. The results are not just devastating for Palestine, which has suffered an outright genocide, but for the Arab world and beyond. Israel and the US are currently at war, overtly or covertly, across the Horn of Africa (Libya, Sudan, Somalia), the eastern Mediterranean (Lebanon, Syria), the Gulf region (Yemen), and Western Asia (Iraq, Iran).

If the UNSC is to provide true security according to the UN Charter, it must not yield to US pressures and instead act decisively in line with international law. A resolution truly for peace should include four vital points. First, it should welcome the State of Palestine as a sovereign UN member state, with the US lifting its veto. Second, it should safeguard the territorial integrity of the State of Palestine and Israel, according to the 1967 borders. Third, it should establish a UNSC-mandated protection force drawn up from Muslim-majority states. Fourth, it should include the defunding and disarmament of all belligerent non-state entities, and it should ensure the mutual security of Israel and Palestine.

The two-state solution is about true peace, not about the politicide and genocide of Palestine, or the continued attacks by militants on Israel. It is time for both Palestinians and Israelis to be safe, and for the US and Israel to give up the cruel delusion of permanently ruling over the Palestinian people.

If you or someone you know is in crisis, call or text 988 to reach the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline.

Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) often finds himself at odds with his party.

He's unapologetically pro-Israel. He spent the fall railing against the federal government shutdown and he, along with a few other Senate Democrats, broke from the party and struck a deal with Republicans.

""It's always been wrong for us to shut the government down,"" he told NPR. ""Rightly, [Democrats] criticize the Republicans when they've shut the government down. It's wrong. It's reckless.""

In an interview with All Things Considered host Scott Detrow, Fetterman posed a question to his critics: ""What exactly am I guilty of?""

""I suffered from depression and I made a recovery and I won an election,"" he said. ""And I went on to be an unapologetic supporter of Israel. And I happen to think that we have to have a secure border and I think it's wrong to shut our government down.""

Fetterman spoke with NPR in a conversation tied to his new memoir, Unfettered, about his 2022 Senate campaign that saw him suffer a stroke and fall into a deep depression.

The interview text below has been edited for length and clarity.

Interview highlights

Scott Detrow: This is a book about an election cycle where you suffered a stroke and you struggled with serious depression.

Sen. John Fetterman: Profound depression. Honestly, I know millions of Americans suffer from it.

And when you hear the expression that you can't get out of your bed — that's true.

Detrow: Last time I interviewed you, you had just returned to the Senate from Walter Reed [National Military Medical Center]. It was a pretty emotional conversation. You were still processing your treatment and what came next.

I wanted to ask a little bit about that because there's parts of this book where it seems like you're saying that you've, at times, regretted being so open about your mental health struggles. Is that accurate?

Fetterman: No. I don't regret it.

But people have been willing to use it or to create an impression that's just not true. And it's an honest conversation because a lot of people have had those things. And I've had a lot of people reach out to me over the years since and it's an honor to speak to people, to their experience, because sometimes people can feel alone.

And I've always wanted to make that conversation as simple as it can to just stay in this game. Because I've had people in my life make the decision to leave. And that's not a fail, they didn't fail. But that's a decision that they can't come back [from]. And how heartbreaking that is and how sad that is.

Detrow: You're talking about suicide.

Fetterman: Yeah, absolutely.

It's not a weakness. And that's [I want to be] a voice saying, ""hey, look, that's a lie. I don't know what your recovery looks like, but as long as you stay in it, I promise you you will get better.""

Detrow: I want to ask about Israel. You were very out front about [supporting Israel]. You never changed your tune. I'm wondering, as the Israeli attacks and bombing of Gaza continued, were there any points where you second guessed the place that you had staked yourself?

Fetterman: [Israel] had an opportunity to take out the Iranian nuclear facilities. I was the only Democrat that supported that. I was actually charging for those things. You know, that comes from Trump. Well, then I happen to agree with it. And now, can you imagine if they would have acquired a nuclear weapon there? And now what is behind this constant violence there? Is it Israel or it's because Iran funding these proxies like Hamas and Hezbollah doing these kinds of terrible things. And that war would have ended when you sent back all the hostages.

Detrow: So, at no point in the conflict did the balance shift for you as you thought about this in the context of 69,000 Palestinians dead?

Fetterman: No one breaks down how many actual Hamas fighters or other people that were involved in that. So, we're not really sure.

The only time you see members in Hamas is when they're handing over funerals and rallying. Otherwise, they embed themselves in the civilians and they were forced to fight a war through an urban situation.

Why can't people condemn putting tunnels under hospitals and embedding themselves in where civilians are? And you know, because they can't fight a real war. So, that's why they use civilians as human shields. And that's the tragedy.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/sep/17/this-much-i-know-grace-jones-how-these-young-girls-twerk-i-dont-know,"Grace Jones: ‘Even if I stand on my head, I still can’t do it. How these young girls twerk, I don’t know’","I was raised in Spanish Town, Jamaica, by my grandmother and step-grandfather. My grandmother’s brother was a Pentecostal bishop, so we were made examples of at the Jamaican Pentecostal church, where the Bible is interpreted very literally. I wasn’t allowed to wear trousers or straighten my hair, so combing my hair was very painful, and I would be punished if any of my actions were considered idle.

At 18 I travelled to Paris, Italy and New York – and took a lot of acid. I found it mind-opening. There were always doctors around, so it never really felt dangerous, even when I took an STP, a super trip pill, and couldn’t come down for at least three days.

I decided to pursue acting after performing at my first summer stock musical at Saint Joseph’s college in Philadelphia. The modelling was just a way to pay my rent. I didn’t want to go home to Jamaica. I thought: “If I’m going to act, I might as well try everything.” I took as many jobs as I could – for one week, two weeks, a month – just to learn the process.

The first magazine to hire me was GQ in New York, but they wanted me to wear a wig. I remember flicking through it and thinking: “I don’t even recognise myself. This isn’t going to work.”

I never wanted to move to Hollywood – I never did – so when I first went there to film Vamp, I surrounded myself with friends: Keith Haring [who body-painted Jones], Andy Warhol, Antonio Lopez. I lived like a vampire: up all night, asleep all day.

Roger Moore made me laugh on A View to a Kill. I’d heard he had a reputation that lightened the mood: he’d hide sex toys around the bed and goose you with them. I beat him to it. I went down to the prop room and found a huge black-and-white polka-dot dildo, strapped it on under my robe, and surprised him instead.

My biggest regret is not doing Blade Runner. Jean-Paul Goude – my son’s dad – and Ridley Scott were very competitive as artists. Ridley wanted me to play a snake lady, but Jean-Paul was very French and didn’t like to share.

My son, Paulo Goude, is my greatest achievement. He’s a songwriter, producer and incredible musician – and my beautiful granddaughter, too.

The last time I cried was during Covid. I got detained at an airport. I’m not going to say which country. I like to leave a little mystery.

When I worked as a go-go dancer, I called myself Grace Mendoza. I learned how to tweak one side of my ass, then tweak the other and make it jump. Now I can’t do the dances they do in Jamaica. I try so hard to make my whole butt bounce up and down, but even if I stand on my head, I still can’t do it. How these young girls twerk, I don’t know.

How would I like to be remembered? Remember me as the whole tequila, worm and everything.

I’m not scary if you haven’t done something to make me scary. I’ve realised that when some people lash out, it’s not really me they’re lashing out at. They usually have a problem with themselves. So I stopped hitting people. Let’s just say that I don’t beat anybody up any more.
