Most TV shows aren't good we just need to see how it ends I started rewatching Stranger Things the other day since the new season is coming out in a few weeks... At the time I thought it was incredibly unique fun scary and incredibly emotional. Really one of the few times a TV show ever actually made me tear up... I think most TV shows are plot forward so they get a tremendous amount of hype surrounding them for a little while but once the show concludes they're pretty quickly forgotten.,literal

By Martha McHardy — US News Reporter | A clear majority of voters would choose a Democrat candidate for Congress if the midterms were held today a new poll shows. The PBS News/NPR/Marist survey conducted between November 10 and 13 revealed that 55 percent of voters would elect a Democratic candidate compared to 41 percent who would opt for a Republican. The 14-point lead for the Democrats is the party's largest since November 2017. In 2018 during Trump's first term the Democrats won more than 40 seats in the House of Representatives in the midterm elections.,literal

I've seen more poor people trying to look wealthy by wearing designer or expensive brands with big logos than I've seen anyone with money wearing them. At this point big designer logo stuff just registers in my brain as trashy or ghetto. Big logos for things people like like a show or a something similiar I see as neat. Its not trying to be fancy and makes me wanna go up and ask what they like about whatever the logo is from.,figurative
You shouldn't be shamed for not supporting local businesses I'm going to buy things for the cheapest possible price because I don't have much money. I'm not going to feel bad about not buying from the local independently run shop for a higher price. I didn't ask them to start a business and they don't support me in any way so what do I owe them? Being able to buy locally is often a very privileged position. People who say it's only a few bucks more don't realise how significant a few bucks - added on to every purchase - is to a lot of people.,literal

Most pieces of a salad are scooped onto a fork anyway so why not maximize scoopage with a spoon??,literal
If you damage another vehicle while driving a company/government vehicle you should lose access to your personal vehicle until the damaged private car is driveable again The consequences of causing a wreck with a company vehicle are far less than when you crash your personal vehicle.

I think he might bi or say too. No way would Fred not have tried to beat out anything that even seemed remotely not heterosexual out of Donny (there's a story that he beat the shit out of Donald for wanting to wear a baseball team's hat to one of their games Fred was taking him to for being queer). Given his weird machismo and oddly homosexual actions as well as the penchant for powerful rich guys to delude themselves into thinking that having sex with other men is somehow more straight than banging a chick I'm 100% certain he's the way he is because he was raised to be a violent sexually repressed psychopath. Truly makes you wonder how far back the bad goes. Fred's dad was a nazi POS too but was he a violent thug who beat and raped his own children? I dunno but it seems likely that Fred learned it from somewhere.,literal

Apple pie is only good with whipped cream or a la mode Apple pie and other similar chunked and cooked fruit based deserts have a horrible horrible texture. The texture of cooked fruit is slimey and the fruit is usually inconsistently cooked resulting in an unpredictable mouthfeel.

The only way to combat this is with whipped cream or ice cream whose delectable creaminess help round out the slimey insides of a pie...,figurative

The CSCE Final Act doesn't contain anything more binding. Its an agreement from the 80s that was essentially just a statement by everyone involved that they recognize and will respect each other's borders it was a way to try to tone down some of the rhetoric of the cold war. There's nothing in there about collective action or guaranteeing the borders of all signatories. The inclusion by reference in the Budapest Memorandum looks to be more a statement along the lines of since Ukraine didnt exist as an independent country then we will agree to recognize and respect Ukraine's borders in line with the principles established in this previous agreement. The actual enforcement for violations is still just that they have to be brought to the UNSC. I have no disagreement with anyone who says that the US using economic leverage or trying to get Ukraine to give up territory could be interpreted as the US going against the Budapest Memorandum though personally I think its safe to say it became defunct once the Russian invasion was brought to the UNSC. The only point I'm trying to make is that it's simply incorrect to say that the Budapest Memorandum contained security guarantees.,figurative

The problem is that everyone--EVERYONE--said the same thing during the housing bubble recovery. What ended up happening is both the Democrats and Republicans made a big show of grandstanding and yelling at Big Bank and then they punished these banks by taking on billions of dollars of worthless MBSs that they still haven't offloaded. 30% of the entire market of MBS are owned by the US Government as a result of bailouts. As a reminder prior to 2008 the US Government owned roughly 0% of all mortgage backed securities. So basically ever since the bailout--where these banks should have failed and been replaced by banks that manage money better--the US Government rewarded all these banks with a means to take exceptional risk while having a guaranteed safety net.,figurative
