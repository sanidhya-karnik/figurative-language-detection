Cinematic trailers are better than gameplay trailers. They're just better. Now at least. Gameplay trailers are only useful if you intend to pre-order a game now... Reviews and raw gameplay footage that is not curated by the developer are a more reliable metric of quality. Gameplay trailers definitely USED to be more helpful but now are kinda just worse excitement generators than a good cinematic trailer.,figurative
OK lets go in order of what you said: Who else would you believe but the IDF? You going to trust a terrorist Show me proof that the retaliation was bombarding and killing hundreds of civilians (you wont show me this) Show me proof of the continuing airstrikes that werent a retaliation to a terrorist attack. Show me these outside observers and these documents of 1000+ violations. It is understandable because you are writing lies,literal

Thanksgiving isn't as prevalent anymore because major companies can't make money off of it and its important that we don't let it happen... companies used to at least acknowledge the time but now since they don't I believe its because they've grown to much onto us and because we are all so dependent on their goods they are starting to overstep because we are allowing them to walk all over our culture as a society...,figurative

It's not terrible but not great and nowhere close to as memorable/iconic as LOTR. The first movie I thoroughly enjoyed. The second had a strong start but fell kind of flat for me.

I think The Hobbit would have 100% worked better as a two-part series with each part being around 3 hours.,figurative

No one locally is selling dry shampoo or sneakers (the two things I wanted to buy this week),literal
Refried beans is kinda gross actually. Not only does it look unappetizing it's also got a slimy texture. It tastes a bit weird too at best like mashed beans.

Overcooked rice is good I don't mean WAYYY over cooked but rice that's slightly mushy and sticks together just a bit too much is the best way to make rice... Now when I make rice for myself I watch it and let it over cook just a little. It's just BETTER I like how easy it is to pick up with a fork I like that the texture isn't as grainy and I feel like the seasonings that I added to the rice while cooking have absorbed more. So yes I think overcooked rice is better.,literal

Shrek 3 isn't the worst Shrek movie I'm not saying it's the best one but it's far better than most people give it credit for. It felt like a satisfying way to close the Shrek story. Shrek and Fiona settle down to have kids in peace at the swamp Charming dies a satisfying death and Far Far Away has a new young ruler who wants and is capable of the job. Not to mention it's truly hilarious at times Merlin was an awesome new character and a lot of the jokes land well. Shrek 4 is by far the worst one IMO. Felt like a total cash grab and added absolutely nothing to the Shrek story in general. It really just wasn't funny either,figurative
I'm seeing Israel accusing Hamas of firing at IDF (without any evidence of such and Hamas denying it) and responding by bombarding Gazan civilians and killing hundreds.

Idk how any of that is understandable.,literal

Most Popular Horror Movie Villains Are Not Scary IMO unstoppable entities that just keep coming back through movie tropes are not scary in the slightest. Freddy Jason Michael Myers etc lose their scare factor when in every movie no matter what the protagonist does they come back. It erases the stakes tension buildup and grip of the plot.

Look at the first world war. Look at world war 2. Look at any major war in history. You will notice the disproportionate amount of deaths one or several sides have. The UN was created because if a third big one kicks off there will once again be millions of deaths disproportionate affecting one or several sides. Also ceasefires have never had a requirement to be proportional either. Its why india and Pakistan can heat up and go back to the status quo occasionally. Once again war being destructive and the losses inflicting being disproportionately is why war should be avoided,figurative

A lot of modern anime feels like a social skills guide disguised as a story. So I used to watch a fair share of anime when I was younger but I've fallen off in recent years.

Also when he was running he actually asked people to stop donating because he had reached the donation cap. Which just feels very honest.
