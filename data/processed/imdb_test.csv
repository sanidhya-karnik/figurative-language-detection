"I made this account to give this movie a 1/10 This movie did not make any sense to me! It's far too violent to tell such a shallow and ultimately senseless story. I had high expectations, seeing the great actors involved and the 7.1 rating. Initially, the movie was quite interesting, as it reflects on the dystopian times of COVID, fake news, social media turning into a source of polarization, and so on. But then, somehow, it completely derails and the violence takes over. It's as if the filmmakers ran out of inspiration and used extreme violence to fill the void. Provocation for the sake of provocation.

I'm genuinely astonished that this was made into an actual movie, that the actors were willing to participate, and that someone was willing to finance this mess. If I want to see violence, I can just watch the news. The money could have been spent so much better, especially in this world of turmoil. What a waste of precious life and energy to make this film, let alone watch it.",literal
"This film is annoying From the extremely irritating characters, really bad acting that feels like stage improv, the predictable storyline, which I said to my wife ""it is going to end with this happening and that happening"". And sure enough, that's exactly how it happened.

Even though this same story has been made many times in more successful Christmas films, this one took the same idea and concept and spent 2 hours sitting down to write a really bad script. All the characters are very unlikeable, especially the massively over the top Harry Potter fanatic, Nigel. It's just a very bad attempt at a Christmas rom com. And so, I give it a one.",literal
"If you mixed the prime of Covid with the Black Lives Matter protests and put them in a small town and dialled it up to 100 this is the film that you would get. This was definitely a more normal film by Ari Aster's standards, though still crazy. There was a point in the film where things switched up very fast, and you could see it coming.

Joaquin Phoenix was just exceptional, it's another terrific performance added to his filmography. Pedro Pascal, Emma Stone, Austin Butler, Deidre O'Connell, Michael Ward, Luke Grimes, and William Belleau were all phenomenal as well.

The cinematography was magnificent. I especially loved the shot in the beginning of the film where the red side of the police light was slowly flashing on Joaquin Phoenix's face.

Ari Aster really knows how to tell a story, make you feel imbedded into that story, and keep you engrossed for the entire runtime (and in this case it was a 2hr 30min runtime). I loved Midsommar as well so I'll definitely be watching the rest of his filmography.

Overall, this was a terrific film and a massively enjoyable watch.

"So dumb it's good I like all the stupid plus the 90s actors. All the cringe and discomfort your looking for in a Christmas film. Adorably embraces all of the Christmas movie clichés. If you are looking for deep and profound, turn around and walk away briskly. If you want some cheesiness with a twist, enjoy the goofiness.",literal
"For a story built on precision and gravity, Nuremberg feels like a glossy reenactment that forgot to bring both. *Nuremberg* should've been a slam dunk-an era soaked in moral complexity, political tension, and enough real-world drama to power ten films. Instead, it settles for being a handsomely shot history lesson that keeps tripping over its own choices. Yes, it shed light on some behind-the-scenes trial dynamics I didn't know, and the cinematography and color work are legitimately strong. But the casting derails things fast: Rami Malek, a talented actor with exactly one gear, feels wildly misaligned with his role, turning crucial scenes into accidental parody every time that trademark smirk surfaces.. The pacing barrels forward like it's trying to catch a connecting flight, suffocating moments that desperately needed room to breathe. And in the rush, accuracy gets tossed overboard, American heroism dialed up, international nuance dialed down, timelines shuffled like a deck of discount playing cards. I should have called it 2 mins in with how bad they butchered the accuracy of Goring's actual surrender to US troops.

A disappointment at **5.2/10**, made all the more frustrating because the raw material deserved better.",figurative
"If you want absolute truth, read a book or watch a documentary Premium cable network historical dramas - even those that take creative license with dates and facts, like this one - are far better than most network and basic cable series. And don't get me started on reality series: housewives, teen moms, 90 day fiancé, bachelor and bachelorette, etc.

I've forgotten a lot of world history that was taught in high school, so these historical drama series remind me of the entire long history of humans. And when I don't understand something I've just watched, I look it up online (from a reputable source).

And watching this is WAY better than watching the news.",literal
"Sinners has some issues Sinners has some issues. This movie is trying so hard to be From Dusk Till Dawn, but it just comes up short in comparison. The first act involves Michael B. Jordan playing a set of twins as they set up for a party, it's slow and not very interesting. I get technology is getting better, but I don't like one actor playing two sides of a conversation. It's not the Nutty Professor, it never feels fluid, and it's probably why the two main characters spend most of the movie apart. Sinners struggles to get going but once the party starts you think you're in store for some cool vampire fight scenes, but you are mistaken. Instead, vampires dance an Irish Jig that caused the person I was watching the movie with to lean over and say to me ""this is the dumbest thing I've ever seen."" what it didn't have was some cool vampire fights. The action scenes are weak and for a movie that's also weak on character development and plot, you can't afford to also be lackluster with the action. This movie would probably be more fun if you went in blind and didn't know about the genre switch coming your way, but it ruins that with too much foreshadowing early on. Overall, I don't get what all the hype is about 6/10.",literal
"Huge fan of Toni Collette but.... I could only get through 1.3 episodes. I couldn't take the casting, writing or performance except for Brandon McLaren and Sydney Topliffe. Mae Martin is not a skilled actor. Aside from looking 20 years younger than their series wife they should have considered others to carry the lead. Bad choice. And really you should have budgeted for actor roles for all of the police because the background you hired do nothing for the show.",literal
I was in for more This was underwhelming. Artistically overdone to an almost comical degree. The constant screaming felt displaced. Even Christoph Waltz could not save this rubbish. I was looking for horror and mystery ... but got something like Dark Disney. Shelly would be appalled by this rendition of her work. A waste of time.,literal
"Cast not working Always admired how new cast members work well, however, to me Torres and Quinn don't work well with the team. Reeves works well. Torres and Quinn result in too many team members. Much prefer the dynamics between McGee, Bishop and Reeves with the rest of the team. Story lines have been weaker trying to work in Torres and Quinn. Plot lines with Reeves have been good.",literal
"Wonderful, intriguing story! The actors are wonderful and authentic, the script terrific. Makes you want to know everyone in it! Great depiction of the Navajo nation-very nuanced life stories and the struggles of life on the reservation. Beautiful photography, too! Fascinating to see how these mysteries were solved with 1970s technology-no cell phones, no GPS. Missed watching it when season 2 ended-wanted to know what each person was doing after the episodes concluded. Hope the producers have the wisdom to keep this going. I haven't read the Hilleman books, but presume that there are many more rich stories to tell. Can't wait for Season 3!",literal
"Tough to watch Monster is a series created by Ryan Murphy (American Crime Story, American Horror Story, 9-1-1, Hollywood, Pose, Feud, etc.). Everything Murphy touches is pretty much successful and this is no different. Everyone knows this story by now...he's one of the most notorious serial killers in the history of the United States. He would lure young men to his apartment and not only kill them but eat them. This is a story that's been told many times but this show takes the unique perspective of largely telling the story from the victims point of view. Evan Peters is absolutely brilliant as Jeffrey Dahmer. He's so good that he should be talked about for an Emmy nomination next year. This series is worth watching for Peters performance alone. This is very dark, disturbing story and Ryan Murphy does a great job telling it.",literal
"Better Call Saul! What an adventure that was, better call Saul in my eyes is the best spin off I've seen made. Featuring not only original Breaking Bad characters it introduces some really colorful people bringing the epic to an even more intense feeling like its predecessor.

I loved Better Call Saul, its really interesting diving into the life of Jimmy Mcgill or as we know him Saul Goodman or even Slippin' Jimmy. I enjoyed learning more about Mike and gus it was really interesting seeing how everything started off, honestly such an experience.

Highly recommend Its a great show with just as many twists and turns as breaking bad, hold onto your seats.",figurative
"Best New Show I've Seen in a Long Long Time I have never watched Castle, only knew of Nathan Fillion by reputation and from seeing him on Modern Family. He is extremely engaging.

Putting all that aside, this was an outstanding first episode of what appears to have the possibility of being a great show. Enjoyed the fact that it was really about all the rookies, not just the ""40-year old rookie."" The stories of all the characters were interesting and the revelation about one of the TO's was particularly stunning.

Looking forward to a season of great stories with lots of character development and interesting plots.",figurative
"Silly, Fluffy Fun! In the poop show that was 2021, the television gods were kind enough to grant us one hilarious, albeit vapid, bright spot. Everything about this show is ridiculous in the best way. Each ghost is brilliantly cast, and some of the humor is so dry you just might miss it if you're not paying attention. Overall, this is a huge thumbs up for me.",literal
"Hasn't aged well. I first saw this a long time ago, and liked it a lot. On a recent viewing, I find that it hasn't aged as well as I thought. It was fun to see John Galecki and Juliette Lewis as children, and I had forgotten how pretty Julia Louis-Dreyfus was back then. I got one big laugh-out-loud moment from the whole movie, when the old aunt forgets that she is supposed to say the pre-meal blessing, and starts into the Pledge of Allegiance instead, and the whole family dutifully joins in. Clark Griswold is such a sad sack, and even though I know it is the point of the film, it's still a bit cloying. This is still OK as ""one of the Vacation films"" but if it stood alone, I think it would suffer.",literal
"You've got to love Nurse Jackie... I'm rewatching this series after 15yrs. I was bored and sick and had nothing to do. Didn't expect to love it.

I liked it a lot the first time. But now I see it with older eyes. More life experience. My own couple years of addiction with prescription meds. Dr prescribed, but miserable to come off none the less... This is beautiful show. Only now that I'm 45, close to Jackie's age do I really appreciate this. They don't make anything this anymore. Not with the heart and acting talent... plus dark humor. So much to enjoy.",literal
Great show that gets worse as it goes on.. Great characters in the beginning and the longer you go on the more insufferable and awful the characters and actors get. I wouldn't go behind season 7 with the exception of the Denzel Washington directed in season 12 ep 9. One of the best eps ever!!!,figurative
"Enjoyed it! Loved it! What I was expected was a comedy full of clichés about somebody going undercover,his crazy antics & so forth.

Instead we get a series about a man that not only helped others,but actually helped himself heal from losing his wife.

This great series wasn't full of cheesy laughs & corny lines,found myself actually emotional during some parts because of the way topics were handled-Like the resident with memory issues.

However it wasn't all serious that made you feel down or bored getting through episodes,it kept the series watch worthy because you wanted to see how it played out-Who did the stealing,etc.

The casting to acting was great,cinematography & locations nicely done.

I really hope they do another season & bring a great mixture of laughs,emotions,script,location plus cast like they did on Charles next detective styled adventures as they did on this one.",literal
Palomera The movie is good for if you don't have anything to do at the afternoon,literal
"White People Problems The entire series is just lie after lie from internal family drama, the kidnapping is just an excuse to expose these ""problems"".

It seems the writer ran out of ideas and decided to focus on white people problems instead. The entire thing feels artificial and made up.

It is unnecessary twists to fill up the main plot, which makes it empty and tiring to watch.",literal
"WEIRD SCIENCE (1985) Weird science is a raunchy comedy for younger teens but still gets away with more than a lot of other raunchy comedies. It is a classic film in the Jhon Hughes line up of movies. Its about two teens Gary and Wyatt that want to get laid, and with the power of a computer and some oingo boingo music the make a woman. And she is played by the beautiful Kelly LeBrock and this film awesome so go check it out.",literal
"Already looking forward to next season There are a million doctor/hospital shows out there so you really need to be special to stick out and The Pitt absolutely does that. It's not hyperbole when I say it's by far the most realistic hospital show that's ever been made. I'll be shocked if this show doesn't get nominated for a bunch of awards, especially Noah Wyle in the lead role. I've always like Wyle but this is career defining performance. He's fantastic in every scene. I'm a binged, I love to binge watch shows, so much so that even for the shows that come out weekly I wait until the entire season is over before I start it so I can binge it. This is the first show I've ever seen that I can only watch a few episodes at a time because of how intense each mood each episode is. I'll still watch a few episodes each day and binge the entire season within 5 or 6 days but it's a work out doing it. I'm so glad that people have enjoyed it so much that it's already been renewed for another season.",literal
"No Brainer No brainer...as in if you don't have one you will probably enjoy this movie.

A film with all the narrative depth of a video game and a lead character of cartoon proportions. It looks like one of those music videos where the visuals triumph over the song.

Plot holes? Don't get me started! The premise is ridiculous and it just goes downhill from there.

I didn't cheer for the big guy. I didn't care about any of the characters. I didn't care what happened next. I didn't care.

A thrill a minute if you're 12 years old and/or emotionally retarded. Otherwise it's an insult to the intelligence and an utterly vacuous bore.",literal
"Not faithful to the source material... Lets start with this: this is a good movie. But like the cult classic The Running Man, this movie does not follow the book it's based on. Sure, it's closer to the book than The Running Man was, but many things in the movie were different from the book. The differences that were made for expediency, like 3 mph (movie) vs. 4 mph (book) and 50 participants (movie) vs. 100 participants (book), are understandable for expediency and easier to film. The changes like character motivations for participating in the long walk were created in the movie. The ending in the movie was nowhere near what it was in the book. The actors were older than the boys on the long walk. Cooper Hoffman is 22 years old. David Johnson is 32.

The sound, cinematography, acting, and general quality of the movie is great; but the movie should have stuck to the source material.",literal
"A movie that thinks audiences are stupid Yes, thank you for showing those flashbacks a million times; how could audiences possibly remember what happened in a movie they're watching. Yes, thank you for adding extremely on-the-nose sound effects to a character's retelling of a lynching. Thank you for adding multiple unnecessary romance subplots that had no payoff, no purpose in the story. And of course, let's not forget creating characters that walk, talk and breathe like cliches of cliches, but still expecting your audiences to feel something for them. I swear, the writing for this movie is the epitome of trying to make every line of dialogue ooze ""coolness"" and be cinematic, to such a degree that it wraps around the other end and lands squarely in the ""cringe"" category. I did not like a single character, because none of them were people, just bundles of tropes I've already seen. The music wasn't even that good; I left the cinema without a single note of the soundtrack stuck in my head. Overall, wow, what a glorified baby mobile of a movie; perfect for those among us who never been to a cinema, or seen a single film in their life. The only reason I'm not giving it a lower rating is because it's clear the makers of it cared about what they were doing, even if it turned into a very subpar experience. Also the general idea for the plot was cool. What a shame it all went to waste.",figurative
"Far Better Than Most These Days Let's face it-the last two or three years have been absolutely brutal in terms of quality movies being made-let's hope the entire industry/art form is not in a permanent decline. Having said that. This Neeson flick is far superior to most of the garbage Hollywood is making lately. An exciting, sad, heartwarming story of decent people trying to do their best.",literal
"Dark, intricate amazing mystery with so many twists and turns you have to work to keep up! This series opens with an adrenaline rush and after finishing the second season, it never slowed down! I liked Stana Katic in Castle but she is freaking amazing in this show! I can't wait to find out what happens next!

Spoilers below.....

So in the 2 seasons we have amazing big studio action with FBI agents, Orphans used as test subjects, serial killers, good and bad agents... SO MANY freaking plot twists I had to go back and rewatch parts. I saw NO HOLES in the plot, you need to rewatch because you're just missing stuff. I totally disagree with the bad reviews here, this story is tight, it just has a ton of twists that keep you on your toes! Now I am rewatching with my husband because it is that good!

The killing with airborne poison is really crazy and just when you think you've figured all of it out more twists happen!

This is an awesome thrilling series and if Amazon is smart they'll keep this going!",figurative
"A Unique Concept, Which Is The Only Thing Uniqe About This Film I watched the movie on premiere day without having seen the trailers and only being semi-familiar with the franchise. And yet, even without having any expectations going into this film, it failed to captivate me in any meaningful way, resulting in just a generic popcorn flick.

The story revolves around Dek, an inexperienced Predator trying to prove his worth by hunting down a dangerous creature on a planet full of living death traps. However, his quest for blood takes a turn when he meets a synthetic android named Thia. As he starts forming a connection with her, Dek begins to realize there might be more to him than just being a deadly hunter.

The idea to have the main character be a lesser version of the Predator we all know and love is genius. Not only because having an alien protagonist is a rare thing to see in movies, but it would also allow the writers to explore more of the creature's mythos and give the audience a chance to see this popular figure slowly evolve into the brutal and intelligent brute he is. While we do get some lore of how the species operates, a well-paced evolution of Dek's set of skills is almost entirely absent from the movie, as he doesn't really LEARN to be better at combat or survival. Instead, he just randomly acquires the skillset to be more powerful.

The movie overall feels like a mix of elements taken from other films, which were way more succesful in their execution. For example the alien world is reminiscent of the enviroment from Avatar. Altough the landscapes are visually stunning and the alien wildlife can be very creative. It also seems to me like the movie is trying to use the Guardians of the Galaxy formula of 'misfits learning about caring for each other', but doesn't really provide a fresh take on it. It tries to imitate the Disney style of forced humor and having to have a talkative, quirky character, in the form of Thia, and a cute side character to be the protagonist's 'pet'. All of which we have already seen plenty of. The villain is also incredibly paper thin and cliché, like so many other plot points in this film.

All of these factors together form a movie experience that feels all too familiar and predictable to have any impact on you, despite the cool and interesting visuals. It's not something that you will completely regret spending your time watching, but you won't be able to recall what happened in this movie just a few hours after leaving the theaters...",literal
"Meh There are a lot of scenes where the main couple are making out etc, but for the whole series they seem to have little to any chemistry. It feels forced and contrived. Idk, my thoughts anyways. Also, if that many children/people were missing, it would definitely have garnered attention from several areas. It offered an interesting premise but offered a story that was underdeveloped and underwhelming. Sad to see Toni Colette involved in something that just seems to want her name on the roster.",literal
Great show minus a single character This show is exactly what you expect but in a good way. Hartley is a great actor for the main character and the supporting cast all play their parts well. Ackles steals the show in the episodes he is in being the best character. This all being said Billie is a truly awful actress and the show would benefit from either getting rid of the character or recasting. The constant traveling gives the show a different enough feel every week. The dialogue is well written and most characters are sharp and witty. The banter between them also makes the show better. They really make it feel like they are friends/frenemies (Again minus the wooden far too stoic acting thats given to Billie).,figurative
"Award for the worst movie of the last 30 years The worst movie I've ever seen in the last 30 years.

Boring, Pointless, not any scary scenes at all No plot until at all until 70 minutes, Bad cast and even worse charcthers.

Avoid at any cost, Save your time.

I have only one single question for the director of the movie, After filming and editing the entire movie didn't you watch it before you released it to the cinema?",literal
"Good could be great with different music The show is excellent - from the writing to the acting to the historically accurate sets and costumes BUT....the modern music choices are strange and out of place. Just when the viewer is fully immersed in 1800s wealthy brewery class culture they're catapulted right out of the story by a loud modern song. It's jarring and not in an artistic way. If this changes for season two, the show will exponentially improve. Ps. James Norton is a masterpiece.",figurative
"Great for the First 4 Seasons This was one of my favorite shows of all time but it felt forced starting at season 5. We lost characters that brought so much to the show and gained characters that cheapened it. Cliche after cliche, unrealistic storylines and unnecessary nudity from a character we're supposed to respect. It became apparent that the writers were grasping at straws to keep people interested, but the show was perfect as it was.",literal
"Bad ending killes a series Remember how the last season of GoT screwed up the enterie series? Well same goes for Supernatural sad to say, I actually looked forward to new seasons. The first was well bad, watched that one time and skipped over it after that.

I liked the episodes where Dean for gost sickness, actually laughed out loud, same goes for the rabbits foot. There was some that was just funny.

But to jump to the end, the last season was just a waiting, for the end. A drag. They made that entire season for the weiver to wait for the inevitable.

Cass - that was a sucky way to kill off that character. Oh yay iam happy so pls Mr nothing come get me.

Dean - after all the super fighting and ridiculous injuries he sustains during the series he gets offed by a rod in the back, pushed backwards by a B monster. And an attempt to make it emotional. Fail fail fail, made me have a bad feeling about the entire series. No ending he deserved. No going out in style.

Sam-grows old? Dean in heaven driving the car and poof Sam's there it's ridiculous!

It was a cash cow and in the end it didn't matter anymore they just wanted to quit. Where are all the good endings? For sure the ""heroes"" can die, but make it good not super sucky. To bad what they did is forever.

I changed my rating from a 7 to a 4,thats how disappointed I got.",figurative
"Evan Peters is one of the best of this generation. There's something dramatic, intense about how that man can transform into his character.

The producer (Ryan Murphy) has been working with Evan for more than a decade on American Horror Story so we've seen him in a few different roles and I'm always stunned at his talent.

Murphy's been known to produce gems or the worst; worth a binge this one.

Only 2 episodes in so my rating might change but this is a solid show with solid acting and even though some might find the start to be ""slow"", if you love creepy thrillers you're in for a wild ride and will love the pace.

Loving the sometimes ""eerie filming"", there's a sinister vibe in every aspects of the show!",figurative
"When it comes to sheer entertainment value and visual beauty, 'Moana' knocks it out of the park Despite being a lifelong Disney fan, that is not to say that everything they've done is great. They've done many classics, their best revolutionary, though they had hit and miss periods in the 80s and the 2000s.

'Enchanted' and 'The Princess and the Frog' saw a return to form, while the likes of 'Tangled', 'Wreck It Ralph', 'Zootropolis' (aka 'Zootopia') and 'Frozen' were even better and there was a lot to like too about 'Big Hero 6'. Of the ""2nd Renaissance""/""Disney Revival"" period, 'Moana' is up there with the best of them and as one of Disney's best in about twenty years.

Maybe the momentum dips ever so slightly going into the final act, Maui's change of heart is a touch rushed and for me there was no real point to the pig character that induced more unintentional awkwardness than amusement. It was however difficult to fault 'Moana', because of how many things it did right and how brilliantly the things it did right were executed. There have been criticisms regarding a formulaic story, HeiHei the chicken being irritating and the portrayal of Maui being stereotypical, but these were criticisms that didn't bother me at all.

Firstly, the animation is phenomenal. Disney's best-looking film in a long time and one of their best-ever looking films, not just this but perhaps the most visually exquisite animated film this year in a year that also saw 'Your Name', 'Kubo' and 'Zootropolis' and even one of the year's best-looking films. The attention to detail is impossible to fault, whether it's the water, the trees or even Maui's tattoos, while the colours just pop out at you and everything is immaculately detailed with not an ounce of artificiality in the backgrounds, further boasting visually stunning sequences such as the climax, ""We Know the Way"", ""Shiny"" and with the coconut pirates.

The soundtrack has garnered a huge amount of praise, and for good reason. Love the evocative orchestration and instrumentation, with its seamless blend of South Pacific Culture, pop and Broadway. Likewise with the songs, which are along with 'Frozen' the best and most consistent set of songs from a Disney film since 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame'. ""How Far I'll Go"" is an ""I want"" sort of song that's infectious, heartfelt and inspiring. ""You're Welcome"" sees Dwayne Johnson showing a quite wide range of emotions through a surprisingly good singing voice. ""Shiny"" is deliciously kooky and like something that David Bowie would be proud of, Jemaine Clement sings the heck out of it. ""We Know the Way"" sends chills up the spine.

Scripting-wise, 'Moana' encompassed a wide emotional range within me. There is something for everybody, never too complicated for children and never too childish for adults, tonally it's focused throughout, and it's very witty and thought-provoking. Throughout there are many opportunities to laugh, cry and be inspired. The story is, while not exactly original, beautifully paced and enthralling.

The whole Polynesian culture, faith and seafaring traditions included and explored generously but in a way that feels part of the story rather than just thrown in, and while there are elements that reminds one of Disney past and present this feels more affectionate than Disney just running out of ideas. The coconut pirates scene may seem like filler, but instead of being incidental and dull filler it was entertaining and visually dazzling, while the musical numbers bring the storytelling forward and say much about the characters' motivations and the climax is hair-raising.

Moana is has now joined the list as one of my favourite female Disney characters, while Maui is a fun, compelling character and the chemistry between the two being a large part of the film's humour and heart. Personally found myself entertained by HeiHei and that his existence and role in the story were justified. If anybody does find him dumb or annoying, this is a rare of those not being bad things for a character clearly intended to be that way from reading up about the film. The voice acting is top notch, with Auli'i Cravalho making a startling debut (voice and singing, goodness she has pipes). Dwayne Johnson, on paper an unlikely and eyebrow-inducing choice, is also splendid, as an actor he's grown a lot, while Alan Tudyk is amusingly zesty and Jemaine Clement bringing gleefully kooky menace.

In summary, knocks it out of the park in visual beauty and sheer entertainment value, Disney does it again with their latest classic 'Moana'. 9/10 Bethany Cox",figurative
"Honest Review It was bad - I watch The Kardashian's show on Hulu, and I'm not a Kim hater. The premise of this show is good, and I wanted to like it, but Kim can't act. No facial expressions at all - no personality. She could've been in the cast, but not the star of the show, and it might've been watchable. I watched the first show and part of the second, and I had to turn it off.",literal
"Very Enjoyable-The lead actress is fantastic I had been looking forward to this series since it was announced, and I wasn't disappointed in the slightest. Suffice to say I binged watched it in 2 days.

The story caters, of course , to the modern audience, but it is not smothered by political correctness as most current shows are (which is a blessing). It is interesting, dark, and a blend of old and new, all wrapped in a fun Burton-esque way.

The lead actress is fantastic, she really captures the personality of Wednesday, she even nails the dead, cold but intense stare. But kudos should be given to the rest of the cast, because they do a great job as well,I loved Gwendoline Christie as the Head Mistress, she really plays ambiguous characters very well. Catherine Zeta-Jones and Luis Guzman are perfect in their roles, and the actress who portrays Enid (Emma Myers) nails the character.

Of course there are mistakes and inconsistencies (a rainy day suddenly becoming extra sunny, with no evidence of the previous rain at all, etc), but all in all, those mistakes don't negatively affect the quality of the series.

I really don't understand the viewers who compare it to the movies, and expect it to be the same. It can't be. It's been 30 years since the Addams Family movies, the world has changed, we are supposed to be moving forward and keeping up with the times. Please stop comparing old and new, ""Wednesday"" isn't a remake, it's a brand new series based on one of the characters, not the Addams Family as a whole. This series, pays a great homage to the original Addams Family, but it is firmly set in the present- as it should be.

Old and new can be equally worth your time, each one for its own merits.

8/10 from me, with the potential to go higher for the next season(s).",literal
"Smiling Friends ""Smiling Friends"" is quite possibly the worst thing I've ever had the displeasure of wasting my time on. It is an abomination of a show that should never have been allowed to see the light of day. The animation is subpar, the writing is lazy, and the characters are about as likable as a root canal. The supposed ""humor"" falls flat and is as predictable as the sun rising in the east. Avoid at all costs unless you want to subject yourself to 11 minutes of pure agony. And even then, why bother when you could just gouge your eyes out with a plastic spoon instead? It would be a more pleasant experience.",figurative
"Would be a 9/10 without the last 2 seasons Excellent show up until the end. The first several seasons of Shameless are some of the best, most fun episodes of television I've ever seen. The last season might be the worst... yes it's that bad.

Put it this way. If you want to enjoy a great plot, good acting, crazy storylines and experience a wide range of emotions, watch this show than stop before the last 2 seasons (at least the last one).

If you are watching shows to be taught a lesson about how white people are bad, flip to the last season! It's pretty much 90% of the show. I genuinely thought it was a parody at one point. Really disappointing end to an otherwise great show.",literal
"Just Okay I mean, no serious plot holes, and some solid acting on behalf of most of the cast, , but nothing stellar, either. A pretty solid, average score of 5.

Surprisingly, I find Ryder's acting to be the most irritating out of anyone's in the cast. She strikes me as shrill, with very little nuance. I think the series would be much better without her.",literal
"Overhyped I think that the movie was overhyped. It felt like there was just something missing and maybe because I watch a lot of series and get to enjoy the progression of characters overtime. That's why I felt like there was something missing. I think that the actors were great and maybe during the storyline there was way too much focus on her job aspect and there could've been just a little bit more of her personal life being expressed on screen. I honestly think the trailer was probably better than the movie and I found myself getting a little bit bored at times. I think that this was a great trio, but I don't know if that this was the perfect movie for them.",literal
"I hope for a 2nd movie WOW, this movie was really beautiful. And also funny and sad at the same time. I would have given this movie a 10 if only the girl and the guy could have kissed in their song or when he died saving the girl. That gave me the feels of love. I really hope that there will be someday a second movie because I know there is now a somewhat love story. Evil never dies so maybe a pause to come back and get more humor and action but also romance. Because the song ""FREE"" really show the emotional feeling of the movie. And I also loved the song ""Your Idol"". That song was evil but really good. I really liked this movie. I hope Netflix makes another musical but not just action and humor but also bring in the romance also. Such a really good movie.",literal
"classic arnie, 80's action movie Adapted from a stephen king book (written under his richard bachman pseudonym), set in the future of 2017 and 2019, the movie tells the story of richard, played by arnold schwarzenegger, a wrongfully sentenced cop for killing innocent people. He escapes prison but is caught. He is forced to enter a tv game show called the running man. It is everything what you can expect from a 80's action movie. It has violence, our main hero: arnold schwarzenegger and of course lot's of one liners. If you don't take this movie too serious, you will be able to enjoy it. Just keep in mind that this movie was created in an era where films were made a certain way. It's also kinda fun to watch this movie in 2019, where the story is supposedly set.",literal
"I want more Smashed the first two episodes and look forward to more. Looks amazing and feels claustrophobic, there is a real visual separation between the work and home self. Dialogue is witty and sharp, the fact that Ben Stiller directed this blows my mind. Great TV to kick off 2022.",literal
"Loved it This was honestly one of the best shows I've seen in awhile! The cast and story line is amazing. It's an emotional roller coaster that's for sure, you will fall in and out of love with the characters. I give this a ten and hope they win some awards. The ending had me in tears, if you have rocky relationships with your siblings you will understand what I mean! Truly a must watch show!",literal
"Surprisingly good! Songs are 10/10! I never like Kpop, to be honest. I only hear some hit songs while shopping and I don't even know how many people are there in BTS or Black pink...

But! This film totally wins my heart!

I mean, come on! Demon Hunters + Pop stars! Who doesn't love this?

The story is super simple, simple and could be a bit cliché. But the music production is totally on top level.

Even for a person like who is so unfamiliar with Kpop could tell the tune.

Overall, the film is quite short, no fuss, really suitable for this type of action animations.

It doesn't spend looong time to explain all the details but that's the whole point! People are shouting out for sequels online now, unlike the recent Disney style which makes audiences beg for No More Useless Sequels!

I'd like to thank the production team brought back something we've been missing for a long time: MAKE YOUR POINT.

Sometimes that's what all a good film needs.

I'm not looking forward to any sequels because this one is classic!",literal
"Lives up to all the hype Stranger Things absolutely lives up to all the hype! This worldwide phenomenon has been one of the most talked about shows since it came out back in 2016 and for good reason...it's terrific! It's an absolute blast to watch and will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. This has everything a show needs to be great...action, comedy, drama, suspense, even nostalgia with this show. You really come to care for these characters and what happens to them. Obviously, season 1 was the best but the others are not far off. All are absolutely worth watching and I can't wait for the new season! Season 5 of s going to be its last so hopefully it goes out as good as it started. I can't wait!",literal
"A Highly Unique, Original Series With so many jobs taking place in office buildings, this television series that is based on the Ricky Gervais created BBC series, takes aim at that and other aspects of the modern American workplace. Steve Carrell leads a large cast of talented actors that succeed in creating a smart, silly comedy that works.

Carrell is Michael Scott, the dim-witted boss of paper company Dunder Mifflin's Scranton, Pennsylvania branch. Rainn Wilson is Scott's odd second in command Dwight Shrute, a man who prides himself on knowledge of survival techniques and bears. Jim Krasinski is Jim Halpert, a salesman who has a crush on Pam(Jenna Schafer), the receptionist. These are only a few of the major characters in the ongoing, hilarious saga of Scranton at work.

Several story lines can take place in the course of a single episode, giving the show more chances at laughs. In one episode, for example, there are conflicts between members of the Party Planning Committee, Michael's usual antics of procrastination, and the secrets of two characters's affair. These just make the show more original than ones that have a single narrative.

Funny and intelligent, The Office is one brilliant spoof you should not miss.",literal
"Really lame and just blah story Story was blah Lame and just stupid.

Alicia silver stone was cute and really this would have been way better with the story line not going to route it did.

Acting was good and filming good but the while ex mas leading to a rekindling is such a predictable sad pathetic story line.

I just can't with this kinda romcom it's unrealistic.

Its cringe.",literal
"kind of entertaining but writing is not awesome Every. Single. Episode. Someone yells, FBI, we just want to ask some questions- and ooooffff goes the guy, here comes the standard hunt shuffle and catch. Every episode!

Then, I actually like the characters a lot, but why is Jeremy Sisto screaming like a lower school football coach every time there is a case? As if he doesnt have a team of really good people around him knowing what to do.

After 4 seasons, we are giving up on this show soon, really no season 5 needed, thank you very much!",literal
"What should I say? 10/10 acting, 10/10 characters, every Episode has been amazing (Especialy Ozymandias, Felina, 4 Days Out, Pilot etc..) Vince Gilligan made one of the greatest fictional characters ever like Walter White, Gustavo Fring and Saul Goodman AND also the best ever rated TV episode Ozymandias which has an 10/10 rating on here. I trurly enjoyed watching this Series and Im kinda sad that I finished it, I just wish sometimes that I forget the whole Story so I can watch it all over again. I cant wait to watch Better Call Saul and El Camino and who knows, maybe we could get surprised with an Gus Fring Series too.",literal
"Ross is an idiot Ross Poldark is an idiot. Everyone and everything is of utmost importance to him, except for his own wife and family. At every turn he decides to help somebody, with no regard to how it will affect Demelza. It's very obvious no matter what he says to her, that in reality she matters little to him. How he would choose Elizabeth over her is unfathomable. Demelza is beautiful, smart, very strong, and caring. Elizabeth is barely attractive, selfish and cold. She and George deserve each other. My only other complaint is, nobody ever kills George. WTF.",literal
"Incredible Second Season The second season definitely lived up to the high standards set by the first. The performances, particularly from the actors playing the brothers, were incredibly nuanced and compelling, elevating the emotional intensity of the show. Each scene served a purpose, with none feeling out of place, keeping me captivated from start to finish. The storytelling continues to be one of the show's strongest aspects, offering a fresh and insightful perspective on the case. This season deepens the emotional and psychological layers, making it a must-watch for any person. I absolutely loved it, incredible work from every person that worked on the project.",literal
"MARMITE - love it or hate it. Okay - I have watched up to and including Episode 4 but enough is enough. Most other reviewers have covered the good and not so good points- and I am curious to know how it ends. However I can't sit through another 6 episodes of mumbling and quiet speaking or whispering. Audio is 50% of a film and it isn't working if you are straining constantly to hear what the actors are saying. Ok - yes, I could put on the subtitles, but should I have to? No, not for an English speaking TV series. With even better and more sophisticated sound recording equipment why is it so difficult for sound engineers to get the balance correct! So the plan is to read the plot lines of Episodes 5 to 9 and then try and watch Episode 10. Wish me luck!",literal
"Creepy and Intense Didn't think I would like this movie but boy was I wrong! Very heartfelt and creepy. I'm very hard on ratimg movies these days, but I have to be honest here! The first movie is the reason I went to watch this movie because I liked it! I almost never like the second movie but I actually thought this one was better than the first one. Go and watch it for yourself. Don't let the bad reviews have you miss out on a good movie! I watched it in Dolby atmos and it was incredible!!",literal
"What did I watch. I like giving new shows a chance. There were two episodes of this on our DVR. We tried the first episode tonight.

I kept saying how good it was. That it seemed interesting. At the twenty-five- or thirty-minute mark, I said ""this show is starting to get stupid."" Then after some more time, I said ""this is never going to make it."" My mom and stepfather told me I didn't have to record any more. But I already have the second episode and don't like to give up right away.

The show just seems meaningless. I mean really, what was the point. No action. No drama. No comedy. Just mindless ramblings of words. It was useless.

There is a thing with him and a lady. I just rolled my eyes. I mean, is it going anywhere. To me, it just seems like there were a bunch of things put it to fill the time since there was no story at all.

There is no heart in it.

As I said, there is a second episode recorded and I had already set the third. But if the next is anything like the first, there is no way we are going to finish it. If the show has the rest of the season as the first was, I would be shocked it this makes it to a second or third season.",figurative
"I need to quit you Criminal Minds I have watched every single episode of Criminal Minds up until this past season. I have enjoyed the intricate plots, the character development, the story lines. I have to say that over the last year, the whole feel of the show has completely changed. Too many character departures, too many new character faces, and now Reid in jail? Come on Criminal Minds. I just can't anymore. I am not enjoying it at all anymore and I couldn't finish the season. So, now I have decided that I have to quit you. And in all honesty, I don't know if I'll miss you.",literal
"What a book to movie adaption. These actors did an incredible job bringing this book to screen! Loved it all! This will be a constant rewatch. This movie brought all the WHAT, Awe's, Laughs, & tears the book did. If you've not read the book the movie will be great but the ending might seem a little rushed to you......but not to true fans of the books. Absolutely LOVED Lexie's energy! Great job!!",literal
"Solid - But No Empathy - Firstly watched with the daughter (16) and missus and they both enjoyed it more than me... reasons? Well the film is interesting premise, well acted, well shot... and dives into the walk straight away very little wiggle room. However I think where it falls down is once stuff happens... I simply didn't have any empathy with any of the characters and I';m not sure why? Pete is the strongest of them both in acting ability and character, however I found it difficult to be invested in what actually happens to 99% of the cast and that is a problem with a people film? As said in a previous review, I would also add, I think we needed to learn more about the world this was happening in DURING the walk... and things that had happened, maybe some short flashbacks just to flush this story out as right now, we barely know a thing. Now, does this really matter on this one? Possibly not, but as I wasn't invested in the people as much as I should've been, maybe knowing the heart ache and things that the lads had been through a little more and seeing it... and why we're really doing this walk would've helped. I also think, do they indeed get riches? What happens to previous winners? Os is this like the running man where they get walloped whether they win or lose? Who knows. Anyhow, solid film, missed opportunity but good performances and at least tries to do something new and refreshing in an era or poor Hollywood films.",literal
"Strong potential but dull reality (so far) As a long-time fan of historical and occult mystery thriller shows (Frontier, X-Files) I was stoked for and in turn let down a bit by this one. The show itself has a ton of potential as the setting, visuals, sounds, cast and original premise are 10/10 and the first two episodes had me hooked for more (I'd give them 8/10), but then the quality of acting and writing drops severely and makes you become painfully aware of it. There is some improvement by 5th episode though which has me hoping the show can get itself back on track by the season finale.

EP1 - 2 8/10 EP3 - 4 4/10 EP5 - 6/10 EP6 - to be seen

+ Visuals, Setting, Cast, Premise


* Bad acting (antagonists, Emma), Bad writing (dull, you don't become emotionally invested), Unused potential of Navajo witches lore (much more chilling, look up r/skinwalkers subbreddit for more)


So far it's been like playing an RPG game and being able to equip your character with the most legendary set items right away yet lacking the ability to use even the most basic skills and combos to destroy your enemies. Matten and McClaron are stars-in-the-making and the premise is strong, if the show solves it's script problems it could become a hit by season 2, the potential is definitely there. In the meanwhile, I'd recommend watching S01E19 of X-Files for a proper show of paranormal crime story with a flair of societal commentary on the situation and treatment of native communities.",literal
"Visual Storytelling So many visual details, big ones, mid ones, small ones, all the way to smallest ones. All those that tell the story, or support telling the story, without saying a word, while build the world at the same time. Things like entering the premises (Super Duper Mart) through the hole in the fence instead the entrance, or is the sun high up, lower or low in the sky, or the difference that blanket made with Gulper's digestion, or maybe some sound, when the exact same tune plays in the background in different occasions pointing to The Reveal, before ""the reveal"", or following characters around all the wreckage like cars, trucks and buses, on their path, except in rare cases, or particular one case, from inside the bus, ""being observerd"" style, or getting rad sickness only after submerged into and drank water, or putting the chip in the head now, with no intention to escape now, or heading directly to location of the suit after airdropped in the middle of the town, or...,

many more..",literal
"First Episode Says It All Just finished the first episode - and wow, it really shows how bad this is. A plane supposedly carrying 20 prisoners crashes... and somehow 100 guys walk out of it?? WTF! 😂 And that one dude who went to the hospital with his eyes all bandaged up - turns out he was faking it the whole time! Like seriously, no doctor even checked him while he was chilling there for hours with his ""blindfold""? Unreal.",literal
"Way Too Rushed Unfortunately there isn't much that separates this film from any other generic superhero movie. The plot is down to its bare bones. Honestly, I think you could fit all the content from this movie on a standard sized post-it note and leave nothing out. The characters have been boiled down to pure archetypes with little to no personality added and they're as dynamic as action figures that you simply move from set-piece to set-piece. There are some solid action sequences through out, but the finale left me incredibly disappointed. I've wanted to truly see Galactus on the big screen for so long and I would have been happier if I was still waiting. They absolutely butchered him as a character and that was the most disappointing part overall. There could have been so much more here, but what little there is comes across as generic and empty.",literal
"Stop at Season 2. Season 3 is a joke Season 1 = 9/10, season 2 = 7/10, season 3 = 2/10. Season 3 what a joke. No plot, no story, nothing new, cheesy, cliche, just plain annoying dialogues, illogical, cringey. CRINGEY! What a woeful, horrid season. Writers and producers should be ashamed.",literal
"Decent Samurai series I enjoyed watching Last Samurai, It had everything you could ask for if you're into Samurai stories. It wasn't impressive but good overall.

I like Samurai stories and historic-action series/movies like ""Kingdom"" or ""Murky stream"" being on top of that list and this show didn't disappoint.

I give it a 7 you maybe reading this and wondering because it was too short, 6 episodes -sorry to say-, just doesn't seem right, it left the story incomplete despite another season coming. Lot of important character left undiscovered and why they're doing what they're doing, why are they turning on Samurai? Six episodes barely gave us enough time to discover the story and thus, the pacing felt out of the place. A 10 or 12 episodes would've been better.

Another reason is that guy who calls himself ""Strategist"" or something, he's just a bad actor or to be more specific, he doesn't fit that role. His accent sounds weird and even for us viewers, you can feel like he's not living the character but rather just acting; I don't about you but that's how i felt. Even that young actress Fubaka,it seems like this is her first acting role but whatever.

Overall, looking forward to season 2.",literal
"Idiots, Idiots, IDIOTS Great original series before getting cancelled but revamped and rewritten for idiots. Originally a great series but in the 16th season everyone in the series lost the common decency that they had for 15 years and then became foul mouthed. In real life such a change is highly unlikely. They are now all unsubs because some sort of stresser has caused unnatural behaviour in the BAU universe. They writers have forgotten the core fan base and like many other fairly decent (decent in the truest meaning of the word) shows and films it has become obscene to satisfy only one type of people. Those who only love and crave obscenity. Go back to the roots please. I really would like the Pg13/tv14 version back. I used to watch this with my kids. Please don't do an edited version just film the darn show as it used to be filmed for crying out loud.",literal
"Started pretty shaky, but is much improved I was ready to write this show off after 2 episodes, but I glad I didn't. Someone must have heard all of the negative comments (mostly between me and my wife) around Sela Ward's and Jeremy Sisto's characters and how everything they did and said was WAY over the top. Starting in episode 3 they dialed their acting way back and the dialogue became more realistic and their actions more convincing.

I originally started watching this show because of Missy Peregrym (loved her in Reaper and Rookie Blue) and I really like the chemistry between agents Bell and Zidan, but after the firsts 2 episodes I didn't think it would last 1/2 a season. Now I really hope it has a long run.",literal
"An Above Average Easy Watch For the last month or so, I have been watching a new show on Disney Plus call Chad Powers and the finale was today and I have watched that so here is my review for the whole season of Chad Powers. The premise of the show sees a disgraced former quarter back aim to get back to playing football under a new identity.

Main Character Glen Powell is one of the hottest commodities in Hollywood at the moment and can pretty much pick any project he wants and he is Chad Powers. He is easily the best part of this show and his star power shines through some of the other elements of the show, he really delivers a mix between comedy and drama and really excels, especially at the surprising dramatic moments.

Supporting Characters Perry Matfield plays Ricky a female coach who takes a liking to Chad. Though there is more to her character then that, she is going through her own character arc and that works alongside the arc of Chad. The two of them have great chemistry and are a real highlight of the show.

Steve Zahn plays Coach Hudson and he is a fun character here. He is really feeling the pressure of being the coach of an American Football Team and he really sells it well. He is pretty charming but always on edge and it works for him.

Unfortunately, the rest of the cast aren't so good. Wynn Everett plays Tricia and she is super unlikeable. She sees herself above everybody else in the show but not in a charming way but in a way that made me dislike her character.

Frankie A. Rodriguez plays Danny and he is the closest friend to Chad and honestly I found him quite over the top and annoying for the most part. I just didn't really buy into their relationship and it is the one part of the show that didn't quite hit for me.

Story The story has some good character arcs that make you care about Chad and some of the people around him. The finale has some interesting turns that really subvert expectations of a show like this and I really appreciated that. However, this show is pretty predictable throughout and some of the character were pretty annoying throughout. Also, the ending of the show is disappointing and feels like it is just setting up a second season.

Script This show has some really surprising heartfelt moments that are written really well and flesh out the characters. But this show is focusing on comedy and I barely laughed throughout, the writing is weak and just not very funny which is a big shame when your show is mainly a comedy.

Style The show flies by with its pacing which is both good and bad. Certain episodes, especially when it focuses on the actual football, I really enjoyed the fast pace and way the show is shot. But at times it feels like it is rushing itself and doesn't give certain aspects of the show the time that it needs.

Overall Overall, Chad Powers is an above average show that has some potential. Some good performances and surprisingly heartfelt moments help this but it isn't funny enough or memorable enough to watch. If a second season gets announced then maybe give it a go as it is an easy and quick watch.

Rating - 6/10.",figurative
"Michael Scott meets Happy Gilmore The protagonist Ron makes me think of what you'd get if Michael Scott and Happy Gilmore had a baby. Off-color and off-target casually inappropriate office comments combined with barely controlled bouts of rage. The guy is a walking trainwreck, and I'm not sure why he was entrusted with a high-profile project. Still, it is funny at times.

The rest of Ron's co-workers are also similarly afflicted with farcical exaggerations of common maladies and also have wildly irrational reactions. ""You handed me that envelope too hard.""

Odd as it is to consider chair quality when watching a conspiracy show, Ron's inciting event seems very improbable. Several components of the chair seem to have failed at once. I've never seen anything even remotely close happen with even semi-modern office chairs. I have seen the reclining regulator fail on a chair once, causing the person to spill out backwards, but not several components catastrophically failing at once. Still, it was funny, and I suppose I'm over-thinking it since this is a comedy.

Ron also seems to be more than a little bipolar, and possibly an alcoholic. Two things that rarely go well together and might explain his unacceptable office behavior.

I'm at 6/10 after two episodes. The show is going to have to do something different soon to keep me watching.",figurative
"Another Hit for Taylor Sheridan When it comes to realism, most shows gloss over it while Taylor Sheridan embraces it. The oil and gas industry are not only dangerous in the field but in the board room as well. The risks are high and the rewards are too! Add in a splash of greed and a little hint of sex appeal and you have yourself a GREATLY addicting show!

Billy Bob Thornton and Jon Hamm have stellar performances as they embrace the Yin and Yang of this harsh industry. Let's not forget the ladies in the mix. They are truly the backbone of the series. Ali's character and Katy's character come from two different worlds but both eventually get a deeper glimpse behind the curtain as they step out onto the patch to see what life is truly like out there for the men in the field who risk it all.

This show gives us all a bit more appreciation for these thankless jobs done by some of the bravest people out there. It also doesn't shy away from the darker side of things either. There were so many times my heart leapt from my chest when a grand accident would occur. The aftermath of these things is often felt on so many levels including with myself as I sit here heartbroken for the characters affected.

The difference in this series versus Yellowstone is the intensity. Landman is a bit more lighthearted with Tommy's quips and his daughter's flimsy charms. The stakes are higher and on a larger scale but these characters are definitely on a more relatable scale. As a Texas gal, I can definitely say they hit the nail on the head with how they portray this life and I'm super excited to see where it all goes next!",literal
"Good acting but too irritating and slow. Apart from rhe good acting, everything else is irritating, the music moments are way too loud, yoi develop no sympathy for the actor so don't care, although you wish she was 'removed' asap. The chapter with the barking dog almost got us walking pit as it was so irritating to hear it bark all the time.

Overall depressing and uninteresting weak story.

I am sure no one can understand depression as it is a very personalnissue. There is no need to impose this burdrn on others like this film does.",literal
"Likable family film with plenty of amusing moments and the young cast are appealing. Tommy Smalls (Tom Guiry) is the new kid, who moved with his mother (Karen Allen) and his stepfather (Denis Leary) is a suburbans area of Salt Lake City in the summertime. When Smalls becomes curious with a group of kids (Mike Vitar, Patrick Renna, Chauncey Leopardi, Marty York, Brandon Quintin Adams, Grant Gelt, Shane Obedzinski and Victor DiMattia), who plays Baseball all day long in a old baseball field. Smalls is hoping to play with them but he knows nothing about the game. When he tries to play, he's quite bad at all. He can't even throw a ball to the catchers. When he becomes friend with the leader of the game and Smalls starting to like the game. But when his stepfather goes away for business, Smalls take a baseball from his stepfather trophy room. Which without realizing that the ball, he took from the room is actually signed by the Baseball Legend ""Babe Ruth"". Smalls hits his first home run, the ball went over the fence of a old house. But that old house, it has an mean-spirited junkyard dog. Which the kids called him ""The Beast"". Now the kids have to help Smalls to get the ball back before his stepfather comes back from the business trip.

Directed by David M. Evans (First Kid) made an likable family comedy that plenty of funny moments, a good cast and a lot of imagination. The narration of the film will certainly make you remember of the late Bob Clark film ""A Christmas Story"", although the narration of ""The Sandlot"" is sightly heavy-handed at times. This film has a surprise hit, when it was release in the spring of 1993. Fox had another fantasy film about Baseball, which it was ""Rookie of the Year"". James Earl Jones, Art LaFleur and a young Marley Shelton have memorable bit parts in this pleasant comedy as well.

DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer (Also in Pan & Scan) and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD also includes an featurette, trailer and TV spots. This film went on to be an modest classic over the year. All the kids have their moments, especially Renna and Leopardi have their comedic moments. The movie slows down a bit during the second act. But it's well made and this picture pleases everyone as well. It's one of the better family movies of the 1990's. Don't miss it. Co-Written by the director. Arliss Howard appears Unbilled. Followed by Two Direct to DVD's. Joe-Dunton-Camera Scope (J-D-C Scope). (****/*****).",figurative
"You become hooked into it! At first I thought it was series about teenage kids and was going to be them typical teenage series but in fact I found is great! You get to know the characters and really makes you build a bond for them. I thought it was going to be scary but surprisingly I could watch this well since it carries a good story line. It's got a great 80s vibe especially with the clothing! The last series was much more action and a few different story lines happening at once that drawers you right in! Gutted I've watched it all, now to wait for the next season!",literal
"First two seasons were very good Season 3 is absolutely atrocious. It is slow. There are no likable characters. The entire season seems like a waste of time. Everyone is either frightened, stupid, or vacuous. I keep watching only because I have come this far hoping something will happen. Season 3 is the worst of the series.

I don't know how the producers can expect people to stick with a series that is so bereft of an interesting plot. Its like each episode is trying to extend itself for 45 minutes.

I am very disappointed in this season because the first two were so entertaining. Not only are the characters not interesting, they are downright unlikable. Don't waste your time.",literal
"It's a tired old space for..... I hope this isn't a spoiler but I'm sure you've seen the trailer...It's a ""From Dusk till Dawn"" ripoff that is looking for a new audience. There's no twists here. It's redeeming feature is it's time setting, 1930's, but once you get into the ""bar"" it's a genre piece with no new content. Using the same actor in ""twin"" roles has been done before and better. The rest of the casts' acting is solid enough but it runs out of steam well before it's 137min running time does. I saw it at the cinema and the soundscape was solid enough but that's not sufficiently engrossing to keep you anywhere near the edge of your seat. I've given it a six star rating which us possibly a bit generous, but we all love vampire movies don't we, even if there are more of them in films and series than us actually watching them these days. It's fun but it's nothing new to the genre so don't go in with high expectations, and you'll not be let down. I wasn't looking at my watch but I would have missed nothing if I left to get some popcorn. My brother gave it a 7, but he's a generous chap. It'll be streaming somewhere soon so don't rush out but if you wanna go to the movies, you could definitely do a lot worse.",literal
"Uncomfortable, Unlikable and Frustrating IF I HAD LEGS ID KICK YOU I

Oh how much I wanted to like this. Rose Byrne is one of my favs.

One of the more frustrating and uncomfortable films of this year, If I Had Legs Id Kick You is an exercise in exasperation. Rose Byrne one of the finest actresses today does everything she can but the central character is incredibly unlikable that it's misguided that the film thinks there's anything sympathetic about her story. Mary Bronstein goes intense and raw but comes up with a very awkwardly miserable drama.

Why was everyone in this film so rude, crass and unlikable?

The kid was incredibly unlikeable.

Doesn't really give the therapy system a good overview does it? I mean the lead character's treatment of her patients is beyond unprofessional and mean.

The lead - where does one start - she was just mean. Having mental health issues doesn't give someone a justification to be cruel, rude and mean spirited and she is throughout the entire movie. That's the issue - there's nothing sympathetic about what she's going through.

It's irresponsible.",literal

Every time we've been to the cinema the past few months and the Wicked trailer came on my wife got child like giddy because she loves the show and I've thought 'oh God that's one of those I have to sit through because to be fair she sits through most of mine moments'. So I've been counting the days and dreading, and when I heard the runtime I was even more distraught. I wanted to hate this movie with every bone in my body for a few reasons.

1. Not a fan of musicals (but I can grimace through them sometimes).

2. I love Wizard of Oz in its purest form and didn't want the legacy of it spoiling.

3. My wife's choices of films are more often than not 'questionable'.

4. Two hours plus in a cinema seat these days doesn't do my back any good at my age.

5. Ariana Grande.

Now being a realist my first impression of the movie might be a little offset because I went in with such low expectations as I've done this before on numerous occasions, but call me a softy in my old age (I'm 47) I absolutley loved it!!! Everything from the phenomenal soundtrack, set design, make up, costumes,comedy elements, character design etc...i could go on, you get the gist. It was brilliant, I may even go watching it again (the highest accolade I can give for a two hours plus movie) and I can't wait for part 2. A few purists have got thier complaints and gripes which there will always be on adaptations of previous pre-loved formats. But no complaints here, just a very good, well made movie. Wizard of Oz's legacy intact.

One more point...Ariana Grande steals it for me. Perfect casting!!!",literal
"Just Fantastic I'll be honest, I overlooked this one. I pride myself on knowing what's coming out and when but I just had not spotted that Derek Cianfrance had a film out this year.

I've been a 'film buff' my whole life and people like me will know Derek Cianfrance from The Place Beyond the Pines and The Light Between Oceans. He has a certain way of communicating a personal drama that I seem to connect with very closely.

Roofman is an exceptional film, the story was engaging from the first moment and I became completely lost in the drama that unfolded.

I'd also like to shout out Channing Tatum who I think can be an incredibly effective actor. I'm not a Jump Street man but I am a Foxcatcher man and I'd like to see Channing in more roles like this.

I'd honestly put this straight into my top 10 for this year. Just brilliant.",figurative
"Who is doing make up Not sure who is doing the make up for the Season 7 Episode 1 but it is atrocious. Especially on Jeremy Sisto. Yuck. He looks like he is two different people between his face and neck. Way too dark and shiny.

I am really sad Tiff is leaving. I liked her character.

I can't say how annoying it is to have to use 600 words to write a review. Maybe people don't have 600 words to write.

Some of the episodes feel rushed. I almost wish that they would make it 2 episodes to develop the story more. I know the FBI is good but some cases need more development for the episodes.

The crossover episodes are the best.",literal
"Claire, go to acting school. Please I agree with other viewers that Claire Danes is just recycling her Homeland role. She's over-the-top neurotic in every scene. I loved Matthew Rhys in everything I've seen him in, but I decided I couldn't get past episode one. He's not the problem; it's the reiteration of Carrie. Her weird personality didn't bother me so much in Homeland because it was offset by the rest of the wonderful cast & the suspense. But i immediately knew that Niall was going to kill the drunk driver as soon as he laid eyes on him. No suspense there. If it turns out he didn't do it, I'll never know because I'm not going to watch the rest of it.",literal
"What a shame I was really enjoying it up to a certain point. Then oz entered, exposed himself and the cringe set in. Its a shame because I believe I would have loved this series but there are deceptions I wont tolerate. Are there boxes that need to be ticked? Is it the blatant dominance and control and just all out discrimination force fed to the population. I don't believe and I wont support. Those that know, know. The rest have their heads in the sand. The end.",literal
"""From Nobody to Everybody bleeding."" Nobody 2 is a sequel that feels funnier than the first film. The screenplay follows a similar pattern, but this time the action is bigger, bloodier, and more violent. The movie moves at a quick pace without slowing down, and the scale of the events feels much larger. Visually, it's more colorful than the first part, and with its short runtime, it delivers a fast, fun, and blood-soaked action ride - even though the template remains the same. What makes it even better is that the story also gives proper importance to Hutch's family, making it more engaging. The humor blends nicely with the action, keeping the movie entertaining throughout.",literal
"Great show!!! Just finished binge watching Shameless and I absolutely loved it. The acting was amazing, especially from William H. Macey! If you're easily offended, don't like dark humor and don't like soft porn, don't watch it lol. You really get to know all the characters. You grow from liking a character to wanting to slap them......and then you like them again. I loved seeing cameos from people I know from other shows to. My favorite characters will and always will be Lip and Kevin. I know, I know but, I have my reasons. Y'all definitely need to watch this show if you haven't already, you will not regret it.",literal
"Derivative Drivel The premise of a hidden genius amongst us that is suddenly discovered is as old as the hills, and as tired as walking up them.

The main character is simply not believable. She has contradictory traits that don't pan out in the script. Supposedly she has trouble having conversations but has no trouble having conversations. She knows lots of obscure facts with detail, but doesn't understand the basics of police work. Very unlikely for someone with an IQ of 160 to have never looked at anything to do with police procedure and rules of evidence.

The pace of the show is rushed. The acting of the main support in the cast, her atagonist, looks like he is tired of the script and doesn't believe in the character he is playing, and that comes through in his acting.

The plots are highly contrived and don't give you the sense the main character had to do much to crack them, thus making the plots lightweight and trivial. Nothing happens to give the watcher a ""wow"" moment.",literal
"One of the best movies of the year OK, I just got back from seeing it. Overall, I loved it. I think it's one of the best movies of 2025

Firstly - I'll note that I know nothing about the book by Stephen King. Thus, I entered this movie with a blank slate about the subject matter, and I have no comparisons between the movie and book. I don't know if that detail made the movie better or worse for me.

Anyways - the premise of the movie, for me, is interesting and original; I can't say that I recall too many movies like this one (though there are elements of movies /shows like Squid Game). The general vibe is unique. It's neither a war movie or a road trip movie, yet it actually has the atmosphere of both sub-genres mixed into one, which works

The 2 lead characters - Ray and Pete - are likable; and their friendship (which forms the crux of the movie) is touching. With this premise, a major concern was that the movie might get dull after the first 30 minutes or so: how interesting can you make a long walk appear on-screen? But the movie skillfully manages to keep a good pace with the charming and well-written dialogue or banter between the various characters.

The movie occurs on a nondescript road in a nondescript area, yet there are still some scenes where the setting appears scenic and elegant. There's a lot of gore and gross scenes relating to human excrement. I could see an argument that some of those scenes are gratituitious. But I feel those scenes helped set the ominous atmosphere. Additionally, Mark Hamill is alright as the villain, though one attempt to give info about his background seems forced (it happens near the end. I don't want to spoil and say more)

The ending is ambiguous, which might not work for some. But I like it: I think the ending is open for interpretation. And it will hit your emotional strings unless you have no soul.

In terms of flaws - I have just one. As I said, the movie manages to keep a good pace in spite of the monotonous premise relating to a long walk. But still - the last 25% of the movie includes some repetitive scenes. What happens is that someone on the walk freaks out or gets close to dropping out, and the 2 lead protagonists jump in to save the day or console them. Then the character who drops out gets an emotional death. I feel they should have cut one or two of these scenes to eliminate retread

Still, one of the best movies of 2025

10/10.",literal
"unfunny sex comedy In Victorian London, Josephie Pacefoot (Joanna Pettet) leads the purity girls in demanding reform to save women from sex work. Flying enthusiast Benjamin Oakes (David Hemmings) comes to the rescue of Josephie and her fallen women. Various recollection of women 'suffering' their poor indignities perpetrated by men sometimes played by David Hemmings. He has an evil doppelganger.

It's a sex comedy and it's an odd one. The central theme is that these women are being taken advantaged by these men. In the recreations, the women are gleefully being 'taken advantaged'. It's not a funny joke. The choppy nature of the film doesn't help. It's one vignette after another and few are even mildly funny. I don't care about Josephie and Benjamin. The plot does sometimes take interesting turns, but I still don't care. It's an unfunny sex comedy.",literal
"Love this show Watched one and episode and binged both seasons in two days. Hooked!!!! Short seasons very few episodes, but glad it was picked up for a third season! Def recommend watching it! I'm all in for the next one.... it's truly like a show I've never watched before. But the Acting was great., it kept a pretty good storyline with both seasons.

I like the characters and you can definitely feel with what they went through.

It's a show I hope they don't cut after just a few seasons because they usually do that to shows I get into

Keep this one going it's a very good show..

I love a good period piece and like that it feels right in that era.",literal
"for what it is, an excellent film I'm pretty surprised that this film is rated as low on IMDb as it is--especially since this is one of Arnold's better films. I think part of the problem is that some people MIGHT be looking at the film from a superficial and purely aesthetic level, whereas I see a lot more depth in this movie than many viewers. Yes the film is violent and dopey but that's exactly the point! Just like the original (and only one worth watching) ROLLERBALL, the film was dismissed by some because of the film's violence and seeming banality whereas the film really is a great indictment about society. And, on that level, the film is great. I could actually see people in our country, especially in the near future, intoxicated by the violence of a show dedicated to watching men die. Is this really that much of a leap from Jerry Springer and the evening news? 

And, if you look at the film technically, it's well-made. Arnold is just fine with this role, the direction is great, Steven King's story is excellent and Richard Dawson just steals the show as the sleazy and creepy host of this show dedicated to making capital punishment a spectator sport! 

So, try watching this film and think to yourself--could this really make it on TV? I think YES, as our world really isn't that far removed from the Romans and their Coliseums.

UPDATE--I just saw this movie again and I think my original review was too optimistic. While I had given it a 9, now I think 6 or 7 is probably more accurate. While I agree there is some good social commentary, the film had too many holes and silly plot points when I saw it again. Still, not bad brain candy.",figurative
"CGI from 2005? IT: Welcome to Derry is a colossal misfire that squanders the chilling legacy of Stephen King's universe with laughably bad CGI and a glacial pace that tests even the most patient viewers. Obviously the show has just started, we're 3 episodes in, but it hasn't gotten any better episode 1 to 3. The CGI is the worst part.. It's so bad, looks cheap, old and perhaps from a cartoon more than a horror.",literal
"Tedious, over long - I hated it This is my first ever review on IMDB but as so many people keep asking me is this film as brilliant as Peter Bradshaw, critic, says.

In a word: no.

It's too try hard, uncomfortable and utterly tedious. I just willed it to end. JL is superb but an actor is only as good as the story she has to work with and work she does, hard and does a pretty good job. But she's bonkers and unhinged from the get go - a sort of immediate Betty Blue kind of crazy ; you have no time to like or bond with her and seeing RP in this made me realise he has yet to make a good film; this is certainly not one.

I truly hated it. As did my friends.

I respect the good reviews but can't agree with them.",literal
"Wrong Radio Cannot use 27.405 as a rescue frequency. This is a CB channel and has limited range so rescue would no be possible at the location where they are. Inland it maybe possible, but not that far out at sea. The boat should have been equipped with a HF marine radio. Any good boat captain would know this...",literal
"The American James Bond... ...is this movie in a nutshell. It has everything: Gadgets, Cars, Women, Guns, a doomsday device and a rich villain with many soldiers for our hero to kill.

But Xander Cage is no trained spy, but a extreme sports fanatic and also a rebel against authority, and Vin Diesel, which are three points that make him even better than our tuxedo-wearing friend...

The cinematography and editing is very good, mostly for the action sequences and (still) very impressive stunts.

Also the special and visual effects are top notch for a movie from 2002.

The style however is typical...typical Rob Cohen...typical early- 2000's EXTREME-nes. The music for example is pure early 2000's rock and hasn't aged that well, but the orchestral soundtrack is not that bad.

The story is interesting and never get's dull, so that it's entertaining all the way through.

It's a fun action movie, with a very entertaining lead and some incredibly impressive stunts...",literal
"Some of you missed the point SPOILERS AHEAD! Watch movie before reading.

Joe and Brian are foils for each other.

Both are seemingly emasculated by their respective love interest; have internalized conflict with their love interest's ex; both try to frame said exes because they are jealous and insecure. Brian and Joe want to be wanted, needed even, as men and dignitaries.

Both are radicalized through performative social justice posturing on the opposite sides of the pandemic: Brian- BLM/activism, Joe- Covid19 denier/police.

The ending is purely ironic; Brian gets everything that Joe had tried to get for himself: fame, fortune, family. Joe instead garners infamy for police brutality, is abandoned by his wife, and ultimately gets a life sentence of being jailed inside his paralyzed body, and despite actually becoming mayor on paper he is just a puppet for his conspiracy-theorist mother-in-law who becomes his conservator.

Besides all of that, the movie's subplot is about indigenous land rights being turned over to AI Data Centers under false pretenses. If the pandemic doesn't kill the people of Eddington now, this business deal will kill them later. And, at the end of the day, politicians are still politicians and are purely motivated by money- meaning, they have no idea what bills they are signing, they just know they're going to get paid and the people paying them will fund their campaign.

Also, a walking-talking Covid spore comes to town and not a single person quarantines him; he is the physical embodiment of the virus and everybody is too busy to consider that he is a herald of death.

Also, the acting, directing, cinematography were brilliant, as well as the writing itself. This movie is deeply unnerving, and it's visceral. Ari Aster and company once again do not waste a moment of screen time. This movie has layers between layers of nuance, symbolism, etc. One viewing may not be enough as there are lots of clues that if you blink you just might miss them.

TL;DR: White Male Inferiority Complex Heightened by the Pandemic and the Spotlight for Black Lives Matters Movement. Tech Bros and AI are Unconscionable- Preying on Isolated Communities Through False Advertisement and Political Gains. Great Movie.",figurative
"TMS As a big fan of Apple, I'm ashamed to say I've come relatively late to the party in terms of AppleTV+ and I'm really regretting that. Barring one underperforming title (Greyhound) the three shows I've watched have been varying degrees of spectacular. Mythic Quest? Great fun. Ted Lasso? Feel good winner of a comedy that I fell in love with. Now coming to The Morning Show and... Wow. MQ and Lasso bring a lot of fun but TMS is a slow burning show that knows how to hit the audience right in the feels, grab hold and not let go. By the time TMS hits its stride it is not only tremendously prescient, relevant television but it is gripping and heart-stopping. The characters are rich and developed, it's filmed beautifully, it twists and turns in ways that feel entirely earned and realistic and the ending (of season one) is just breathtaking.

I love a good slow show that takes its time building to where it wants to be, I do feel like TMS starts a little slower than I'd like, hence the not quite perfect rating, but this really is stunning once it hits its stride. I feel like, with TMS added to the growing list of great content, Apple TV+ is turning into this sleeping dragon of a streaming platform that sooner or later people are going to wake up to and realize how stunningly good it is.

All that said, this addresses the #MeToo movement and it doesn't pull punches so if you're worried about being triggered, be warned.",figurative
"It's actually funny If you're looking to switch off, have a couple of laughs then this is a great movie.

Lots of reviews slating itz this isn't an Oscar nomination. It's just a light hearted bit of fun.

Not sure what some people are expecting, giving it a 1/10. It's a solid 7. Would I watch it again? Probably not, but did I enjoy it? Absolutely.",literal
"What was that? The only things that episode 1 and the original story had in common was it was in Derry and there were kids involved. I'm not sure what a ""mutant baby"" had to do with the original story, but that was very disappointing. I will watch the next couple of episodes, to see if it gets better. Not sure what new storyline this is, concerning the ""it"" story.",figurative
"Genuinely outstanding Really blew my expectations out of the water. I did not expect to tear up at this movie, yet I did. It has its flaws, moments that feel repetitive, the action scenes feeling detached from the plot at times, but everything from the characters to the MUSIC, to the ANIMATION, incredible. This is up there for me with Into the Spider-Verse for animated movies. There's a cool meta-narrative and subversion of expectation if you came in because of the TWICE collaboration, which was such a fresh of breath air. That's something that can easily describe the rest of this movie, a beeath of fresh air. From concept to execution it's definitely crafted with love.",literal
"Anxiety Inducing I like Matthew Rhys, he did a fantastic job in The Americans which is why I decided to watch this.

It starts off really slow. The pace picks up a little bit in later episodes but the storyline is a bit erratic. New characters are introduced several episodes in, out of nowhere. There's not enough character development for the newly introduced ones.

The lead female actor is constantly nervous and huffing and puffing (not always with reason) and it's unsettling in a bad way, to the point of annoyance. Some scenes seem emotionally fake, like crying without tears.

Mostly there aren't really any likeable characters in this, nobody you can root for.

Matthew's acting is superb, as always but it's not enough to carry the show.

I find it disappointing and wouldn't recommend it.",literal
"A True Historical Drama Great characters, interesting story and well made tv series. Without Candice Millard and her extensive research and uncovering of colorful characters this show would not have had a chance. Mike Makowski has done a good job putting the series together and thankfully keeping to a bearable length (4 episodes).",literal
"A strong story with great performances that completely falls apart at the end. The trailer for Bugonia looked unique, the vibe was weird in a good way, and honestly, the second I saw Emma Stone and Jesse Plemons were in it, I was in. That alone sold me. I didn't know much else and didn't really need to.

Teddy (Jesse Plemons) is a guy who's gone way too far down the internet conspiracy hole. Not the funny meme side of it... the ""connects everything to everything"" side. The ""none of us can talk him out of this anymore"" side. And on top of that, he's also just not all there mentally. So when he decides that Michelle (Emma Stone), a powerful CEO, is secretly an alien trying to destroy Earth... he acts on it.

From there, the movie becomes a tense back-and-forth of is Teddy right, or is he completely gone?

The whole time, you're wondering how (or if) Michelle is going to escape.

It's suspenseful in a way that actually works.

And the acting? So good.

Jesse Plemons absolutely nails the ""calm but deeply broken"" thing.

Emma Stone plays Michelle with this perfect balance of control, fear, and ""don't mess with me.""

For most of the movie, I was totally locked in. Interested. Curious where it was going. The dialogue was sharp, the pacing was tight, and I really wanted to see how it would all play out.",figurative
"Terribly slow I can't quite wrap my head around all the positive comments for this film, they go so far that it is almost suspicious.

Anyway, me and my partner looked at each other after 1 hour and nodded to each other that it was time to leave. The storyline was going nowhere and it was frankly dull. I was really disappointed after reading some of the reviews for it, I'm not sure what I was expecting, but it wasn't that. It was so predictable that I could sit there and mouth the next line before they even said it, the cinematography was pretty average too, for me there wasn't much to like about it. Perhaps kids would enjoy it more? Sorry but I won't be watching P2.",literal
"Hopefully just the Warm-up I love everything about IT from the book to Pennyside to the movies, so yeah I was all in, and I was satisfied with this new introduction. But this was a little bit... ""inadequate"" and ""too much"" at the same time. Just a little bit.

My main problem is with the killings. The first character that we are introduced to gets killed instantly. Okay, the writers, directors and producers want this to look brutal and serious, get it. Or they just want to ""hook"" the viewer, idk. But the third, fourth and fifth ""main"" characters also get killed, all at the same time. Fom the first episode, 4 characters, who were intoduced as if they were main characters, get killed. 4 deaths in one episode. How many characters will there be in this series, if killings continue with this frequency? It will just be impossible to follow - unless, none of them were ""main"" characters, except for the two girls, and this was just a warm-up. Which still doesn't add anything to the story... My second issue is with the ""military"". Now, military and soldiers had incredibly minor references in the book. Why is military such a huge part of the series now? It feels completely disconnected. I felt like I was watching two totally seperate shows. I know the writers will patch the two stories together at one point and make it ""meaningful"", but it still doesn't deliver. Don't get me wrong, the military part has its own pace and moments for itself; but it felt ""unnecessary"".

Oh and the baby-demon looked awfully fake, sorry. Practical effects instead of digital ones would have done a lot better job.

Still, I'm happy and hyped to see Pennywise again.",literal
"Good start Quite good, unexpectedly good even. Comment coming from an original Poldark series fan (the second season of which I recently viewed again).

Considering the competition, the series start is very promising, hopefully they will keep it this way. Aidan Turner looks to be really on a par with Robin Ellis - which is astounding. A different approach but with essential nuances kept intact.

Goes without saying the scenery benefits from 40 ears distance and vastly superior technical possibilities (probably with a bigger budget also, relatively speaking), yet the atmosphere of the place the 1975 Poldark created can be immediately rediscovered.

The cast is alright, some pluses, some minuses for the corresponding characters in the Poldark of yore (I like a lot the new Prudie!).

Looking forward for the next episodes. The new Poldark might prove to be a hit and stand up along with the formidable old one in future's references. We'll be watching.",literal
"Wow... Im honestly surprised at such strong ratings for this first episode. I thought this was laughably bad to the point of being absurd. The kids did a great job acting but...yeah, as soon as that car scene went down I couldnt recover. From laughing.

Ive been a Stephen King fan since I discovered his books as a kid in the 80s, and from sneaking in to see Maximum Overdrive. But...yeah. More for everyone else!",literal
"Typical Apple TV pablum You simply can't get invested in the story because not one thing makes any sense, doesn't hold together, and is slap-dashed together. Also, acting is horrid (especially Ms. CIA), but we'll just blame that on director and script. So, with poor director, script, and acting ... I just can't wait for the next episode ... lol.",literal
"nahhh If you're expecting a block buster to wobble the original or even Prey think again- Predator: Badlands is a three star movie, I read the reviews and kinda hoped that the lower scores were just being hypercritical but they weren't far out.

Very Disneyfied, heroic underdog, side-kick and a cute anthropomorphic monster.

12A rating just in time for Xmas.",literal
"The Worst ""Horror"" Movie I've Seen My husband and I just watched this movie in theaters. I am an avid horror fan, and love all the different horror dynamics there are in cinema. However, this movie was absolutely terrible. You barely get to know the characters, the story is beyond boring, and it feels like it's trying to be too mind-bending. It's just overall bad. I wish we could have our time and money back.",literal
"This is not a NCIS show While this show has its merits, it seems to lack some qualities that have made the NCIS franchise so beloved among fans. The sense of belonging and the theme of found family, cherished in the NCIS series, are somewhat missing here, and the overall tone feels quite dark. Many viewers appreciate the lightheartedness of the original NCIS shows, so perhaps considering a revival of NCIS: Hawaii or New Orleans could be beneficial.

Additionally, exploring more profound character development might be helpful, as some characters feel less engaging than expected. There also appear to be some inconsistencies in the timeline and various plot points that could leave viewers puzzled.

On a side note, while pagers reflect an earlier time, it might be worth reconsidering how frequently they are featured in episodes. A balanced approach could enhance the viewing experience for a wider audience.",literal
"Excellent You cannot see this movie without thinking that what Trump is doing to the U. S. is exactly what Hitler and Himmler were trying to accomplish in Germany. Great supporting cast.

Excellent acting by the entire cast! Very sharp script and direction. Russel Crowe and Rami Malik were terrific..great view of post-war Germany.",literal
"So, so good. This show was great. Yes, it has its weak points... but, you genuinely care for the characters in the show the whole time. Edie Falco does an amazing job at making you believe she's willing to do just about anything to pick up. She constantly lies to her closest friends, family.. her daughters, who are the only thing she seems to actually care about for real, for brief periods. Aside from perhaps her job, which I think is what pulls you back time & time again - her ability to care and fight for her patients. So funny she doesn't put that effort into her own life. So many great filming techniques to tie themes/scenes together. Smart TV.

The characters are lovable, and remind you of people in your own life. The jokes are funny, the lows are lows. It really puts into perspective (in sometimes campy ways) what life with an addict can be.",literal
"Not a Classic, The Classic This is the quintessential coming of age moving for so many including myself. It was all baseball, all the time and this movie does that life justice more than any other. The epic odyssey worthy of Homer himself makes the movie that much more enjoyable even for the non-baseball crowd. This is a love story to the game of baseball, to Babe Ruth, and to fathers (and step-fathers) and sons who have bonded over the game for generations. This is one you can watch and enjoy again and again. No matter how many times they try to re-make it, there will never be anything like watching this movie for the first time, I wish I could go back and do it again. Meeting one of the guys in an airport one time made it that much more fun for me the next time around.",literal
"Finally Its out <3 Its been a very long wait for this show. I'm one of those Billy & Mandy, Invader Zim type people and this really hits the spot for me. Dark, Cynical, Witty. The animation is great. The story <3. The characters! Its dark, Fun & really exactly what I was hoping for. The color pallet is perfect for the setting.. Hell.. The adult humor is wonderful. I really have no bad to say about this cartoon. Its been long in the coming. I'm really grateful it came to fruition.",literal
A Disney animation for adults??? Yes I know this show hasn't made by Disney but as a Disney princess fan I must say It's like a Disney movie for adults (if Disney didn't lost its magic) The songs The meanings The art The story omg the story It's absolutely perfect But if you're a religious person you might find it kinda offensive but in my opinion it's not It's just a story with life lessons and for entertainment Unlike lots of adult animations it really has a great story I was a fan of this show since 4 years ago and I gotta say at first I was pissed about changing the cast and voice actor But then I watched the show and it was awesome After a really really long time we have an absolutely entertaining and enjoyible show to watch and it's just really awesome Thanks vivzie can't wait to see the rest I wish we can have more animation shows like this.,literal
"An Utter Slogfest I'm sure this movie resonates with plenty people out there but I found it tedious, dull and pretentious. It fails to get out of first gear, and although the acting is decent, neither Lawrence nor Pattinson seemed to be in the least bit challenged. The only reason I could figure for those two signing up for this was to work with each other. To label it a dark comedy is ridiculous. There were at best 2 chuckle moments in the entirety. I kept hanging on for something to pull me in and make me the least bit interested but it never materialized. The Joy Division cover for the end credits seemed well out of place and felt pretentious in the extreme. Not sure why anyone ever thought this would make a good movie. It's not.",literal
"Honestly didn't think this show would turn out this fantastic! When I first picked up on the series, I was busy as hell. I had 3 different projects I was working on and had to study for my upcoming exams the week after. Despite all that going on, this show always did manage to brighten my day. 

Now I know it may not look like it yet, but I believe that a show like One Punch Man deserves a spot in the hall of great TV shows alongside other giants in both real-life shows as well as anime and cartoons. I know I'm not the only one who thinks that the characters this show has are all undeniably and magnificently thought-out. Not to mention that their development is expertly and appropriately paced. The main character ""Saitama"" and his self-appointed student ""Genos"" including the rest of the supporting roles in the story are skillfully coordinated and the art style and animation go along so perfectly with the show's hilarious comedic elements.

I understand why about one person out of a hundred people wouldn't appreciate something like this. People have their own preferences, though I feel that most of the people that disregard One Punch Man and address it as synonymous as either Satan or watching those ten- hour long versions of music videos on Youtube are simply doing it out of spite for the mainstream or joining in the recently banded mini circle-jerk against a show that the majority of people find amazing and is clearly doing very well worldwide. There will always be that half a percent of negative Nancys I suppose.

I only wish I had more time to properly convey my thoughts of this show into the mind of the reader right now. Yes, I'm talking about you, random citizen!",literal
"As good as everyone says it is This show is as good as advertised. I've never heard of the books so I had no expectations going in so I'm pleasantly surprised by how much I like this. Zahn McClarnon has been good in just about everything he's ever been in but he's finally given a chance to be a lead and he excels at it. I could actually see him getting nominated for an Emmy for his work here, he's that good. Kiowa Gordon is an unknown actor who also does an excellent job and should have plenty of opportunities and a bright career after this. The rest of the cast (Noah Emmerich, Rainn Wilson, Jessica Matten, A Martinez, Jenna Elfman, etc) all hold their own here too. There are not many shows built around Native Americans so I'm glad this one didn't flame out and disappoint.",literal
"Why ""I didn't Want This"" Honestly, it's not worth the hype. I understand why everyone would be so excited about this show. Adam Brody, Kristen Bell, two adults falling in love and working their way up by being honest with each other as the plot, all of these elements would make a cute rom-com. (My sole reason to watch the show is Adam Brody.) But this one disappointed me. Here's why: This is a rom-com, so there should be comedy, but almost all the time, I felt like the humorous parts in the dialogues were put there for the sake of comedy, which didn't feel natural.

I don't know much about the Jewish culture in America, but still, I don't think their portrayal in the show was appropriate, even for the purpose of comedy.

The main tagline for the promotion of this show was ""two adults falling in love."" The Rabbi was more like a therapist than a spiritual leader. It's Joanne character that gave me the ""ick."" She's between 35 and 40, yet she behaves like she's in her early 20s. Here are some questions I have: * After all those years of dating, why was Noah reluctant to marry Rebecca?

* How did he like Joanne immediately and decide to go for her right away? Which character traits of Joanne interested him?

* In what particular way did Joanne parents being separated and her Dad being gay affect Joanne relationship skills?

* Most of the time, Noah is portrayed as an empathetic person who seemed to understand what Joanne was going through and ease her out of that. But most other times, he wasn't, like when he asked her about converting.

* So what was the point or the theme? Is it ""love conquers all"" or ""when a Jewish man loves a non-Jewish woman""? I am not sure.

Since Adam Brody and Kristen Bell got their niche characters respectively (maybe another actor to play Joanne would have been nice), Noah was more defined than Joanne. Joanne, as well as her sister Morag, lacked character depth, appearing too shallow to be clear about what they stand for in their podcast.

I am sure the show worked for the targeted audience, but I am a bit disappointed because I like both Brody and Bell from ""Kid Detective"" and ""The Good Place"" respectively. I expected a show that portrays relationships more in depth. And sadly, I didn't feel the chemistry between Noah and Joanne.

In conclusion, the script lacks authenticity due to shallow writing, predictable plot, and depthless characters. It could have been just a movie.",figurative
"Magic and Character development were lacking, but surprises entertained It is very important to realize that this movie must not be spoiled. I will not be discussing anything not shown in the trailers, and I ask you not to go looking for such secrets online, but only by watching it yourself. This movie is designed to entertain, and to a degree it does just that.

I haven't seen many of Leterrier's films, but I enjoyed this about as much as The Incredible Hulk, but more than Clash of the Titans. There were still disappointments. Magic movies have been a great interest of mine, and from the trailer I had to wonder, does Michael Caine + woman in a tank = The Prestige? Truthfully, the similarities stopped there, including magic's screen time.

Despite magic taking up most of the trailers, it was too scarce in the film itself. I wanted more magic. I know that doing so would take screen time from Ruffalo, but he wasn't the best of the bunch. In fact, they were Freeman, Caine, and Laurent, respectively.

The screen writing didn't allow for many to develop character well. The Four Horsemen were usually smooth-talking brick walls. And was that Dave Franco I saw? He had no screen time! (except for brief fancy dodging falling fighting)

These character holes would be acceptable if the movie were a large show. But as mentioned before, magic only came in smaller pieces, when at all. Some were amazing, some were old already, and some were hilarious.

It seems like I didn't appreciate the movie much, but I could only talk about what I didn't like. The rest, the secrets, I loved but can't talk about. Suffice it to say that many surprises are in store, and they're worth watching the movie for. That said, it's best to go in without guessing and predicting, because seeing the many reveals is where most of the entertainment lies. Don't spoil it for yourself.

This is a film some would be happier seeing in theatres, but if you don't think you'd spend ticket money for this, you'd probably regret it, so wait for DVD.

As a warning, there is a suggestive/inappropriate scene near the beginning that ends up going nowhere, but children's eyes should be turned aside. Also, there's a moment in a Mardi Gras parade that needs to be avoided, and minor language throughout. I'd recommend this movie for 17+, not only for these, but for the understanding of the secret material I can't bring up.",literal
"Suprise! It's Awsome! When it's right it's right. This adaptation is so freakin' right, and that has surprised me. I honestly didn't think I needed another telling of Robin Hood. Wrong. It's apparently just what I needed. I especially needed it told this way!

I'm loving it. Wanting more too.

The cast is great, production is top notch. They're not sugar coating or ""dumbing it down"" and it seems to be rubbing some viewers the wrong way... Wonder why? Season 2,3,4 please.",figurative
"One trick pony. I watched episode one and thought it clunky, so I took a break. Came back later, switched my brain off, and suddenly it worked , like sinking into a warm bath: pleasant, undemanding, and slightly tepid.

The premise? Entertaining enough. The execution? A one-trick pony. Russ is a bad man who redeems himself through the miracle of prosthetic makeup , because nothing says ""fresh start"" like a new face. Each episode plays a variation of ""Will his disguise fall off?"" , I got stung! I got soaked! I nearly used the communal shower! , rinse and repeat until absurdity looms. (""Oh no, my face melted over a candle!"" ""Help, a hamster's eaten it!"").

My only real gripe? It stops at episode six, just when a couple more might've tied things up properly. But I fear we're heading for a second series of ""Chad and My Face Nearly Slipped."" If only they'd resisted the American urge to flog the horse till it collapses. Ten solid episodes, story complete, applause all round , that's how you make something memorable.",figurative
"Satire at its finest Overall, the film was very interesting. It had great satire about the major outbreak of Covid in 2020. Not just bashing one side, but looking at the craziness happening on both side sides of the aisle. As with most a24 films was very thought-provoking and very satirical of the society surrounding the events it was covering.

The characters were great. Joaquin Phoenix is the stereotypical more conservative, leaning older person. Pedro Pascal plays a great slimy politician, who says one thing, but does another. The side characters in this film were great bringing a lot of variety and some funny moments to the film. I feel Austin Butler was under utilized.

The story was very satirical of the major outbreak of coronavirus in 2020. Initially, it started off very strong slowly becoming more and more tedious however, just as the TDM started to get annoying it goes from 0-60 in seconds. After some crazy events, it turns into an all out war with excitement around every corner.

In terms of production value, I didn't see anything that stood out. A24 is a great production company so their production value is always top-notch.",literal
"Prague set action thriller Easily the best of the XXX films. While desperately trying to be cooler than Bond, it ends up leaning more towards the preposterous end of the Brosnan films rather than the more gritty Craig series. Nicely shot, good locations (Prague and the vicinity), cool cars, some decent action. It's good, silly fun; the terrible, po-faced, heavy metal soundtrack being the worst thing about it.",literal

"Best movie i have watched the past year Finally i can write a good review! Me and my husband went to the cinema with no expectations, and oh man we we pleasently surprised. The storyline was perfect and the acting was amazing. A mixture of dark humor, thriller and the music...oh the music. Am a fan of the blues now! The music took me on a journey and was the best thing about the whole movie. Found myself going from dancing to having a jumpscare to laughing. It was a thrilling rollecoster! I honestly have nothing bad to say about this movie. A i would pay double to see a prequel actually. They delivered everything they wanted to deliver!",figurative

"This show is great Visual and environmental way and choice for telling the story, characters have good arcs, and fitting Fallout games, main characters and side characters, getting side-tracked and sidelined by side-quests. The Airship is here. Soundtrack is an absolute treat, mid-twentieth century songs, and tunes made for original score especially. The feel is here. The tone is here. Fallout style real world satire mixed with intrigue, unreliable narrators, and drama, with occasionally some real, really heavy stuff added below, or on top of it. All that and more with high budget and high production value..

Fallout is back, and Fallout is expanding.",literal
The Last Samurai meets Squid Game The games are all a ploy to get the few remaining samurai to kill each other. Rich folks bet on the results. Basically it's The Last Samurai smashed with Squid Game.

"""You cried during my movie and you gave it a 7/10?"" ""You cried during my movie and you gave it a 7/10?""

During a livestream reacting to rapper Joey Bada$$' 2022 '2000' album, the self-proclaimed ""internet's busiest music nerd"" Anthony Fantano cried during the song ""Survivor's Guilt"". In his review, Fantano gave the album a 7/10, to which Bada$$ said in a later interview with Fantano a more musically-inclined version of the aforementioned quote. To Fantano, moments of '2000' struck hard, yet the whole body of work did not reach the same highs as ""Survivor's Guilt"".

That is how I feel about ""The Long Walk"", an adaptation of Stephen King's first written (not first published) book of the same title. I won't sugarcoat it and I will admit that I cried at several points throughout the film. The movie does a great job at making you invested into the core four characters, causing the inevitable deaths of the losers sting. The bond between Pete and Ray was especially strong. There were many moments during their walk where one of them (usually Ray) was ready to give up, but the other would pick his friend up and rally the other on. The scene where Ray confesses to Pete what his wish would be if he won was a particular highlight showing the friends' bond, as well as the one early on in their trek where they are going up the steep hill late at night. The latter is probably my nomination for the best scene in the whole movie, largely because the number of deaths there was being the highest among any other moment during the walk. The cacophony caused by the sheer number of eliminations late at night added to the quality of the scene. The ending hit on mostly all cylinders and was when I cried the hardest due largely to who the movie chose as the finalists. You can probably imagine who the finalists are by who I've discussed the most in this review, but the results are different in the book, surprisingly enough. While I have my gripes with the results, which I'll get to in a second, I applaud the screenplay for revising the ending.

To go off that point, I think the dynamics resonate on a very deep level with the audience. The performances between Cooper Hoffman's ""Raymond"" and David Jonsson's ""Peter"" really penetrate your porcelain heart and make you a sappy guy: Or maybe that was just me, I don't know. Seeing the duo work through thick and thin to protect each other's backside reminds the audience of the good in humanity, even despite how down the world might try to keep us. The story is inherently of perseverance and of human heart, and the bond between the two leads is so infectious that you want to do better yourself after walking out the theater onto your own long walk to your car.

Regarding more technical aspects of the film, I liked how the conflict between rationality and irrationally is displayed. Many of the players believe they're acting rationally in how they sacrifice themselves, but in reality their decisions just lead to the game continuing unhindered. Late into the walk, one of the final five, who had previously been collected and self-isolating to prevent creating attachments, abruptly charged at one of the officers and killed the latter with his own rifle, resulting in the player's own demise. The player may have thought his decision was rational in ending the game for him and the other survivors, but he ultimately was reckless and got himself killed in the process. It's very Kafkaesque, if I do say so myself.

I did compare my thoughts of this movie to Anthony Fantano's review of '2000', so this review, naturally, will not be all sunshine and rainbows. For starters, the movie is left with a bunch of loose ends; for instance, Hank and Arthur's requests could never be fulfilled by the other two Musketeers. Hank's wife will never be supported by the winner because of how he reacts to seeing his friend get shot in the head, and Arthur's grandmother will never get his grandson's cross necklace because, well, she can't. Other important dialogue, like Ray's feet having to walk socks-only on his blistered feet, is brushed away and never addressed later. When all the boys meet at the starting point, Pete and Ray discuss how they might have trouble lasting because of their weight, yet they're the final two. Furthermore, some weighty scenes may have been more impactful if there was more pay-off. For most of the movie, Hank has his hand slouched inside his coat. I thought his hand was hit by a stray bullet during the first night; instead, he just had his hand positioned like that for no real reason. I thought his death could have been much more severe if he stuck out a mauled, gruesome hand as he bled out.

The dynamic between Pete and Ray really carries the movie. It's so good, in fact, that it saves a flawed movie. I feel like the emotion their relationship cultivates deceives the audience with how much is wrong with the film, thus why I feel like it has such a high score. I still think a lot is right with the film and I think the score is appropriate given the emotions it elicited from me.",figurative
"So cheesy. The only reason I gave it a 1 is because I couldn't give it a zero. Alicia Silverstone still brings the iconic Clueless vibes but the story and writing is so bad. I hate saying this because I couldn't do any better but come on people, if you're going to make a movie please try to make it somewhat believable.",literal
"Love it!!! Finally, something I love as good or even maybe more than Downton Abbey on Sunday night. It was so good - beautiful scenery, Aidan Turner is perfect for this part - good acting, good story line. It's got romance, drama, it's exciting, a man for the women to swoon over, beautiful English countryside, galloping horses; great costumes. It was just good and never, never boring or slow. It's got crazy English folks with bad teeth and it's just wild. I hope that it continues several years as I know I will be watching it. I've been so down and out since Downton went off in late Feb. I believe this show will definitely take the place of Downton, since it will be going off after the 6th season. Go Poldark!!",literal

"Francis Lawrence pares down King's dystopia but leaves little beneath the surface The dystopian young adult genre dominated the 2010s, but like most trends, it quickly burned out. Oversaturation left audiences weary after an endless barrage of near-identical stories. While a few franchises, most notably The Hunger Games with its recent spin-offs, have tried to keep the fire alive, viewers largely moved on. Francis Lawrence, who directed every Hunger Games installment except the first, is determined to prove the subgenre still has life, returning with a new adaptation of Stephen King's The Long Walk (2025).

Set in a bleak America, the story follows a group of teenage boys conscripted through a lottery into a brutal national event: the Long Walk. The rules are merciless. Keep pace or be executed by the armed escorts led by the Major (Mark Hamill). The prize is immense wealth; the price is certain death for everyone but one. Among the walkers are Raymond (Cooper Hoffman) and Peter (David Jonsson), who forge a fragile friendship as they march toward oblivion.

The premise inevitably recalls The Hunger Games: state-sanctioned violence against youth, broadcast as national entertainment. That resemblance isn't coincidental. King's novel, written in 1979, is often cited as a major influence on Suzanne Collins' bestselling series. Both works are meditations on the expendability of young men in unpopular wars-Vietnam in The Long Walk, Iraq in The Hunger Games-and on how televised images of conflict desensitize the public. Collins sharpened her critique through reality-TV satire, while Lawrence here strips King's story to its bare essentials: walk, endure, survive.

That pared-down focus is both strength and weakness. On one hand, the simplicity prevents the film from collapsing under self-importance, and its moments of tension-an untied shoe, a stumble that threatens to be fatal-are sharp and effective. On the other, the narrative offers little depth beyond its surface. Deaths become predictable, telegraphed by who gets dialogue and who doesn't, and stretches of the film sag under the weight of its own monotony. Lawrence stages the executions with blunt cruelty, wisely avoiding glamorization, but the repetition leaves the film dragging.

What rescues The Long Walk from mediocrity are its leads. Hoffman, son of the late Philip Seymour Hoffman-whose final screen work was under Lawrence's direction-delivers a performance of quiet charisma, making Raymond a believable everyman. Jonsson, meanwhile, builds on his eclectic résumé (Rye Lane (2023), Alien: Romulus (2024)) with a portrayal brimming with warmth and unforced optimism. He commands the screen with ease and suggests an actor ready for more demanding roles. Together, the pair lend the film an emotional center it would otherwise lack.

Ultimately, The Long Walk is a lean but limited entry in the dystopian YA canon. Its premise remains compelling, but Lawrence's refusal to probe beyond the basics leaves too many unanswered questions and too much dead air between jolts of tension. Still, the central friendship-brought vividly to life by Hoffman and Jonsson-provides enough heart to carry the film further than its thin script deserves.",literal
"Wow! Love it! It's cooler than NCIS! I've been a big fan of NCIS but NCIS Origins is fabulous! The casting is spot on. I love the retro time period (90's?) with the old tech like pagers, large monitors etc. I like how they intermix music in some of the scenes. There's humor and it's great seeing Leroy Gibbs as a member of the team, with Franks as his boss. You see camaraderie building with the other team members and why Gibbs did things with his team - the way he did. He learned from Franks! We get to learn how he came up with his ""rules"". I've been binging the series and hope there's many more seasons to come. It really is well done and exceeds the coolness of NCIS.",literal
"If Succession and Sons Of Anarchy had a baby Where i was when Yellowstone came out? It's 2025 and i just saw another masterpiece.

But come on! It was like a National Geography documentary, just beau-ti-ful! These breathtaking landscapes were just so magnificent and only that deserved more that all the 5 stars.

The storyline was brilliantly well written and perfectly played by all the actors.

But hats off for Kelly Reilly (Beth), she was THE badass of the show from the begin to the end she was perfect, woman and men at same time.

Luke Grimes (Kayce) was my second favorite, the calmest and the brute when his family was is danger, i found funny his hair was always changing during the seasons i found that ""cute"" (btw, he was the cutest haha, right after his kid) Brecken Merrill (Tate) he had grown so much between seasons, the same for Finn Little (Carter) he was so different that i though another was playing Carter.

But sad, for the end i was not expected Kevin Costner (John) to died, i almost thought that is was a trap for Wes Bentley (Jamie ) but unfortunately it was not, i saw later that it was Kevin leaving the show.

But in summary, it was a mix from Succession (family problems, legacy) and Sons of Anarchy (revenges, killing the other, protect the family) and then later, i understood why = Taylor Sheridan (Travis) was the creator of the show, and from other Spin Offs 1883 and 1923.

Another show to repeat.",figurative
"Really enjoyable, a nice break from the world I really hope this one lasts. The actors are good, and so is the writing. Of course, we're only into the 2nd episode, so it remains to be seen whether the premise can be maintained over time, but I think they have a good chance. This isn't high art, it's not going to change the landscape of television cop shows, but it will entertain you for an hour with good people trying to work together to solve crimes. There is a little push-back against having ""the cleaning lady"" help solve crimes, but egos get put aside for the greater good (at least so far). It's fun trying to pick up on the clues. The main character could be played a number of different ways that would be much less effective. Too upbeat, too tough, too ""trampy"", too arrogant,...She's just a single mom with a skill she didn't ask for, trying to do the best she can. She's just who she is, and doesn't apologize for it, but isn't pushy about it, either. She's kind but doesn't take any crap. As with a lot of these types of shows, she has a back story that motivates her to help the police. I'm so happy to see Judy Reyes again! She's great in this! I'm sorry if this is rambling -- long COVID-induced brain fog, among other things, so my writing and descriptive abilities have declined. I'm just enjoying this show so much that I felt I wanted to give it a shout out, hoping others may enjoy it, too!!",literal
Exceeded expectations! A wonderful adaptation of the classic that hits every emotion. Beautifully shot with stellar acting. Del Torro at his finest! By far one of the best movies I've seen in a long time and no doubt the star of TIFF this year. See it in theatres if you can to experience the artful score to get the full experience.,literal
"Silly and predictable, but funny It mayn't be one of my favourite Christmas movies, but it is one of the funnier ones for me. I agree some of it is silly, and when I say silly I mean silly, and the story is really quite predictable. But it at least looks good with some nice cinematography and scenery, and the music is fine too. The script has many funny moments and the sight gags while silly are respectable. The direction is competent and the performances from Chevy Chase and Beverley D'Angelo are likable while Randy Quaid gives some great relief as a decidedly obnoxious relative. So in conclusion, no masterpiece but it is entertaining, that's what matters to me. 8/10 Bethany Cox",figurative
"Don't be put off by negative reviews Counting myself as extremely fortunate to have worked as makeup artist on some amazing productions I do have a natural tendency to notice editing casting directing script etc and can be quite critical. This series I'm hooked I'm throughly enjoying i respect it may not be to everyone's taste but I really do have a lot of respect for every single effort that goes into this production.

For me personally I recommend it! If you're not sure just give it a go ;)

And don't compare it to peaky blinders it just sets up the audience to expect the same emotions it's can't be compared. I'm rooting for many more series :)",literal
"Used to be one of my favorite shows The first 8 seasons were great, totally 10/10. Very entertaining and real. However the last two seasons are downhill. Especially the last one. Boring and dull.",literal
"Psychological Overture Let me start by saying this is going to give you some serious deja vu to psychological thrillers like the SAW series and mind twisters like Kidnapped.

So the show starts out with a suspect being sentenced for the murder of FBI agent Emily Byrne(Stana Katic). Meanwhile you keep getting these flashes of her being tortured. So than the show fast forwards to six years later where her ex husband is remarried to her sister, and her son is living with them. Her husband gets a call telling him where to find her still alive! He of course rushes over to where the caller told him she would be and sure enough there she is, in a tub filled with water and a lock. From there the story just starts to build.

I have very rarely seen such a good performance as Stana gave in this role, it's hard enough to pull off being abused but she looks exactly how you would imagine someone would look if they were starved and tortured for 6 years. So far 10/10, supremely strong start, the acting, plot and atmosphere is right on point. And the support cast is doing a fantastic job so far.

Update: So I figured in season 1 they were done with all the twists and turns and in season 2 we could finally get on with some rebuilding, which is the nature of shows like this actually getting some light before going back dark. Nope, it just keeps getting darker and darker. And here's the problem, with a show that was already on the very edge of disturbing going even darker makes it worse, not better. Because now you're not actually rooting for anyone anymore. This is one of the things that the showrunners need to understand and they don't seem to, in the first season you have sympathy, in the second one you don't. So now it's just more of the same mind bending with no one really caring about happens. This show for me took a nose dive from a 10 to a 3 in the span of 1 season. Shame, it had potential and they squandered it.",literal
Why? Just so much no with this. Sarah Paulson isn't that great in anything anymore. Her face and the way she talks is so distracting. Kim needs to stop thinking she can do it all. She can't act. It's so beyond bad. The casting oterwide besides Sarah and Kim are good but this just feels like something that absolutely didn't need to be made.,literal
"Horrible & lazy I went in to the show with medium hopes and was so disappointed in what we got. First of all, The main villain scene on the plane was so stupid and not logical at all. From him breaking the locks, beating up all the marshals while blindfolded. Then don't even get me started on the fact that this guy put blood over his eye lids and pretended to have his eyes gouged out and be a marshal. So then they take him to the hospital and rewrap the bandage without seeing that its just his eyes closed? Plus the dialogue was bland and made no sense half of the time and mind you this is all in episode one. I was glad it did not seam to be woke but sometimes horrible writing is just as bad or even worse.",literal
"Season 16: This is how you reboot! Awesome! I always liked Criminals Minds a lot. But there were oh so many episodes where the plotlines or the character building was only so-so. I'd say it's normal to sometimes walk a slippery sloap when producing as many as 15 seasons of the same format. So, rebooting a series after 15 seasons is a bit of a challenge, to say the least.

But the 16th season is extraordinary well done!

First of all they changed the format. That is a dangerous thing to do: fans of the series might be very disappointed with the new way the plot is narrated. To me, it truely paid off. It was refreshing to have a ten episode build up following one case. And cleverly intertwined with some other cases that could be solved within one episode, like we we're used to in the old format.

The characters have much more depth to them then before. Remember (i forgot which season) they did an episode on Garcia's past, where she was the dark queen? It was so out of character! Or JJ in love with Spence, just messed up so many things. But the reboot corrected many of those storylines: focussing on JJ's marriage and the hardships a marriage has to endure. A grieving Rossi, Garcia battleling not to fall in love, Prentiss fighting politics and Lewis struggling with a difficult relationship: it gives depth to the characters we love. And one might forget Luke Alvez, his storyline wasn't as insightfull as the others, but first of all: his positive attitude and humerous side made him a very helpfull collegue and friend throughout this season and secondly: i wouldn't be surprised if this season was a setup for his uncovered feelings for Penolope Garcia. We'll have to wait for season 17. Also the main villain has a very strong character development. Love the fact that this psychopath does have a soft spot, even seems to genuinly care for his familiy.

The art direction shouldn't go unmentioned. Much more realistic then the previous format. It's like the BAU finally has some air to it. Instead of feeling like the set of a hollywood studio it felt like a real building. The same goes for all the other locations. Really well done.

And last but not least: the writing. Every promise that was made throughout the episodes was kept: the only date that Garcia and Alvez had, mentioned in the first episode, Rossi's grief over Kristall, Lewis' new troubling relationship, and many more breadcrumbs that we're layn out throughout the first episodes all had a dramatic function in the end. To me: that's good story telling!

Love, love, love to see season 17!",literal
"Better than the book This is an unusual case where it is better than the book it was based on. The books are SLOW, often going over unnecessary details not relevant to the story. All that is gone in the translation to visual media. The story is tight and while some details have changed, its to better fit with the format.

Production values are top notch and Gary Oldman is great as Jackson Lamb. I don't know where some folks got that this is some woke drama, but the gender and racial makeup is on par with the original source material, so that guy who wrote the review needs to put his big boy pants on and join the real world.",literal
"Silly but fun Yeh it might be silly and unrealistic but not everything needs to be realistic. People can't seem to have fun anymore and need everything to be gritty and like real life.

"This one's it. It's a medical drama, but it's got this real heart to it. Clearly, this is a show that is resonating with a wide audience, both traditional TV watchers and streaming fans alike. I'm sold after 3 episodes and hoping for a fast renewal. I can't remember when I was this excited about a Fox show. At its core, Doc feels more human, more relatable, and even a little quirky. It's got all the elements that make a medical drama addictive: emotional twists, complex characters, and just enough heart to make you pause and think.

People are really loving it. So if you're looking for a new binge-worthy show that's emotional, well-acted, and just overall solid, you've gotta check this one out.",literal
"Terrible I really wish I understood what the other people who gave this high marks.

The dialog has a very high school play feel - you say your line, then I'll say my line, then you say your line, very little emotion or natural timing

The attempts at having witty insults just landed flat most of the time. The movie really dragged on and for a horror movie there wasn't any horror. Practically no jump scares, or anything. It was just a really long drawn out terrible movie. It sucks because I was so looking forward to it, I enjoyed the first one.

I did like the attempt to tie it back to the mom and bring those elements together, but it was executed poorly. This was just a really bad movie. And the bar for me is rather low, I'm fairly easily entertained.",literal
Disappo At least the actors will be able to pay their rent this month. Weak storyline. Kevin James is simply recreating his Doug Hefferman role which would have been ok had the story been better. I can't see kids or adults liking this film. I only wrote this much because of the amount of characters required.,literal
"typical 'meh' British crime drama Interesting start but side character cheese was foul and took away from the main plot. So much cringe dialogue I almost gave up and perhaps should have, a 6 is generous... I really wanted this to be better.",literal
"Gritty and Compelling Ensemble Drama That Works This intense drama, now in its 15th season and still going strong, set the stage for ensemble drama, in which the cast plays a secondary role to the story. Law & Order, as originally conceived, drew the viewer into the process by which American law enforcement and litigation works, or doesn't, depending on the viewer's opinion. The first half-hour is devoted to the investigation of a crime, the second to its prosecution. Cases are made or lost by evidence, lack thereof, a technicality, or even judicial whim. Dick Wolf made it clear from day one that the cast was expendable; no prima donnas here. The first cast was all male, with one African-American. Wolf apparently caved to fan pressure for a more politically-correct spectrum, but it really didn't matter so long as the actors could carry the story forward. His best casting choice was Jerry Orbach, his worst Elisabeth Rohm, but with or without these people, the drama continues. In recent years, L&O has lost some of the grittiness that made it so compelling, and I do miss actors such as Steven Hill, Michael Moriarty, Chris Noth, Jill Hennessy and now Orbach, but the show is still far superior to the majority of what passes for prime-time programming. It only suffers in the rare episodes when a politically-correct message is pushed into the story, i.e., whenever it deviates from its original format of presenting how the criminal justice system works. Ignore the spinoffs; the original Law & Order is still the best.",literal
"Intriguing mystery with a lot of layers So I have AMC+ and have seen the first 2 episodes and it just gets better and better. It's part mystery, thriller, dark humor, and drama- a bit of everything with wonderful acting. I absolutely love Zach McClarnon in everything I've seen him in, the series Fargo, Reservation Dogs, Westword, can't recall what else, but the guy has range and I can't wait for him to have an Academy type role, he is due.

Noah Emmerich from the Americans plays a self-important FBI agent, Rainn Wilson plays a used car salesman and another sleezy part in the story I'm sure, lol. Every character is interesting.

This 6 part series is executive produced by George RR Martin and Robert Redford, so you know it's gonna be a great story. I can't wait to see where it goes!",literal
"A breath of fresh air in the world of animation To viewers who are not familiar with the twisted minds of creators Zach Hadel and Michael Cusack, Smiling Friends might be off-putting and much too ""in your face"" and grotesque at first. But to anyone who is willing to keep an open mind and/or is a connoisseur of absurd comedy, this show is a true gem.

In just 8 short, 11 minute episodes the team behind Smiling Friends managed to prove that you do not need to follow trends and industry standard formulae to create something entertaining and worthwhile.

You will not find your typical burned-out, substance abusing anti-heroes here, no protagonists who have to deal with complex issues stemming from some sort of childhood trauma, no dysfunctional yet loving families, no teens with daddy issues, no pretentious political commentary, none of the clichés you have been convinced is ""top-notch storytelling"" in the past 10 years.

Instead you have a wonderful cast of colorful characters, brought to life by an immensely talented cast of voice actors and animators, juxtaposed with a realistic, yet simultaneously bizarre and fantastical world.

These 'critters' are hell-bent on making you smile, and if you're willing to give them a chance, let your guard down, sit down and forget about the harsh realities of our own world for just 11 minutes, I can guarantee you that they will succeed.",figurative
"Wow. There are a lot of reviews already for this movie, so it is unlikely anyone will read mine. But I feel like I have to weigh in on this movie.

This is the most fun I've had watching a flick in a very, very long time. This movie is a riot! It isn't quite as clever as it thinks it is. Most of the surprises weren't terribly surprising; off the top of my head I can identify at least three that I saw coming. But I don't care.

It was fun! It was funny and engaging and I found myself simultaneously rooting for both sides. There is no shortage of action, the dialogue is peppy, and - unlike almost everything else I've watched lately - it's never boring.

Do yourself a favor and don't analyze. Just sit back and enjoy the ride. Movies don't have to be life-altering.",literal
"Nice adaptation I laughed out loud on many occasions at the original British version, which is wilder on many subjects, but i admit that this one is quite good.

It started like a poor Copy-Paste with no soul of its own, watchable for those who didn't know better. Even so, it was nice. Watch the original ""about last night"" SO2 Ep 2 if you need to watch one? WATCH THIS ONE !

It took a different direction somewhere with American characters as ghosts and an Indian rooted chef who is a benevolent husband, right away. That's the spirit of this comedy

I will always cherish the original, may even clock a 9/10 on that one. But the adaptation is nice enough. It's way better than ""the office"" for morale. Kindof eclipsed by Severance (Sci-fi). There is that.

As ghosts go it's as Walt Disney as can be, with a few quirks. They want to be ""sucked off"" to heaven. Finish some unfinished business.",literal
"Dt Great show with dragons, sex, fighting, dwarfs and cooking tips",literal
"second season cringy as hell The writers putting lines like ""Wednesday core"" ""freedom and joy era"" ""thats right i am your bruh"" is making this show feel so cringy... this could've moved forward without the overuse of 2020 slang. The story is also taking a boring lane and theres pretty much nothing interesting about this anymore except Jenna's acting.",literal
"Great Show, I give it a 50k out of 10 Jokes aside though this show really is just incredible and it's so amazing that an indie YouTube pilot could become a full studio produced show on Amazon prime like this! The first episode is rough with a lot of unnecessary swear words and rushed pacing but after that the quality sky rockets, the musical numbers are all fantastic I have almost all of them added to my Spotify playlist, the characters are all likeable and the emotional beats in episode 4 hit really hard, the character designs and backgrounds of this show are all stunning, it's honestly just pure eye candy and I can't wait for the rest of season 1 and season 2 to come out, this is a show I highly recommmed!",literal
"Glorious anarchy!! This review is based on the first 3 seasons.

Very good and exciting series!!

I adapted very quickly to this family as a big fan of crime series.

All the actors are just reeealllyy greeeeat but i have to single out Smurf, the actress Ellen Barkin...she was just born for this character, absolutely fantastic! The photography also stands out...especially in the exciting moments of action they are just perfect, like for example the scenes in parachute, motorbikes, surfing... etc. Just awesome!

The music is also very good!!!

The story of this wonderful family... hahaha... well, I like them... :)... it's very well told and edited, each episode is exciting and unexpected, it doesn't let you breathe at times nor does it let you press the stop button . Of course, and like every long series with many seasons, there are moments that are less good and somewhat repetitive. The sex scenes could be less for example, as well as the continuous use of drugs, especially at the beginning of the series. I must also emphasize the homosexual sex, something that is not usually seen in American series, Thumbs up!👍

I recommend it simply for the quality, the music, the photography, the tension, .., the strong emotions ...but if you don't like crime and rockandrolllll..strong emotions, choose something else.",literal
"Great idea, Seehorn misses the mark Interesting exploration of perfection and happiness that is a bit of sci-fi alien invasion with a twist of making the world a better place. It brings up existential issues of what life means and how life has meaning, and taps into the whole social media sense that everybody knows your business. That's the good part, but it's hard to see where this goes beyond a few episodes and maybe even ten, but the biggest drawback is Rhea Seehorn who boarders on annoying with her locked in anger which gives her character no depth. Her performance drags everything down. Even scenes before the invasion she is just negative energy and while that's the intent, there is no nuance and assessment of the very issues the show brings up, just perpetual anger which makes her more unlikable and not the kind of person you'd want to hang out with, which means the ""comedy?"" rings hollow. Extra point for the concept.",figurative
"Dark Winds Murder and Secrets My Curiosity Is Piqued Dark Winds is in a perfect spot with AMC, which continues to show content that people once went to the movies to see. I think Actor Zahn McClarnon is one actor who always knows how to play it cool but wise. McClarnon and the rest of the ensemble are a great match-up. The showrunners (so far) are doing a great job getting me to connect with the characters through their stories. It feels like it's going to be a great series, and my curiosity is piqued, I honestly can't wait to see what happens next.

As always, if you made it this far, thanks for reading, and if you watch this series, let me know what you think.

Keep it interesting, Stay Channel Surfing!

"One of the best, if not, THE best show of all time Being able to finish the entire show in a week and a half is a testament to how tightly written, engaging and easily binge-able it is. Some of the most fascinating character studies you'll ever see. You can't help but get invested in the different characters' journeys and the overarching story. The storytelling is impeccable and the dialogue between characters is dynamic and engaging. At times, very intense and other times funny. The acting is some of the best you'll ever see. There's a reason why so many of the actors either won or were nominated for awards. The cinematography is poetic. An iconic and unforgettable show. Breaking Bad is without a doubt one of the best, if not, the best show of all time. An unstoppable, immovable force of cinema that demands to be watched, and maybe even re watched. If you've never watched Breaking Bad, do yourself a favor. Climb out from under the rock you've been living under and give this show a watch. Believe me, you won't regret it.

There's moments in this show that are truly unforgettable, that stick with you forever. The way they create tension and build up certain scenes is incredible. A lot of very clever and brilliant ideas were thought of for this show. From the cinematography, the plot development, the character development, the editing, the soundtrack/songs, sound design, the titles of the episodes, the use of color, metaphors and symbolism. It's all beautifully and masterfully done. The show also covers psychological problems that men and women face. Focusing more on the psychological troubles that Walt, Jesse and Hank have to deal with. It's interesting seeing how they overcome their problems. The show also highlights the problems that can arise if men don't have their ego and pride in check.

It's amazing the way the plot progresses, the different events that happen throughout that change everything, the characters and the way they develop. It's interesting because they take a simple approach to writing the show. They don't make things complex or convoluted or ambiguous. But they also don't hold the viewer by the hand or treat them like a monkey. It's this beautiful approach to writing that makes this show one of the best. The characters are beautifully written and fleshed out. They're given so much depth and personality that you can't help but become invested in them. One of the best parts of the show is seeing how all the different characters interact with one another and how their paths interconnect with one another. It's a masterful character-driven story with depth. It's brilliant how they also do social commentary on American health care, the fast food industry, the drug industry (including the Cartel) and the legal system.

Although it can be a quite dark, gritty and violent show at times, it never gets overly bleak and always manages to lighten things up with some humor. This is one of my favorite qualities if a movie or show can pull it off. They get really creative with some of the camera work and cinematography. It's pretty terrifying how quickly his personality can change in the blink of an eye. One minute he'll be passive and calm then the next he's intimidating, confrontational and intense. His split personality is both fascinating, gripping and scary to experience. It's kind of like Dr. Jeckyl and Mr. Hyde. He ego trips like crazy and his pride is out of control. He's a manipulative pathological liar and isn't scared to make people feel inferior or bad. It was always fascinating to see when Heisenberg would come out and when Walter would just be family Walter. It's this spontaneous side of him that was always so refreshing to watch. It's crazy seeing how many people's lives he affected (and not in a good way). All the lives he destroyed or changed including his families, friends and everyone around him. Every single person that dies was a result of Walt and his actions, his choices. I mean, talk about a man becoming a monster.

Jesse is such a beautifully written character. He's definitely one of my favorites. I feel for the guy. He's put through so much at the hands of Walt and yet has a kind heart. He's also everyone's punching bag. Everyone takes out their insecurities, their frustrations, their problems on Jesse and he just has to deal with it. Such a tortured soul, and it's so sad because his parents cared so much about him. Hank was another incredibly written character. Seeing his transformation and character arc was fascinating. Hank's flaw was that he dug too deep and his was too persistent, relentless, determined and obsessed with seeking justice. He was willing to do whatever it takes to catch Heisenberg. Such a beautifully flawed and human character. And what an amazing performance from Dean Norris as well. Skyler starts out as my least favorite and most disliked character in the show, but then eventually she turns around. Mike is another character I really liked as well. Gus, Saul and even Tuco all amazing characters as well. Even Tio!",literal
"Out of sequence I watched The Predator: Badlands last night with my wife in the cinema, and honestly, apart from the popcorn and Pepsi, the experience felt like a complete waste of time. Ever since the original 1987 Predator, the franchise has carried a very distinct mindset: the Predator species is portrayed as a highly advanced, ruthless, precise, and almost ritualistic race of hunters-alien killing machines who hunt for sport and pride. That concept created an aura of fear, mystery, and respect around the Predators.

Unfortunately, Badlands seems to abandon much of that legacy. For the first time since 1987, the ""hunter becomes the hunted,"" but instead of offering a fresh, intelligent twist on that idea, the movie treats it as a gimmick. The Predators-once seen as supreme hunters-come off as surprisingly vulnerable and poorly utilized. The film dilutes the thrill and tension that defined the franchise, replacing it with messy action sequences and weak character development. Even the world-building felt shallow, offering nothing memorable or new to add to Predator lore.

In the end, the movie fails to honour what made the Predator iconic in the first place, leaving longtime fans disappointed and wishing they had spent their evening differently.",literal
"excellent but ruined by the end I would have scored it with a 10 if the end had not treated the best characters so disrespectfully. It was devastating to see a forced end, steamed, and also did not honor the great previous development of the characters",literal
"SOMEBODY CALL AN EXORCIST This show is as charming as a wet sock.

I was really looking forward to this! It IS SOOO nice to not have another cop/detective/firefighter show!!! Totally admit, we need variety. I love the main actress (Rose) and love the British version. However, N America cannot seem to grasp what makes a Britcom work. Nuance!

From the introduction, I hated the warm tones of the lighting. Then, they introduce the couple and, I must agree, they lack any chemistry or believability. They come off like they're doing a stage play with their cheery, chirpy over exaggerated acting. Next, we get to meet the ghosts. I love the assortment! Totally hate the portrayal!! I get it, it's 2021. One example: the show would be lambasted if the Native American was a throwback to the 60s western or F Troop (look it up).

It takes talent to create a stereotype and not be stereotypical (offensive). It's a talent the writers are completely missing. Admittedly, it's a VERY thin line to walk but it can be done.

The rests of the ghosts are no better. They took what was great about the UK ghosts, threw them in a blender, and created some American ""meh"" version. All the ghosts talk and act like they're in 2021, but the writers also play with the 'fish out of water(time)' ignorance aspect. If ghosts evolve, let them evolve. Picking and choosing when a character knows something or doesn't is poorly written.

It's a challenge to create characters from different periods that are funny AND aren't offensive. It can be done! America is SUCH a melting pot of culture and changes with each time period. They, the ghosts, could have had a well of character to draw their humor. That said, why not let the main actress use her real accent. America=melting pot=diversity.

This feels like it would have made a better Summer filler than a Fall premiere. I'll be surprised if this gets a second season. Also, go watch the British version. This version is community theater and is WAY overwritten. It could have been so much more saying/doing so much less.",literal
"First ten minutes of the first show sucks!! Kim is the show runner here? I think not. Why are there so many cuss words to start off with? I don't see a second season coming up.

Sick and tired of all the premier get together's and stating that they are eating ""see you next Tuesday for dinner?? Wow smh. I'm going back to watch 911 which has better storylines and way better actors.",literal
"Nice action but too many things that don't make sense So I'm late to the party - still in season 1, and overall I like the show and most of the characters except the guy Jubal who does nothing that I can see except say ""yeah, yeah, yeah"" over and over. Some of the things these agents do don't really make much sense, like chasing a guy with a ricin sprayer, who wears a respirator, but nary an agent appears to own one. Guess their budget didn't allow them to protect themselves! Then there was the one where the third chief lady, in episode 7 (why was there a revolving door in that role???) is with a 12 year old boy who had just been blown up, and she presses her finger to his neck WITH LEATHER GLOVES ON to check his pulse, announcing ""he's alive!"" - come on! I'll give them another episode to see if this stupidity continues.",literal
"Jeremy Renner! I commenced watching this show in anticipation of Yellowstone's season 5 conclusion, aware of Taylor Sheridan's involvement, which guaranteed exceptional storytelling. Jeremy Renner's compelling performance from the first episode enthralled me. Kyle Chandler's abrupt departure was disconcerting, but Renner's skill maintained my investment. The series excels with its relentless drama, dark atmosphere, and intense action. Renner's commitment to his role, even after a life-threatening incident, is admirable. I wholeheartedly recommend this show and eagerly await future seasons, hoping for Renner's continued involvement. I'd give it 1 million stars if I could.",literal
"Who else did not like Rory? I remember watching the first episode and thinking, ""wow, this is painfully below average."" I don't know why I stuck with it, I think it was Lorelei, she was so charismatic, beautiful and funny-

The show becomes repetitive after a point, I ended up watching all nine seasons of HIMYM and five seasons of Breaking bad, after watching three seasons of GG.

In the starting I liked Rory but after she goes to college and royally ruins everything for herself, my dislike for her overpowers anything good about the show. I watched the show only for my forever ship: Luke and Lorelei, it was not worth it. I even watched the 'A year in life' for them, once again not worth it.

Would I recommend it? First four seasons yeah, maybe if you're desperate to watch something where every episode ends on a good note.

The only episode I liked was the one where Lorelei calls Luke, he doesn't pick up and she leaves a message referencing 'The Way We We're,' now make what you will-",literal
"It is not a documentary, it is a fictional story, and a good one! Production is great, dialogues a bit over the top sometimes but still very good, acting is unbelievable good with lots of emotional moments being played to perfection. If you expect the accuracy of a documentary you won't get it. If you want quality entertainment, you've come to the right place.

If you worry about the soundtrack, don't. They did add bits and pieces of modern music but most of it it is the jolly Irish tune.",literal

"eXXXtreme 90s Wouldn't be the first XXX movie I've seen, but it is for this series.

I may never have seen a single entry in this series if not for the How Did This Get Made? podcast. They recently covered part 3x3, so I figured I'd begin at the intro.

Was this a bad movie? By all means, no. Just, it was tooDAMNLONG. Yes, it came out in 2002 but it was sooo 1990s. If you like this sort of no- brainer, Bond-rip-off sort of action flick – like I do, then this is the movie for you.

Not a cliché passes as our ""anti-hero"" Xander Cage is recruited to take down the stereotypical end-times terrorists. Along the way, he's tested several times to pad the movie's running time and prove he's got the heart to save the good guys and preserve mankind.

Already stated, it's worth seeing if you love the blow'em up 90s action films. I just wish it wasn't so long. I haven't seen the follow-ups yet and will, thanks HDTGM, but hopefully they're merciful with the screen- time.

Final thoughts: Why wasn't this a spin off of the Fast/Furious series? It was practically the same character for Vin Diesel. It's not like he's pitching black for this audience.",figurative
"All the doctors sleep with each other and then die I stopped watching after season 15. But, I came back several years later to resume the bingefest of this dumpster fire of a show.

Before writing this review I noticed I had rated this show a 9. A 9! That's just not true and I was clearly delulu, so I brought it down to a reasonably accurate 6.

So what went wrong? It's predictable, boring and really, really impractical and delusional. The body count (sexual) of these doctors is insane and there are no boundaries, sisters sleeping with the same guy, a neurosurgeon just casually looking for a threesome with the local lesbian OB, and so on. (No Meredith, it's not ok just because it's been a few years and Maggie doesn't mind).

What's worse is Shonda's body count (fatal). She has killed more doctors than that Game of Thrones guy. We've seen storms, shooters, plane crashes, explosions (multiple) and of course, the pandemic.

The seasons 1-9 are brilliant. The plot points still feel interesting, unique, involved. Yes, some favorites die but it's still bearable.

10-14 it starts to dip. You start seeing the patterns and it gets predictable. But there's still some feel to it, so you can give it a go, but I won't blame you if you decide to make this your stop.

Seasons 15 onwards is where everything goes up in flames. The best couples who had the most undying love break up, the deaths don't even matter anymore. I knew what was going to happen Every. Single. Time and it was just boring. What's worse is the preaching. Race, religion, politics need to just stay out of fictional TV dramas. Don't tell me about oppression when you can't keep your pants on for a few hours in the hospital!

Overall, I would still recommend the show, it's just gone from great TV that you can bingewatch to a piece of flaming hot garbage that you can still bingewatch because it's just so bad, that it's good. I just can't wait to see how it ends, or will it? *dramatic illuminati music*",figurative
"Sean Penn- Take a bow Loved the film as a whole but was completely captivated by Sean Penn's character and performance. Wow gave me reminders of Christoph Waltz in Inglorious Basterds.

Di Caprio is very good too, as is Benicio del Toro. Teyana Taylor I wouldn't mess with especially when pregnant!!

Overall I really enjoyed the twists meandering around the plot. Tarentino feels.

Good film.",literal
"Long time laughter! I started watching the series just because it was newly released, but then I got completely hooked! It's been a while since I watched a light-hearted satirical comedy, so this show was a breath of fresh air for me. The humor is sharp yet relatable, and it cleverly pokes fun at the quirks and challenges of working in a medical environment without ever feeling mean-spirited.

What really stands out is the writing-it's witty, fast-paced, and packed with clever one-liners that keep you laughing throughout. The characters are well-developed, each with their own unique quirks and personalities that make them feel authentic and endearing. I didn't know anything about the cast before watching, but they've absolutely won me over with their impeccable comedic timing and chemistry. The ensemble works so well together, and it's clear they're having a blast bringing these characters to life.

If you're a fan of medical dramas but wish they had more laughs, or if you just enjoy well-written sitcoms with a great cast, this is definitely the show for you.",figurative
Wow Another great show by amazon. I just started my amazon prime subscription and have decided that the shows are too good to stop the subscription so a watching I will do keep making show like these and you will have me for life.,literal
"Second Time Has Some Fun Charm LIKES: The Pace The Comedy The Charisma The Music The Sound Editing The Action The Silliness Is Still There Some Development The Visual Style Overall Just Fun Summary: A sequel has a lot to try to live up to, and Nobody 2 accomplishes some characteristics quite well with their approach. The pace is somewhat the same as the first, focusing a bit more on the fun than the first film. It's a comedy-centric film, the darker humor once more well-timed, presented, and crammed into every facet as Hutch faces yet another conspiracy hiding under his nose. I laughed a lot with the one-liners and the temper jokes, enjoying the slightly demented slice of life into an action scene that somehow feels a perfect poke against the one-man army genre. Nobody 2 maintains the charisma of the film, somehow keeping the wacky action, laughs, and depth decently present as we just go on a family vacation. It's a nice blend, still holding that entertainment factor, with performances that still feel just as raw and well-executed as I expected in the film. Character development isn't too bad, a nice little mini-dive into a new facet of our traumatized hero, this time bringing a new weakness into the mix to try and overcome to give Nobody's saga a little more dimension. Fortunately, it doesn't get in the way of the action, still blowing a gaping hole into the franchise with that stylish choreography that brings a video game's variety and edge to the big screen. Plenty of hand-to-hand combat and gunplay will light up the screen, and though there is some carnage and gore, Tiahianto's crew still manages to garnish it up to be manageable for all but the most squeamish stomach. Finally, the visual and audio elements come together to help add some theater-worthy elements to the film. The sound is very loud in this film, but it pulls you into all the chaos and does not apologize for all the explosive sound effects that they have in their arsenal. Nobody 2 also brings wicked visuals (as mentioned before) with a comical sheen to the action, and plenty of exciting sequences that bring our collector's assassin skills to new levels of chaos that seem to parody Wick's darker and more intense moves. Add in a killer soundtrack to mix things up, once again adding some flair to the moments, and Nobody 2 has once again proven to be a unique entry into this genre. If I had to summarize the likes in one sentence, it's that the film is just fun, another escape from reality that some movies fail to accomplish.

DISLIKES: Needs More Story More RZA A Little More Comedy Balance Better Villain Not Quite As Balanced More Christopher Lloyd Summary: Being the picky reviewer, the second movie still needed some more build-up to match what I loved in the first film so well. For one thing, I wanted a story again. I'll admit that the first movie's tale wasn't the biggest, mind-blowing piece to grace the theaters, but it had a little more logic, build, and development. Hutch's second journey focuses much more on the spectacle, leaving some of the storylines dangling with limited investment, exploration, or even purpose when they were cut so short. This is true for two of my other favorite characters, RZA and Lloyd's characters, who had a lot more punch in the first movie when Hutch gets pulled back into his career. We get a few snippets and some cool moments that push them into their inclusion, but I saw so much more potential with the characters than just shoving them into the background. Character utilization is quite less impressive for me, and I had hoped we could have had just that same integration in the past to help uncover this mystery. Sadly, the comedy antics and over-the-top action become the obsession, and that's where the film needs to tone it back to strike that balance I liked so much more in the first installment. In addition, a better villain could have saved the day as well. Our newest villain feels in line with the new direction, but outside of an aggressively foul mouth, some wicked style, and exaggerated dancing worthy of a new TikTok dance craze...she kind of is a laughable villain who did little but bring some great lines to the movie, I found to be the most clever. There is plenty of enjoyment in the film, don't get me wrong on that, but again, there is some balance, time expansion, and a little more planning needed to help rein in the ridiculous meter in a bit.

The VERDICT: I had a lot of fun with the second movie and found this film to be exactly what the trailers promised it would be: a movie theater blast. It's all about the pizazz of the series, bringing over-the-top fights and comedy that will appeal to those with a sense of humor geared to darker themes. It moves fast, keeps the laughs up, and keeps the temper-driven antics in full throttle, yet keeps the violence and tone light enough with the satire to help buffer things. With great visuals and audio support and plenty of moments to laugh at, the sequel accomplishes much for being that fun night out to kill some time and break free from the stresses of the world. However, the movie is a step down from the first film, still shying away from the balance with characters, story, action, and comedy out of sync that I think needed a little more planning. While I never expected this to be the Oscar-worthy story or movie, I had hoped for the same level of development the first held, and that's not quite there. Thus, go there knowing you are going to be exposed to just an overly silly cinematic piece that is just fun and stupid to watch. Worth the theater visit? I think so, mainly for the fun and visual/audio aid. My scores are: Action/Comedy/Crime/Thriller: 7.5 Movie Overall: 6.5-7.0.",figurative
"Where's The Tylenol? National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation not only stands as one of the best Christmas movie staples around the holiday season, it's one of my all-time favorite movies. This is the third entry in the National Lampoon's Vacation franchise, and it follows the Griswold family setting up their house for the arrival of their relatives. Along the way, Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) encounters a few situations that hilariously go wrong. The comedy is inventively funny, as it takes some of the recurring jokes in the Vacation movies and refreshes them for the holiday theme. The acting talent is brilliant. Chevy Chase, Beverly D'Angelo, Randy Quaid, and Miriam Flynn all reprise their roles from the previous Vacation movies, Cape Fear's Juliette Lewis and The Big Bang Theory's Johnny Galecki step into the roles of Audrey and Rusty this time around, and there are supporting performances from Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Brian Doyle-Murray, Doris Roberts, and Mae Questel. Each performer does great in their roles, especially Randy Quaid as Cousin Eddie, who steals most of the scenes. And the writing is incredible, as it balances out the comedy with moments of Clark trying to realize the true meaning of Christmas. Christmas Vacation is one of 5 sequels in the National Lampoon's Vacation franchise, and it's easily the best one. It may not eclipse the first Vacation movie, but with its holiday theme, it stands on its own. It's a timeless classic that continues to hold up today, and it has managed to stand as one of the best Christmas movies, as well as one of the funniest movies of all-time.

Score: 99/100

Recommendation: The highest of recommendations",literal
"LOVE this show! Just binged seasons 1 through 5 and I can't wait for season 6 and new episodes!

I love it so much that I might just start over from season 1 and binge it again.

I love all the characters, that has never happened to me before, liking every character on a show. But with this show I do. Lucy and Tim are definite favorites (I have a little -major- crush on officer Bradford), but all the others are very likable too. Nolan, Lopez, Harper, Grey, Wesley, just everyone is likable. I like all the action, the friendships, the love stories.

I think the show is pretty realistic too. Obviously I'm not sure because I'm not a cop but it feels (mostly) really realistic.

Truly love this show!",literal
"The white death I'm not sure but i believe this film is loosely based on the Finnish sniper Simo Hayha, ""the white death"". Or at least the protagonists back story.

I'll keep it short and sweet. If you like rough action and satisfying villain deaths, watch it. It's grimm and hard. There is not a whole lot of dialogue in the movie. I think it's not until the very end of the movie that the hero speaks. It's well filmed with beautiful shots at times and the score fits well.

That being said, it's at the end where it all goes off the rails for me. There is some stuff that happens with an airplane which is just ridiculous. It's a bit of a shame because it was not necessary for me for the movie to have such a fast and furious style end sequence.

I enjoyed it but yeah... that end bit just didn't do it for me.",literal
"Amazing, riveting, incredible,mysterious, best show for years Severance is incredible, yes it's a slow burn from episode one but each episode keeps you enthralled with the excellent characters and tidbits of reveals thru to the season finale, never have I been so gripped to the edge of my seat with any show as I was with episode 9, literally shouting at the screen ""show him a photo"".

Excellently written and superbly acted by the entire cast, bring on season two, as Irving exclaimed ""let's burn this place to the ground"".

Can't wait!!",literal
"The film is weak, dozens of soldiers fire volleys, the hero defends himself with a piece of sheet metal. mehhh Show for the generation that sees Marvel. I'm sorry, I interrupted watching the movie in the part where dozens of soldiers shoot with volleys and the hero of the movie defends himself with a shield while standing. While the bullets rain down, none hits him. It is a pleasant film for children and teenagers, but not for those who have more requests for films. It's been a long time since they've been making good movies, they're completely empty shows for slaves, while the critical sense has been lost and people just want to kill time and not see meaningful shows. Maybe it has to do with the state in which human society is. The film has the potential to be much nicer and better realized, but it didn't succeed.",literal
"Should have been a movie Thankfully the acting is fantastic throughout, otherwise it would be a real struggle to make it through the bulk of this show.

I think it starts well with a strong but simple premise. The tried and trusted - chaotic brother returns home and brings all of his problems with him. I think the last two episodes are great and what really makes this show worth watching, but the journey there leaves much more to be desired.

It's hard to break this show into 1st 2nd and 3rd acts as the first two mangle into one long slog of context and world building for characters that it is hard to care about. The 3rd act just about makes up for it but I can't help it wouldn't have worked much better in a feature film format opposed to an 8 hour show.

I was also let down with the promise of Jason Bateman leaving the straight man role and playing more of a chaotic character. I was excited to see this and while on paper it's there, I wasn't sold that he was as out of control as he was painted to be and was more a victim of his situations. On the other hand, Jude Laws character I found more and more deplorable as the story unfolded.

Complaints aside I did end up enjoying this, I thought the directing from Jason Bateman was fantastic as always. I specifically enjoyed some unexpected shots (following speeding car from a window, brothers talking on the phone from each side of the bridge), handheld camera work was really well done and some of the over the shoulder shots were awesome.

7/10 Worth a watch but don't get too excited.",figurative
"Tension between being manipulated and not It is 1975 and the USA is under an authoritarian regime, with thought-police and all. In this context is the Long Walk, a competition for eighteen year old boys that they win a lottery to compete in. There's one from each state, and whoever remains the last remaing walker in this competition wins...

This film is like Battle Royale or Hunger Games, sending young people to their deaths. It is about the friendships formed on the walk (like Battle Royale is, also) and that one person has to win. The deaths are graphic and the movie is well made and acted. The boys' attitude, personalities and interactions were a highlight.

I was concerned and slightly bothered that the film was being manipulative rather than showing us something to make up our own minds. Despite my concerns, I gave the movie a high 8/10, for it showed us enough of what was to be seen. Attempts to manipulate what we thought at multiple points of time were there too, but basically what was shown throughout was OK - not a true versimilitude for us to decipher for ourselves, but, it's OK. So, 8/10.",literal
"One of the worst films ever Boring, full of non-sense dialogues or none at all, flat and superficial character development, no plot. The movie wants to be artsy, but it's just pretentious.

We left the movie after the half of it, because nothing happens. The audience is left without a deeper understanding of the movie. Luckily, I did not have to pay for the movie. Good acting though.",literal
"Better than expected Got to see a few hours ago in IMAX which was magnificent even my sister was there and I'm pretty she loved it! Wicked should be up for awards especially for set design, acting and directing are all great aspects. I'm generally not a fan of musicals but glad I saw this wild ride a couple days before the wide release.

Cynthia and Ariana Grande were exceptional throughout they both deserve praise for their performances/exciting vibes! I had a long day I was little achy that was my complication otherwise this was delightful charming gem that will most likely be appreciated by most audiences as should be.",figurative
"It's unbelievable how far this has fallen I, like many others, started watching this with my gf. I actually loved it and continued watching it religiously even after that relationship ended.

The show has gone up and down throughout the years, but it's always come around in the end... That was true up until a couple years ago. The show used to be nuanced, focusing on the story and using a soft touch to help push a moral narrative. Well that's gone.

It is now so unbelievably preachy and completely lacks any sense of self awareness. I live perfectly in the middle of the political and social landscape. I always support people's personal choices yet this feels so gross and heavy handed. It's almost as if they decided to remove the fourth wall and turn it into a pulpit.

No one wants to watch a fictional cable drama that constantly brings up extremely controversial political and societal topics. We used these shows to escape the current unrest, not to be preached at about it.

They are treating their audience as if they are idiots, and (somehow) believe that their writing will enlightened them. It's hard to imagine how they got to this level of arrogance and grandiosity, it's truly hard to fathom.",figurative
"Talk about Defying Expectations! As a theatre kid and long-time lover of The Wizard of Oz and Wicked, I had high hopes for this film and prayed it would be all that and so much more. And that it was!

The performances, especially by Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, are Oscar-worthy. We see a whole new side to their insane talents and what they're truly capable of doing. Throughout the film, I had forgotten that it was Ariana as Glinda, because I saw her fully embody this role in the way that she said she would. She is HYSTERICAL and the whole theater couldn't stop giggling. Cynthia is an absolute powerhouse that left me left speechless after each star-studded performance. Having followed her journey for a while now, it came at no surprise the amazing beauty and strength she gave Elphaba. Together, they were radiating power, friendship and emotion.

The chemistry of the entire cast was lively and formed an environment that felt ethereal, along with the groundbreaking visuals of the settings! Wow. Just wow. It was beyond believable, and felt as if I was there, immersed in this world of Oz the entire film. And no, the trailers do not do this film justice and they don't spoil ANYTHING!

The musical numbers were traveling throughout my heart and soul, and it was an out of body experience that I will never forget.

This deserved two parts, and I see EXACTLY why it was split up. Yes, the film is long, BUT there is never a dull moment that arises. Each scene, each exchange is filled with its own magic.

Ariana, Cynthia, Jonathan, Jeff, Michelle, Ethan, Marissa, and the entire cast truly put their own unique twist on the songs, on the characters, all while paying homage to the original and to the Broadway show.

To Jon, this is what real cinema is. The camerawork and directing was something I had never seen carved. You have shattered the bar and allowed for more creativity to flow through and take over. Transcending time, going above and beyond the status quo and bringing us into the story. You absolutely nailed it and left no room for error. You truly defied gravity.

Bravo!",figurative
"Hazbin Hotel rocks! I love this show just as much as Helluva Boss. Of course, this show has a much better story to it than Helluva Boss does, but I still love both of them. My favorite characters of this show are Charlie, Vaggie, Alastor, Angel Dust, Niffty, Husk, Lucifer, and Emily. The animation in this is also much better and more improved than the pilot and the pilot isn't even canon anymore. Also the music and songs in this show are all awesome too and I can listen to them over and over again on my phone. Yep, this show kicks so much ass and it f...ing rocks! If you haven't watched it yet, go ahead and give it a watch. Ten out of ten for this.",literal
"The true Jurassic Lost World A good thrill ride of great Dino set pieces. This film shares alot with the concept of the lost world Jurassic park. While not quite as dark as that film, this one is darker than the three previous jurassic world movies, and for the better. The added realism creates great tension during several great set pieces in the middle section of the film. It is a shame it is let down by some poorly written characters, plot, and the usual unrealistic survivals. The ending section could of been better in creating more tension for the characters. However it's a solid scary family blockbuster. Arguably the best since the original.",literal
"It's great 4 years later Not surprising but the Animation is Beautiful

Jokes are funny and the tone is light but it can be the opposite of funny when the tone needs it. It hits hard.

The new characters are super well designed, I was wary about the voice actors but generally they all sounded great too.

I will say there's a lot of characters for 4 episodes it feels like a character gets introduced and gets to do one thing then we have to move on so we meet everyone in the first drop of the show. I get that but I feels like I really only know enough about half of the main cast and yet we also got introduced to overlords and angels that that would take up a good chunk of an episode but since they aren't main characters I feel like we won't see them again for a while, but I suppose we'll see next week I'm sure there's a method to the madness aha.

Overall I had a great time with the first 4 episodes but I kinda knew that was coming!",literal
"Big Bang theory has had its ups and downs with Seasons 8,9,10 and 11 but at the end of the day the show is a great watch I liked the first 6 or 7 seasons but the laugh tracks do get annoying but those first seven seasons do have a lot of classic episodes like the precious fragmentation or the staircase implementation or even the Russian rocket reaction. The show is a must watch especially for fans of pop culture and movies. Season 8 9 and 10 aren't the best but the end of season 10 is great no spoilers but it has a good ending. I still don't really like season 11 but that's my opinion you see the show you see it. The show is great quick breezy watch fun for the whole family and a must watch that's funny has problems but still great and I love it.",literal
Very disappointing ending It was all good until we reached the Final season And the twist at the last episode was very bad like really all what jon does he gets back to the freaking nights watch and dany is the mad queen for gods sake what the helllllllll hbo that's a very bad season We deserve better Ending,literal
"Cannot wait for the next episode! I prefer watching police procedural, crime TV series who could be a comedy, a romance or a thriller at times, in general. But this one works like a charm for me too. Because this is like ""Les Miserables"", my favorite novel telling the story of close historical period. Also, I should admit I like watching TV shows having good looking cast members just like Poldark. But actors performances are also deserve standing ovation. Although this is a remake of Poldark, it is the first version I have ever watched and I really like this one. I won't write a spoiler here. So, if you like watching TV series with intrigue, romance, endeavor, drama, hope and despair my advice is just watch for yourself. After watching then come here and write your review about the series too. Good entertainment!",literal
"The Villians I've noticed that all crime series shuffle the actors who play the villian. In the latest episode, that actor has been on many series. Kind of tired of seeing them over and over. Surely Hollywood does not lack actors. Please.",literal
"Really Rough Writing This was rough. Apart from Kim's stony face and dead pan delivery, the writing was just really off. It tries too hard to be like Sand the City ish but it missed the mark. The rest of the cast was fine, exciting even, but there is such an unbalance in talent. Dont even get me started with how awfully dramatic they tried to make some scenes that were dry as the Sahara.",literal
"Great series Great twists and turns complex storyline. Very good watch. Jude Law, and Jason Bateman deliver hell of performance leave you wanting more after every episode great plot line through and through Netflix delivered another great series with this dark series would definitely recommend to anybody who likes drama.",literal
"All too Crazy Scandinavian Flick (maybe WAY too Crazy) Finnish director Jaimari Helanderin immediately presents us a clear action told in a linear and flowing way, which soon generates an atmosphere mixed between those of Leone and Tarantino, a Western feeling evoked by the wide and desert plains of Lapland, by the division into chapters and by the attitudes of all the characters, to then immerse everything in a violence without restraints and full of the most exaggerated inventiveness.

Obviously all this without reaching the much more studied and refined levels of those two authors, and perhaps lingering too much on the desire to make everything so spectacular and unlikely at all costs, also due to a maybe too bright photography, and by having taken all English-speaking interpreters to play the Germans, making them speak with a cadenced English, another way perhaps to make everything more international.

This is contrasted, however, by the performance of the true protagonist, Jorma Tommila, who without uttering a word conveys the full sense of a man who is alone but far from broken, a warrior ready to unleash all of the fury of a war beast, thanks to an absolutely uncommon strategic brain with which he deceives and strikes his adversaries.

The other members of the cast also play their roles well, with Aksel Hennie in the role of the historical figure of Bruno Helldorf, willing to obtain the gold at any cost, even by deferring to the orders of his superiors and the hesitations of his subordinates, regardless of the real strength of the enemy.

So, all in all an original divertissment full of high-sounding action that demonstrates a great European inventiveness within the genre, but which could also alienate by virtue of its voluntarily exaggerated nature, but no less full of all the most inexhaustible inner strength.",literal
"Outstanding cast, impeccable writing Honestly, this series may rank in my top 10 if not higher. Keri Russell completely owns that character. The rest of the cast is extremely well cast. The story is intricate without being confusing, and quite believable. The dialogue is nearly flawless. You never feel like it's too clever for its own good, in fact sometimes it's quite brutal. Especially when the two main characters are talking to each other. So good to see Allison Janney make a star turn here. She is absolutely flawless as usual. There is literally nothing about this series that I don't love. It's one of the few that I absolutely binged in one night for each season. I cannot wait for season three because there's no way the story is over in fact it's just warming up. Well well done to all involved and thank you so much Netflix for green lighting the show.",literal
"Covid PTSD The first half truly gave me covid PTSD. I relived moments I had forgot about and im so glad thats all over. The hate and arguments, the way everyone went wild. Family vs family. The drama. The hate. The protests. All of it. It truly triggers some core memories of 2020-2022. It was absolutely fantastic until about halfway through the movie, then it went a weird way. Still good and it kind of kept in theme, but i wasnt for it. I loved it until the moment he started using the gun. It just felt like to much but the places it went after that was interesting. I guess it just felt off from the first half. The whole relationship thing was weird the entire time. Still a good movie but could have been better with how great the first half was.

Watched at AMC on 7-22-2025.",literal
"Masterclass in Anxiety, yes; tour de force Rose, yes; Must-see, no This is a very hard movie to give a number to.

The performance is in the realm of tour de force, which in itself doesn't make for ""must-see."" As one fan of the movie here said ""but it's not for everyone,"" and that included me and my husband (who'd chosen the movie partly as he often does because I'm a therapist and he knows--it's true--that that factor can interest me enough to elevate engagement with a problematic film). I never read reviews until after seeing a film so i'm used to ""going in blind"" with just the faintest notion of either what it's about or who's in it ... But we only survived as long as the hamster did. Not long after and the bizarre back-to-the-scene-of-the-trauma of her ceiling hole, with an hour yet to go, our own usually very benefit-of-the-doubt-stick-it-out resilience meters had seen enough to wonder what this was doing to our own nervous systems to experience it. Curious though that it wasn't a kind of anxiety film that made me tense. I think because, despite or maybe because of being a therapist, i was not identifying. I was engaged by the plot (nightmare) but not by the story, if that distinction makes sense to you.

I only write this because i think people might not want to take ""must-see"" at face value but perhaps to know enough about the film to consider whether you might prefer to not be nonstop in the role of observer of a ship going down, so to speak.

Rose's performance struck as being in a class of roles that at least used to be seen as sure Oscar-winners, like Rain Man or My Left Foot (although i hate to put the latter in the same breath because what was devastating about Daniel Day Lewis's performance was transcendent (as i recall) but it's the intensity of a character's role and life on film that can be an ""over the top"" degree of intensity that sometimes is just too much. That for us was true here.

Oh, and don't go to Conan O'Brien('s character) for therapy.",figurative
"Been there, seen that. People who think this show is original have obviously not watched anything but Breaking Bad.

Body Snatchers meets The World's End and that covers about 90% of the first episode already.

That would be ok if the writing was not so abysmal. The dialog is terrible. Everything is set up so obviously it's utterly predictable.

And then you get an exposition scene with Carol talking to the tv for 10 mn... and the genius at casting thought the best actor to speak for the aliens would be... a third rate soap actor? So convincing.

I'll pass.",literal
"Come on critics, it's fiction! The story story is captivating in the beginning. As the plot thickens, it becomes more alluring. The Wylers' relationship is unpredictable & unorthodox yet compelling. There's an entire history to the couples madness that's briefly summarized. Similar to some of the characters, we begin to understand & rationalize some of the overtly reactionary behaviors of the misses.

The character, Dennison, plays the role that I would usually define as ""the unnecessary chaos"". Without giving spoilers, I'll just say that he's definitely necessary. He may be my favorite character.

I read reviews before & after watching the series. There seems to be an obsession with comparing a fictional story and reality. Since the beginning of time, fictional stories were told using real places, real labels, &, most of the time, aligns with current Allies and conflict. This is necessary, not only for staying away from fantasy type fictions & allowing the audience to easily remember the storyline, but to also sell a product without the risk of insulting more people than not. In addition, with most plots, there's no depiction of a ""perfect"" or ""completely guilty"" country in this series. That's satisfying enough for someone who likes to think of entertainment as an escape from reality. They're telling a story, not a documentary. Remember this when rating a fictional story in which your review is based on your reality bias's.

Finally, the cliff hanger was cruel. Great for the series but frustrating for me. WHAT HAPPENED??? I'll be waiting for season 2. Great job!",literal
"Can't overstate the greatness here. Name any other show you like, I've watched it. And the other great ones, all of them. Numerous times. Loved them, even. But this is the best thing ever made, bar none. This is not Goodfellas Godfather shlock. This is the finest character study ever filmed. And James Gandolfini is the most mesmerizing protagonist in television history. Come at me.",literal
"Brown and boring Story: Let's make the monster into something more like a superhero, that can take 20 shots without any problem, and that can breath under water. Then let's make the storytelling a bit artsy fartsy and while we're at it let's make the dialogue cringe and a bit pompous too.

The look: Let's tint everything in brown and blue. And, you know what; let's make it a bit... hmmm, almost fuzzy. Then we'll turn down the lighting so the movie becomes even darker, and even more boring to look at.

Now: Let's look at the good reviews that always pops up like magic, and let us all laugh all the way to the bank. The End.

Ah, while we're at it, please tell me, why make a whole new body of different body parts - when you can just take a full body and reanimate that instead? Stupid, right?",literal
"Great new Mike White Series Mike White, the director & writer of The White Lotus is not everybody's cup of tea. But if you get his dark, twisted humor you will love this new show. Very promising start. Great characters, excellent actors and a tropical paradise vacation which took the wrong turn. Even if you are in a beautiful place, you cannot escape yourself. Perfect show for summer to remind us that even though we all long for a change of scenery after months of lockdown, some vacations can go horribly wrong. What I very much like is that the stories are twisted and dark, but still realistic and human.",literal
"Crazy The premise of this is so crazy, you just have to take it as it comes. Lizzy is annoying. She and Josh are supposed to be control freaks and she is on the high end of that. Billy is totally the opposite. I tend to be a planner so I don't know if I could stand to spend any time with him.

There are a lot of good gags and lines, but I had a hard time relaxing and enjoying this. I don't really like movies where one of the intended romantic leads is already in a committed relationship with someone else. It feels like cheating. In a real way it is cheating. And I also really dislike stories with a wedding ruined at the altar. I think this movie might be a blast if you can set that aside.

Like any good story, there needs to be a conflict or obstacle. Even though it was obvious something like this was coming, it was still interesting.

Except for the dates on the calendar this movie has almost nothing to do with Christmas. There is one Christmas event and it comes and goes and really isn't significant in the story.",literal
"A compelling and thought-provoking Movie with strong performances. Sinners draw viewers into a world of mystery. Its deliberate pacing allows deep exploration of complex themes, enhanced by stunning visuals and powerful performances, particularly Michael B. Jordan under Ryan Coogler's direction.

The cast's impeccable accents perfectly capture the setting, while the solid theme songs, deeply rooted in the blues, enrich the film's atmosphere and narrative. Sinners excel at provoking thought on forgiveness, consequences, and the human spirit. It's a compelling watch that leaves a lasting impression, prompting reflection long after it concludes. A must-see for those who appreciate cinema that truly makes you think.",literal
"Worst Show Ever Not even funny. Humor and lines are stale and overused. Cast members are boring and predictable. I can only hope that this pathetic show gets canceled.

Especially since it follows The Neighborhood where Cedric the Entertainer is so funny and on point.

I don't think that new writers or a new script would help this helpless show .",literal
"Had potential but it was nothing new or refreshing I had high hopes going into this film. I was one of the people who backed this film. I love horror and was a fan of Stuckman. But this is full of cliches and nothing was fully flushed out. I think the concept was good and could have been great with more creativity. It was different by way of the entity but was not different in the way it was used. Things didn't make sense all the time and I'm left with more questions than answers. So yeah, no. Good try though.",literal
"Amazing Characterization and Storyline This is the first time that I am placing my review in IMDB all because I really love this TV series. The story is carefully written and the characterization was well planned. This TV series has all the genre you can think off from horror, thriller, romance, sci fi and comedy. It portrays true friendship and the ups and down of every teenager.

It tackles familial issues, like Joyce being a single mom and trying make ends meet and Mrs Wheeler who seems to be an unhappy wife who always had a glass of wine in the dining table.

It also love how it portrays all kinds of love. I like how El and Mike relationship started as a puppy love and progressed into a more mature relationship. I also love how they portrayed Mike's feelings towards Mike. You see at Mike's age he must still be confused on how he feels towards Mike.

The attention to detail is also remarkable. Believe it or not I have watched this series thrice already and I still cannot move on. I feel like I can rewatch it all over again because of the surprising details in the show.

If you haven't watched it yet I dare you... just give it a try. Anyone at any age will surely love this amazing show.",literal
"Original but lacking courage on third act and better script. I liked the movie. Enjoyed my cinema time. However, I have a few complains:

1 - When you make a Coral narrative (multiple points of view) you must be very careful to not spread them too thin and lose the audience. Why show two main investigation lines (Josh + Garner / Police officer + young man) getting to the same place, without even crossing paths, if you do not dive deep in any of them?

Why not exclude the cop + young man and give us more background to connect to Julia Garner and the investigation of Josh? I mean, Josh draw two lines in a map and voilá? Police couldn't figure that out?

2 - I really tought that when Josh is dreaming and the weapon appears in the sky it would follow a narrative of subtle appearances to haunt the audience. Just like the demon appears subtly, multiple times, on Longlegs. Or just how the cult members are present all over Hereditary. You never see the signs if you don't know what you are looking for, but they are there.

But no. The weapon shows once and period. It seems disconnected. What for?

3 - The third act lacked courage, to me. A horror movie gets its grip on you either by shocking you and making you scary of its monstruosity or by leaving you in the dark to fantasy the monsters and fears for youself.

The movie does the latter in the first act, but reveals its villan and ""magic"" in the second. Right there, when they pull the veil of the ""what"" and ""why"", the fear goes away altogether. And that is okay, but you need to transform it on something else.

I think that the movie tried to do that on a all out third act, but it lacked spirit. It lacked the courage to go all in and show a witch for what it is: a person on communion with other forces (nature / dark forces). Instead, we got to laugh a little of a bunch of children pursuing an old lady - which was okay, but it let me wishing for something else.",literal
"Go away Amy Love everything about this show from the opening credits to the cast to the music.

"Usually a fan of mockumentary style shows Shallow characters, unengaging storyline, mundane, unappealing, and just not at all funny. How this show was greenlit, and allowed to air is truly beyond me.

"Disturbingly brilliant I have been waiting to watch this for some time now and I am not disappointed! Evan Peters portrayal of Jeffery Dahmer is a masterpiece.

Right from the beginning I was hooked & throughout, it was very accurate to the real facts behind the horrific story of Dahmer.

All the actors starring in this were fantastic, great selection.

Usually with serial killer programmes/series they're not good, they feel very fake but this was not.

Ryan Murphy needs to do more series on serial killers as he very talented and can portray their lives in a way that keeps the viewer hooked. I can not wait to see what else he brings out.

Definitely worth a watch.",figurative
"Makes me want chicken nuggies Aziz Ansari's first feature is actually a pretty good one. It's a film that doesn't overstay it's welcome and has some good points to make about the class divide we face in the world currently. Also, it's actually funny, and not in a gross out, trying to shock you kind of way.

Firstly, the acting in the film was spot on. Most everyone did a great job in their respective roles. My only complaint, again, is Seth Rogan. He just can't act as anything other than him. That's all we get. I guess that's fine for the role, but I'm kinda sick of his schtick. Reeves did an excellent job with his role as Gabriel. His delivery was perfect.

Secondly, the film has surprisingly great use of color and composition. Aziz knew how to make these scenes pop as much as he could. I would like to see what he'd do with a bigger budget and locales.

Lastly, the story hit surprisingly close to home. It's a struggle that I, and millions of other people, have faced in my life and it was interesting to see it on screen in such a matter of fact way. Kudos to you Aziz for writing a funny AND realistic film. Only thing unrealistic is the ending. If given the choice myself, I'm not too sure I would have made the same decision the main character does.

Overall, I would recommend it. It was thought provoking, but in a light hearted way. The themes were heavy but the cast and the comedy do a good job of carrying you through til the end. Plus, you have Keanu Reeves as an angel who smokes, drinks, eats tacos and dances without a care in the world.

"Passable. High praise is unjustfied A vampire flick set in the blues-soaked south, just after the civil war. If that juxtaposition blows you away, which it really shouldn't, then this is your masterpiece. It hardly treads on new ground, with From Dusk till Dawn or Cowboys & Aliens in mind, and the high praise does not feel earned. I am saddened to see it is another movie that got pushed not through its own merits, more because of the racial background of the creators. That said, it isn't bad either. It will do. It is a stale cup of tea without a biscuit. Michael B. Jordan puts in a solid performance. And the movie does not overstay its welcome.",figurative
"Cheesey Soap The beautiful scenery is great but the characters and plot are as deap as mud puddles! Attempted to cover all DEI bases but forgot to include solid scipts/acting skill. CBS just can't produce shows even close to NBC productions.

Also the show appears to be totally unrealistic relative to the majority of segments. Solid concept but poor execution!",literal
"I'm Confused Here... What is all the hype about? Vince Gilligan's talented. Sure. Rhea Seehorn was great in Better Call Saul, especially the finale.

But what in the world is going on in this show?

Production values seem B-movie grade. Maybe that's the point?

The plot is frankly ridiculous.

Other than Seehorn, the acting is hard to take, even given the premise that almost all characters are alien-possessed.

But the behavior of Carol (Seehorn) doesn't resonate. Some of her reactions feel authentic, while others defy logic and reason.

If you walk into an ER and every person is paralyzed and shaking uncontrollably, what would you do? Certainly not stick around, or try to talk to them, or (God Forbid) touch them. And yet, that's all of what Carol does.

The rest is full of holes, silliness and set pieces that showcase Seehorn's ability to perform rage and frustration.

Apparently there are people that find this ""amazing"" and ""masterful"".

Maybe the entire series is Carol having an existential crisis in the bar where all the strangeness begins, and the last episode will be her coming to in a hospital. Or maybe this is just bad.

But. I. Don't. Get. It.

Bummer.",literal
"Keeps getting better This has become my favorite regular show on the main networks.  The stories are good enough to keep me watching and the character interplay can be quite amusing at times.  Gibbs is great...watching the others react to him makes me chuckle.  Abby is perfectly believable, despite the goth overtones...she is strong, smart, yet still sexy and feminine.  I think Pauley Perette was the ideal actress to cast.  The writing seems to continue at an even keel...if nothing else getting better as more episodes are shown.  I think the producers have a hit here.  I go back each week.  Definitely worth your time...even if it means taping or tivo'ing it (which I do)...something to look forward to when I can't make 8:00 on Tuesday.",literal
"Watchable, but not too smooth Black Rabbit presents itself as a slow-burning crime drama, drawing viewers in with big-name stars - Jason Bateman and Jude Law - and a dark, cinematic atmosphere. Both actors deliver raw, committed performances, and their tense relationship as brothers adds just enough emotional depth to get the story going. The gritty Manhattan backdrop, sharp cinematography, and a few genuinely tense moments help create an engaging experience early on.

However, despite its strong setup, the series struggles with uneven storytelling. The premise has promise, but the pacing often feels sluggish, dragged down by slow scenes, overly stylized shots, and frequent (and sometimes confusing) time jumps. Many plot twists seem unearned - more about shocking the audience or filling time than showing real character development. As the series goes on, the main characters become increasingly unlikable, making it harder to stay emotionally invested.

Ironically, the supporting characters often seem more interesting, but they don't get enough attention. Relationships between characters feel shallow or poorly developed, with key emotional moments either rushed or forced. Some of the dialogue feels clunky, and there are plot holes - like characters making choices that don't make sense - that hurt the story's credibility.

That said, Black Rabbit still has its moments. Fans of slow-burn thrillers might enjoy it, especially for Bateman's standout performance. But viewers hoping for a tight, emotionally powerful drama like Ozark may come away disappointed.

In the end, Black Rabbit has flashes of brilliance but often stumbles under its own ambition. It's stylish and suspenseful - just not as gripping as it wants to be. A shorter run - maybe six episodes instead of more - might have helped tighten the story and made it more effective overall.",figurative
"Nobody does it better. The concept of a so-called 'dad movie' is a bit of a strange one; it isn't something you can so easily define, but it is something you can instantly feel. The connecting tissue between all 'dad movies' seems to be a middle-aged or older protagonist performing unexpectedly youthful feats of athleticism in the name of fame or family, seemingly so that the dads in the audience can live vicariously through the dads (or sometimes not dads) they see on screen. However, 'dad movies' cross all genres, as likely to be about out-of-retirement assassins as older-than-expected racecar drivers, and their heroes often aren't exactly the ideal that real dads should aspire to. They also vary greatly in how much they actually appeal to anyone not currently in their dad era. What's interesting is that 'dad movies' don't seem to be linked to specific generations; today's 'dad movies' are as likely to appeal to today's dads as yesterday's 'dad movies', whether or not said dads liked the 'dad movies' their dads liked before they became dads. Dad is a weird word now. I better stop using it.

The point is that 'Nobody 2 (2025)', the sequel to Bob Odenkirk's unexpected foray into 'John Wick (2015)' territory that proved anyone can be an action star if they train hard enough, is undeniably a 'dad movie'. That doesn't mean it's a bad movie, though. In fact, it's far from it. This vacation-based follow-up is exactly what you expect, but - unlike many features to which that applies - it's also exactly what it needs to be. Any subversion to its formula would likely have diluted its specific power as a three-star movie that's also definitely going to be someone's favourite film of the year, an experience that isn't brought down by flaws or raised up by highlights but is instead steadily entertaining and designed to scratch a specific itch that can't be sated by the same methods used to alleviate the desire for a great movie. This all sounds rather backhanded, I'm sure, but it isn't intended to be. With a penchant for high-octane hand-to-hand and a bevy of charismatic central performances, this is the kind of film the streaming era wishes it could produce on a regular basis. Its simplicity is its strength, its sub-ninety-minute runtime its superpower. It's fast, it's furious, it's silly, it's sincere, it's absurd, and its completely confident in its ability to deliver exactly what the dads in its crowd demand. It's a satisfying, exciting, violent delight with creative choreography, pulpy dialogue, and a breakneck pace that leaves no room for boredom. When it barrels into its finale, it leaves you with the sense that it could've been a bit longer and you wouldn't have minded. However, it's well-known that you should leave your audience wanting more, and this definitely does that. It's slight, but it's successful. It isn't going to change your world, but it'll keep it spinning nicely. It's the sort of down-the-barrel, wonderfully modest, subtly sly actioner that you don't see as much of on the big screen anymore. I don't think it's fantastic, but I'd love to see a new one of these every single year. Bring back three-star R-rated blockbusters; I'd much rather see those than three-star PG-13 superhero pictures.

As a random aside, I find it interesting how the 'old-man action-star' genre is subject to inflation. After all, Liam Neeson was considered old for an action hero when he kickstarted the genre with 'Taken (2008)' over fifteen years ago, but he was only 55. Tom Cruise is now 63 (which is older than Bob Odenkirk, by the way) and he's never even been mentioned in the same sentence as the word 'old'. Cruise may be responsible for our ever-changing definition of the term, as he's been at this since the 1980s and he constantly performs feats of athleticism that further put those who put their back out from sleeping in a funny position to shame (the real impossible mission may be convincing him to retire). The other responsible factor is that the action genre is so comparatively sparse these days that no young blood is really breaking through. Add that to our current obsession with nostalgia, Hollywood's vice-like grip on proven safe bets, and the movie industry's push towards IP rather than stars, and the result is that our action heroes are getting older every year and there will be nobody to replace them when they eventually decide they aren't as out-of-their-minds as Tom Cruise. Of course, I have nothing against older actors kicking ass on screen (I can't wait to see John Wick killing people with his Zimmer frame), but I just find it interesting that the only thing that now denotes a film as an 'old-man actioner' is how often the baddies refer to the hero as 'grandpa', 'old man' or something to that effect. At least it makes it more satisfying for the similarly aged dads in the crowd when the younger villains get knocked into next week by someone they think of as an over-the-hill older citizen.",literal
Just doesn't make the grade This series could have been so much better but ends up being a wasted opportunity. The writing is bad and the editing even worse. The story moves around to the point where the viewer starts to wonder if there are some scenes missing. The gaps created in the narrative leads to a lack of story continuity and ultimately loss of viewer interest and engagement . The story doesn't seem to go anywhere and just limps along in a meaningless manner. The humor is dull and there is little depth to the series that could make it interesting. The cast seems to be a mix of SNL and a few B rated has been actors. Ricky Martin's character looks like it's made of wax. Apple isn't one of the leading streaming platforms and it's poorly written series like this that support that reputation!,literal
"Is there one? It's not PC I know to mention that sometimes charges are FALSE. Is there ONE episode of SVU whereas the accuser is lying? I like this show, and certainly enjoy seeing violent perps go down for their crimes. Where's the OTHER side of the story though?",literal
"Excellent follow up movie Just back from the Cinema, I had no idea how they were going to follow up the first film, but they've done a great job with this film.

"This would bode much better as a series. Once again, a Stephen King story, or in this case, a Richard Bachman novella gets a Hollywood make over that does not work. The biggest problem I see with his work is it's very difficult to do character development in a 2 hour movie. I know The Shining is well loved by many, but it's truly a poor adaptation of the book. The miniseries was much better. The same thing can be said about ""IT"". The miniseries was excellent, but the two movies were CGI clotted garbage.

The Long Walk is tailor made to be a series because there are so many characters that are begging to have their stories told. Trying to do this in a 2 hour time frame, it will be forced with missing context.

Hopefully the go with the series way of telling this story some day.",figurative
"my new favorite show I created an IMDb account specifically to review this show. Having never seen the original I cannot speak to how it compares but I will say that if you are hearing (and viewing) this story for the first time, it is quite good. The acting is superb, the casting of Aiden Turner is perfect. I especially like the character Prudie. The scenery is gorgeous and the story line captivating. A definitely must see for anyone who enjoys period pieces. Not much of a history buff so I don't know how historically accurate the props are, but if you are looking for a new Sunday night regular, this is a good one. Great entertainment, I can't wait for more. Usually I do not individual TV episodes more than once but have already watched both Poldark episodes three times each. I find myself foregoing my regular programs in order to re-watch the Poldark episodes. I would like to see a bit more action in this particular series. I feel like a good throw down between Ross and Francis is not only inevitable, but I would find it welcome. I almost found myself wanting Captain Blamey to kill Francis during the duel in the middle of episodes two. I was disappointed that he didn't die but I guess it leaves it open for the future.",literal
"Went to a Secret Screening of this Edgar Wright's 2025 reboot hits HARD - think less neon cheese, more raw adrenaline. Glen Powell leads a cast that's fierce, fast, and frighteningly real.

This isn't your dad's dystopia. It's King's nightmare, finally unleashed.

2025 vs 1987

Tone & Style: The 1987 version was campy, colorful, and full of Schwarzenegger one-liners. The 2025 reboot is darker, more grounded, and closer to King's original vision.

Faithfulness to the book: Wright's adaptation leans heavily into the novel's bleakness and social critique, unlike the original which turned it into a flashy action flick.

Lead performance: Glen Powell brings emotional depth and desperation to Ben Richards, a stark contrast to Schwarzenegger's stoic action-hero portrayal.

World-building: The new film expands the dystopian universe with richer visuals and a more sinister corporate backdrop.

Action & pacing: While the original thrived on spectacle, the reboot builds tension through psychological stakes and moral ambiguity.

Great nod to the original in the movie too.",literal
"Best film of 2025 Poignant, beautifully acted, and visually stunning, the movie captures the complexity of human connection with rare honesty.

"Captures the feeling of Summer It's always disappointing - even just a little - when a favored childhood movie doesn't have the same sheen when viewed through adult eyes. Thankfully, ""The Sandlot"" is not one of those, and I think it's because of the this is a great group of kids; they have a nice camaraderie and their natural ball-busting is right for that age. That is, until James Earl Jones walks in and steals the movie, but that's a whole other virtue. 

But all of the comedic elements still retain their value, and it helps that it's in the nostalgic spirit of something like ""A Christmas Story"" (really feels like it should've been narrated by Jean Shepherd). My wife even thought of it as a fluffy ""Stand By Me"".

It's easy to write this off as a kids movie, but it's too versatile for that.",figurative
"We're really throwing stuff at the wall to see if it will stick We're really throwing stuff at the wall to see if it will stick

I am underwhelmed by this first episode with all the demon baby CGI that's pulled from the second It movie. It makes sense in that film because so many of the characters are in arrested development as adults but having kids be afraid of child birth and mutant babies feels like a stretch. It's feel like man baby adult writing to be afraid of something so arch and dripping with subtext for a series that is all about Pennywise predating on children because their fears are so small, everyday scenes that build to a hyper visceral scare.

I guess I am happy theyre gesturing towards a higher body count as a result of this being a prequel and every series is supposed to kick back 27 years prior. So instead of a triumphant group of 7, this cast is going to need to be weeded down episode after episode to power Pennywises hybernation. But that's something I'm gonna play by ear.

It was also super funny to see the Derry airbase introduced and then justified for no reason. I'm rereading Salems Lot and so much of that book as about how small a town SK will set a book in to the point where industry has dried up and most of the professional working people are driving +45 min to other medium sized towns or Portland or Bangor. So having a show that just assumes everything has to be Derry adjacent just feels like an unnecessary put on.",literal
"So Many Choices, So Little Courage The premise is intriguing - what happens In the afterlife when a person had multiple happy marriages.

This takes us through one possibility. You show up looking like you did when you were the happiest in life, and you pick from one of the many eternities available. The conflict here is that you can choose to wait for someone to join you. Hence the two husbands, both waiting.

There were at least 7 different ways this movie could have ended. They chose the banal, trite, cloying, safe one. By doing that it feels like everything between the arrival and that ending was wasted.

I gave it 5 stars - 1 for the cowardly ending and 4 for the premise.",literal

"Used to love it, watch older episodes regularly This show was riveting. The casting directors did a phenomenal job with getting a great cast that worked well off one another - in the beginning. After season 13, it's not the same. I've tried watching later episodes, but couldn't engage. I now understand why the older shows are the ones on repeat during the binge watching weekends. They had the story's and cast that drew you in. Now, it's just a faded shadow of how it was. Castings of the new actors has fallen short. Even the veterans of the show are trying to carry it, but need a solid team to make that happen. I miss Mark Harmon's regular role and cast that came from the beginning through to 2013.",literal

"I'm in between It was watchable but I didn't love it.

I'm not sure just how involved Burton actually was with this project, it doesn't feel like he was massively involved because this series really didn't scream ""Burton-esque"" to me. He supposedly directed the series, but a few different directors' names pop up in the credits?

I was excited to see it when I found out Tim's name was attached to it, but it ended up being far too ""teeny high school drama"" for my liking.

I did like Jenna Ortega as Wednesday, I thought she portrayed the character well and made it her own. Uncle Fester was okay as well. And Thing, but, ya know, he's a hand. The casting for the rest of the Addams however, I didn't like; they just didn't capture the essence of the characters in my eyes.

I've followed this show since it began till the movie, and the only reason I'm giving an 8 instead of a 10, it's RORY. She begins being a sweet, determined girl, and as she grows, begins dating married guys and taking bad decisions for herself. Of course no one is perfect, but she stops being so likable, relatable. Becomes a person who never struggles for money, who has an amazing job, and other aspects millennials can't be related to. Still, my biggest issue is Rory growing. Supposedly, as you grow up you become wiser, more smart and sensitive but she goes backwards. Lorelai instead, DOES grow up to the point she's no longer scared of real vulnerability with a partner and of opening her own business.

"We need more of Sandra Oh! I thought this show was going to be around first year interns at a Seattle Hospital. I wasn't expecting Meredith Grey to be the central character. I love watching Sandra Oh and Patrick Dempsey. They are both excellent actors themselves. With the success of Sideways, Sandra can be singing all the way to the bank. She is very entertaining to watch even in this show. I would say this is an average show. I like the fact that Meredith is the daughter of a famous surgeon who now does not remember her own name possibly from Alzheimer's disease. I do not understand networks who keep trying to use the same familiar surroundings like a hospital or a police station in dramas. There are too many dramas on today. I would much rather have something original. Since it comes after Desperate Housewives, it is not a bad show. It just needs time to grow. There are good episodes sometimes but I think the characters are so involved in their personal love lives that they have forgotten medicine sometimes. I don't think this show is evolving appropriately to combine love, medicine, story lines, and a mixture of it equally. I love Kate Burton who appears as Ellis Grey, Meredith's mother.

"The 2020 movie When Eddington was first announced as a dark comedy/Western about COVID, it instantly felt like the kind of thing that had a small chance of being great, but a larger chance of missing the mark completely. I would have faith in Ari Aster, but Beau Is Afraid, while admirable, was a bit too messy to be great. I didn't feel the anxiety watching it that others seemed to. It did seem to speak to many people, but not me. It felt like Aster making an everything film, and one entirely for him. I'd wager it's his favourite of the ones he's directed, but it was too much as an outsider.

Eddington is not as sprawling, and feels more refined, even though it's also tackling a lot. It's longer than it needs to be, but still more direct than Beau, given that one was three hours, versus 2.5 here.

There is a certain madness captured here quite well. Lots of this does feel like how 2020 felt, and I imagine it'll be a valuable time capsule. I also imagine most people don't want to see this kind of movie now, since it still strikes a raw nerve, but I admire Aster again for going for it.

It's still probably a bit long. It's a film that shakes things up tonally and narratively without warning, and I like that while appreciating you need a fair bit of runtime to do that, but it's not entirely smooth sailing. But I did like more than I disliked, and I was happy to be surprised about where it went in terms of story (which is why I don't want to explain the plot here).

It's not going to be a classic, like Aster's first two movies, but I think it's a step in the right direction after Beau Is Afraid (which I didn't even hate by any means; I just didn't feel it like I think I was supposed to).",figurative

"One of the biggest surprises of 2025 Roofman (2025) is a crime comedy movie starring Channing Tatum as real-life spree robber Jeffrey Manchester who hid out in a toy store. This is a movie I went in with a good amount of expectations and the movie overdelivered in every way imaginable.

Positives for Roofman (2025): I love how this movie takes real life events and put a comedic spin on the story and the filmmakers do it in a way that actually works. You also have a fantastic ensemble cast in the movie including Channing Tatum, Kirsten Dunst, Ben Mendelsohn, LaKeith Stanfield, Juno Temple, Melonie Diaz, Uzo Aduba, Lily Collias and Peter Dinklage who are all great. Obviously, Channing Tatum is charming as Jeffrey Manchester which is something that shouldn't work, but Tatum is one of those guys who has this natural likable to him that you can't help but love his characters. I also loved his chemistry with Kirsten Dunst and her character makes him a better person who wants to do good for the people around him. For some reason I love how this real life spree robber spent time hiding in a Toys ""R"" Us store and it leads to some great comedic moments that were awesome. I do like how Jeffrey tries to flee the country and start a new life for himself, only for his willingness t not abandon Leigh gets him arrested at the end and spent back to jail. And finally, the pacing of this movie is great and it is over 2 hours long which is insane to say because comedy movies shouldn't be that long, but the filmmakers made it work for me.

Overall, Roofman (2025) is one of the biggest surprises of 2025 for me and is easily one of the best movies of the year.",literal

"Only Rating The New Show ""Evolution"" While the previous series of Criminal Minds was a good standard FBI procedural that did have a few outstanding plot lines over the course of it's initial run, it pales in comparison to the 2022 reboot ""Criminal Minds Evolution"". The original series suffered from an annoying amount of unnecessary & frivolous main and ancillary characters. The departure of Shemar Moore as Derek Morgan was much needed! Moore's character Morgan's constant 1980s valley girlesque banter with Kirsten Vangsness' character Penelope Garcia was must mute TV. The new leaner, meaner ""Evolution"" keeps the essential cast members, while personal story telling is still intertwined it does not get in the way of the plot. The 10 episode season is the best season they have created and the best of the show ""reboots"" from any platform I've seen. Without any spoilers they manage to work in an individual serial killer case, intertwined with a much larger 'killer network' narrative, catching up with the character's lives, a realistic take on the current politicized nature of the FBI & how it affects operations and a great cliffhanger.

"It is among the best period series It is among the series that classic British history lovers should not ignore. The originality of their music, the naturalness and expressiveness of the shooting locations, and the harmony between the energies of the actors, allow you to be isolated from the world for a short time. Although I did not like the finale of the series, the fact that it has an engrossing story in general makes it impatient to move on to the next episode.",literal
"Sisu I did quite enjoy this, but you really do have to be prepared to leave your common sense at the door. It's all about a man ""Aatami"" (Jorma Tommila) who having had a brutal WWII already, has taken refuge in the remote Finnish wilderness where he is panning for - and finds - gold. Packing up, he sets off for civilisation but en route, encounters a dishevelled Nazi tank patrol under the command of ""Bruno"" (Aksel Hennie). Initially, they have little interest in the pilgrim, but some gunfire and explosions shortly after he passes them piques their interest and soon the most perilous of manhunts is engaged. The ""Sisu"" myth is based around a person who is not immortal, but who simply refuses to die - and ""Aatami"" certainly fits the bill. He flirts with knives, bullets, landmines and even the noose but death clearly doesn't want him just yet! Can he get his gold to the bank? It is gory, this film, but I found in quite a light-hearted way. Limbs blown hither and tither but somehow not in a menacing, or scary, fashion. Indeed, at times the action is actually mildly entertaining - especially when the women prisoners are given the opportunity for some good old-fashioned revenge. It's told with an hybrid Guy Ritchie or Sergio Leone style, episodically, and for the first hour works quite well. The tail end, though, falls away as the film - always of questionable plausibility - becomes just a little bit too ""A-Team"". There isn't much dialogue to comment on - no bad thing; and the action comes thick and fast in a production that is wonderfully illustrative of the bleakness of this environment (and of some with an human soul).",literal
Oh Sure... White men bad. Women good. Things were looking good till Dakota fanning gave divorce over an issue that literally could have been solved with a long discussion or an intervention but nah. Sure Peter Irvine was evil but killing him? I mean she could have divorced him or there were a few other options but nah. What else can you expect from a series directed by 2 white liberal women who hate men. Victim mentality much? They just dialed the female rage to 11 in the last 2 episodes. I got duped with the first few episodes but slowly patterns begun to emerge. A solid 1.5.,literal
"Best tv show of the year! Finally, a show not about PC bs. It's a very well-rounded suspenseful tv series. Every minute of each episode I'm intrigued to see what happens next. Very well written. I honestly can't think of one bad thing about it. It's definitely the first tv series in a long time where I couldn't wait til I got to watch the next episode. So much excitement. I highly recommend even if you're someone not into science fiction. I can't wait for season 2!!! Oh and the intro credits music is fking awesome!",figurative
"Some people need to grow up A lot of reviews on this show are rated low for the simple reason that Aggie is a lesbian. That fact is in no way central to this story other than character development. What difference does it make?? It is not being ""rammed down your throat"" in this instance, sometimes yes, I agree.

Someone said, ""why does she have to be lesbian?"" Well why does she have to be straight? Lesbians do exist, whether you like it or not. Grow up people.",figurative
"Season One Turned out excellent. For gamers especially, and for non-gamers alike. It has everything and does everything right. Action, drama, sci-fi, adventure, survival, war, post apocalypse, gritty stuff, serious stuff, heavy stuff, and comedical, satirical stuff that is quite clever. In a way mocks the real world, while the real world (too)often makes a mockery of itself..

All in all, great show, great watch, combines fun and intrigue, highly entertaining, while gloomily, almost depressingly real in some aspects, while those familiarized with the game franchise, will notice abundance of details in all their accuracy..",literal
"Not House Many have mentioned that this is a clone of House M. D. But but it's not. House was a d!ck... Watson is more of a caring and less blunt type person.

But yes, this is very formulaic and how they proceed to diagnose and investigate does give you House vides, along with another half dozen doctor shows over the years, including Trapper John, MD, Dr. Kildaire, Diagnosis Murder, and of course the king of this genre, Quincy MD.

The supporting casts are ok characters, but again, formulaic. Nothing stands out, nothing original.

It's an ok show, I'm a fan of Chestnut, but this show is just not doing anything different. Maybe that in of itself something many may like.... familiarity.",literal
"Not since Breaking Bad Have I enjoyed a series so much. I stumbled across this series on Netflix, and I watched season 1 yesterday and I'm watching season 2 today. The acting is superb, and, and I am already looking forward to season 3. I had never heard of any of these actors with the exception of A. Martinez, who has been in many things I've seen. All the actors are brilliant and believable because they are actually native Americans playing Native American parts. The scenery is beautiful and they show a lot of it. I can see I'm going to need to watch this again because it moves so fast that it's hard for me to keep up with it. Also, I'm not sure of all the character's names yet. I definitely recommend watching this series.",literal
A movie for the millennials This was honestly a lot better than I expected it to be. I went in with very low expectations and wanted to see it just for a shout out to my childhood but it was honestly hilarious. I was laughing almost the whole movie. Jamie Lee Curtis is so funny and the return of Chad Michael Murray as Jake. Love it. Go see this movie if you are from my generation. Trust me it's hilarious.,literal
"It's good to have smiling friends. After the first five minutes, it was clear that this would be a great show. The humor is spot on. Every character brings something to the episode. It made me laugh out loud. It was unexpected and uncontrollable. I can't risk taking a drink of water.",literal
"""She's Alive, ALIVE!"" Anthony Michael Hall, Ilan Mitchell-Smith, Kelly LeBrock, Bill Paxton, Robert Rusler and Robert Downey Jr. star in John Hughes' 1985 sci-fi comedy. Hall (Vacation) and Smith play nerdy, Chicago teens, Gary and Wyatt who decide to create the woman of their dreams via computer after being inspired by the horror classic, ""Frankenstein."" LeBrock (Hard to Kill) plays their beautiful, intelligent creation, Lisa who helps them gain confidence and popularity. Paxton (Titanic) plays Wyatt's bullying, older brother, Chet, Rusler (A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge) plays Max and Downey Jr. (Iron Man) plays his pal, Ian who like to humiliate them. This is a good 80's flick that's a little different from Hughes' previous films, ""Sixteen Candles"" and ""The Breakfast Club"" with a good cast & score. I recommend this.",literal
"Warm witty and poignant I loved this right from the outset. Being a fan of other shows created by Michael Shur I am pleased to say I find this another winner.

If you didn't know that this was based on a documentary you would be tempted to say the premise is not very believable. However, the whole thing is brilliantly set up by the writers and played out exceptionally by all the cast. Ted Danson once gain excels. Stephanie Beatriz is also exceptional playing a much more sympathetic and warm character than her standout turn in Brooklyn 99. The chemistry between Ted Danson and his two 'daughters' is a highlight

Although this is a comedy the storyline handles difficult subjects associated with growing old with great care and empathy. Tackling issues of loneliness, dementia, serious illness and death with great sensitivity while still injecting humour. It's not laugh out loud funny but it does make you smile and chuckle that is much more appropriate for getting its core messages across.

I recommend it.",literal
"Brilliantly acted The main interest of this series is the treatment of history and in this case rather old history, the war of Independence of the United States of America, from the English point of view, and then the French Revolution, with the Terror and Napoleon. This complete collection is quite explicit on these events, but it looks at them from one particular and rather biased post of observation.

First, we are in Cornwall, far away from London, and this Cornish reality is always present in its original characteristics, accent on top. This society is aristocratic but at the same time, there seem to be three types of social elite, maybe even four. At the top, the rich aristocratic families who have enormous and ancient halls, chateaus, mansions or castles, with servants and regular incomes from their land or other economic activities carried out on their estates. They do not work per se, I mean they do not have any sort of employment or salaried activities. They only manage the work of others, and some are members of the House of Lords, hereditary members.

The second layer is more local, more traditional. They do not really have titles and aristocratic links. They are just and mostly gentlemen from old families with old respected and revered old names. They do have activities and they own land, at times some nice mansions on that land. They also have mines and they exploit them. That's the basic pair of cousins at the beginning. Ross Poldark is the poor branch of the family and he has to work very hard to get an income and become someone recognized and respected in society. In fact, he is so marginal in this second tier of aristocracy that he is unable to really integrate social norms and manners. He goes as far as marrying his own kitchen maid, which is a sign of social senility for the establishment. The second cousin in this pair is Francis Poldark, the rich branch of the family. The young man married Ross's beloved Elizabeth while he was gone to fight in the American Revolution, meaning against it, but apart from good manners and a lot of vanity, he is unable to earn a decent living, he is gambling his own fortune away, he is unfaithful to the utmost. Elizabeth Chynoweth is the prize that will always stand between the two and when Francis dies by drowning because he had never learned how to swim, Ross is married to Demelza and Elizabeth is looking for a businesslike marriage and she finds it in the representative of the financial aristocracy, George Warleggan, a nearly self-made banker whose father was a miner or a smith of some sort.

And that's the third elite that targets to become aristocrats and accumulate power in their own hands, clean power or dirty power, economic, political, or simply shadowy power, and George Warleggan has only one objective in life: making money by buying everyone else out of business, only following his immediate short-term interest, hence rejecting everyone who cannot serve his interests, particularly the poor ragged miners or farmhands or servants. He never has one single thought about them and can fire them in a minute without any pangs of conscience, since he has no conscience anyway, causing the misery of hundreds of families.

The fourth elite is represented by the ""professions"" that are so important in England. Military and Navy officers, clergy, physician or doctors, lawyers were the main professions to which we could add University professors, dons and deans. In this case, they are all represented, plus one traditional and more ancient banker who is trying to practice honest banking as opposed to the speculative banking George Warleggan practices.

The rest of society is in rags, unheard of, unlistened to, rejected, looked down upon. This English society at the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th centuries was extremely selfish and feudal, still. It is the fight and struggle of the lower title-less aristocracy and the decent members of the professions who fight for an improvement of this society that little by little actually manage to get improvement, especially when the French Revolution is giving nightmares to the top aristocracy and to the King, the monarchy as a whole.

The main question that is shown and discussed or illustrated in this series is the role and position of women in this male-dominated society. All types of abusive men, husbands or not, are shown and described. All types of women trying to get some dignity, some freedom, some say in a society that does not recognize them as even human, are at times pathetic and poignant. Demelza Poldark is one. And she is really doing that, day after day. Caroline Penvenen-Enys is another one from the top aristocracy who marries a local doctor out of love and tries to impose a certain power of hers in difficult political and social situations. But you could name quite a few more, including among the servants, though not that many after all. The most interesting case is Kitty Despard, an ex-slave married to an English colonial politician who mixes his fight against slavery and his personal glory or vanity which brings him to the hanging gallows.

The last point of interest is how this English society is shifting from an old feudal hierarchical architecture to a more open construction and progressive change, though the impatience and brusque and brisk language of some only bring blockades against this change and the strengthening of the corrupt speculators who manipulate the monarchy and the aristocracy through money and luxury.

I regret though that the third season is too skimpy on the French project of invading England from the South West. It sounds really amateurish on the French side, and totally reckless on the side of the rich speculators involved in the slave trade and other practices that were at the time already vastly rejected by the English society, particularly the scholarly and aristocratic elites. The French general Jules Toussaint is absolutely unprofessional though he is supposed to have had some professional experience in the American War of Independence. I guess Napoleon sent him on this mission to get rid of him. I must also say that to bring 2,000 soldiers to Cornwall would not have been invisible though 2,000 soldiers would have been rather light to march onto London and take it. It is true Ross's operation in Quimper to liberate Doctor Dwight Enys from a revolutionary prison was also very sketchy and the French soldiers there were not very swift. This downplaying the French is slightly unrealistic. The blockade of the French Republic actually played in the hands, right and left, of Napoleon since it justified the emergence of a real military leader capable of reopening the European territory to the French.

So, this complete collection ends up with a few opening moments and promises for further episodes, but so far none is announced, at least to my knowledge. It is true it might become slightly repetitive with Napoleon, the very slow dismissing of feudalism in England, the fight of women who are still one century before the suffragettes, and the rejection of what is shown rather clearly in this society: you could be elected to the House of Commons with twenty-seven votes, and a rich banker could buy a borough and the MP position attached to this borough. England was very far from anything really close to democracy at the time. The French were in the process of conquering universal ballot - true enough only for men - but that was a lot more than what they had in England at the time.

"nice dark mystery It's 6 years after Conrad Harlow's conviction for FBI agent Emily Byrne (Stana Katic)'s disappearance and presumed murder. Her FBI husband Nick Durand has remarried to Alice and Emily's son Flynn has long forgotten her. Nick receives a late night call from Harlow which leads to Emily's rescue from her watery tomb. Harlow is released from prison as trial evidences are proved incorrect. Emily's original target, crime boss Robert Semerov, is found waiting in the morgue and she is implicated. Boston police detective Tommy Gibbs investigates her case as she goes on the run. Her brother Jack and father Warren are her main supporters as even Nick starts to disbelieve her.

This has a nice dark mood and compelling mysterious premise. I like the first couple of episodes but the show bogs down into a convoluted reveal. If her past is the main reveal, then it needs to be presented right at the beginning. The way to do it are flashbacks to her childhood as the B-story. A younger Emily would allow a back and forth to the present day story. It would give better preparation for the ultimate reveal. The acting is relative good although I don't remember the villains. Without the preparation, the revelations don't hit as hard and the reveal lacks real shock. This is fine but it could have been better.

EDIT: I did not expect a second season. Two starts with an attack on the federal government. Emily returns to work and tries to reconnect with her son. This season suffers from a similar situation as the first season. It starts one way and finishes another way. This one starts like it wants Emily to be in a police procedural. I really like her new relationship with her son. When her mother shows up, it would have been a great family drama. I don't really love it but I can see it working. Then it takes twists which loops back to the first season. Instead of the twists, it should be simply Emily alone investigating her case without the extra layer of investigation. This show often gets too muddled for its own good. At least, it ends in a good place.",literal
"Hilarious and Eye-Opening Eddington (2025) - Ari Aster

Wow! Where do I even begin?

When scrolling on Instagram a while ago, I saw a short reel of Ari Aster talking after this film premiered at the Cannes film festival. Once the applause died now, I believe his first words were ""sorry, I guess?"" I do not know the quote verbatim, but he jokingly apologized for the film. It is easy to see the need for an apology just an hour into the film. Eddington is riddled with politics, controversy, violence, and surprisingly, some of the best dark humor I have ever seen in cinema. We finally have a fictional movie that truly addresses tensions in America during the COVID-19 pandemic, and it is one hell of a movie.

Meet Joe Cross (Joaquin Phoenix), the sheriff of Eddington. He may not want to wear a mask everywhere he goes (and claims it is due to asthma), but that does not make him a bad person. Not yet, at least.

And meet the current mayor of Eddington, Ted Garcia (Pedro Pascal). He reminds Joe that there is a mandate in place to wear a mask in public, but at least he is polite about it while reminding Joe that it is just a safety precaution.

The first hour of the movie pokes fun at such behavior from both sides of the issue, which is a very bold thing to do only five years after the timeline in which this story takes place. But this is just a precursor to how tensions will quickly escalate from more serious issues, both political and personal, once the first act ends with Cross announcing his run for mayor of Eddington.

Now, while I would likely not agree with Cross' behavior towards COVID if I was back in 2020 when the movie takes place, Cross has noble, and understandable, qualities such as wanting to treat everybody more like human beings than like toddlers during uncertain times. Is he a conservative since he dismisses COVID? Well... who cares? It does not matter what side of the political spectrum he falls on, but the important thing is while some see him as selfish, to others he is a kind and caring human being.

At first.

One thing that the movie does very well is that while it brings up political divide and tensions which were happening in 2020, it attempts to remain unbiased, showing both the good stuff and the bad stuff coming from each ""side."" There is a lot of first amendment auditing in the movie, but before videos get posted to Instagram, it is shown in the movie that a lot of what actually makes it to the social media platform is taken completely out of context. Even minor subplots are filled with notions that certain biases definitely exist through manipulation of technology and the use of social media.

This review may not feel complete, but I think I have to stop myself here before I begin to spoil anything about the second half of the movie. But I will leave you all with this... I think Phoenix's performance is incredible in this film because there is a ""point of no return"" moment in which I decided that Joe Cross becomes one of the worst fictional human beings I have ever seen portrayed on film.

I am not going to say this movie will not offend you, because there is a great chance that it will, but I think this film needs to be seen. It is controversial and hilarious, and I also think it challenges me to think about the world and try to remain less biased and more understanding of opposing points of view.

Sure?! A classic romcom that I wasn't expecting much out of. This probably should have stayed a book. I didn't read the book so this was all new to me but I still enjoyed it. Mason Thames and McKenna Grace will be the new heartthrobs of all upcoming movies. But also Mr. Krabs is still finding ways to get rich. I just also love Dave Franco.,literal

"Different to its predecessors whilst still being a superb whodunit Rian Johnson has done it again with Wake Up Dead Man, another clever and satisfying whodunit that offers something different to its two predecessors. It feels like a fitting film for the moment by focusing on the hatred festering in closed off communities and the importance of letting it go in order to move on but it's still a really fun mystery as well. It'll benefit from repeat viewings and definitely plays well on the big screen, making its future on Netflix frustrating.

Josh O'Connor is this film's greatest asset. He gives a fantastic performance where he gets to be sensitive, funny and navigate his character's anger in an empathetic fashion. Daniel Craig only continues to be a hilarious highlight who feels very comfortable with the intelligence and heart of Benoit Blanc now that he's played the character three times. Together, they are a wonderful pairing who only get funnier and more lovable when playing off each other.

Everyone else in the star studded cast is great. Josh Brolin is initially unrecognisable as he quickly becomes a commanding presence and Glenn Close has a suitably unwavering commitment. Jeremy Renner, Andrew Scott and Daryl McCormack all know how to mine the pathetic nature of their characters for comedic effect. Cailee Spaeny and Thomas Haden Church are more sympathetic than the rest of the characteristically self-obsessed suspects here.

Rian Johnson's direction ensures this instalment has its own look and feel when compared to what came before thanks to some horror movie flourishes and a slightly darker tone. Steve Yedlin's dynamic cinematography also helps to make the film feel different and it generally looks a lot better than so many Netflix originals with graceful camerawork, striking lighting and a richer texture. Nathan Johnson's score effortlessly adapts to the new style too.",literal
"Bad, bad, bad The word ""cringe"" gets thrown around a lot; I hesitate to use it. Reviewing Shelby Oaks, though, it's warranted. From the main character leaving the blood of the man who shot himself in front of her on her face for half the film, to that same main character thinking she needs to do all of this jump scare infested investigating in the middle of the night, this movie is a testament to cliches and lack of self awareness. What's worse is that the relationship between these sisters is so half baked that not once did I belive their relationship. Chris, I expected more from you. Stick to youtube.",literal
"Nathan Fillion - Mal is BACK! But older and wiser than the stunning character he played in the perfect 10 Firefly. So, I am always honest in my ratings. I admit to adding two whole stars just to watch Nathan Fillion again in something a bit more serious and hard hitting than Castle. This is not a perfect show. But if you had to pick an actor to pull off a 40 something rookie in a police precinct, I'd START with Fillion and pray he'd take the role (which he did!).

To be fair, the multi race cast of The Rookie are also fantastic. Sometimes when I watch a show that ticks off all of Hollywood's boxes (not necessarily the VIEWERS boxes, however), I can't watch it because it CAN come off a bit preachy. But Nathan Fillion is the Fred Astaire of the acting profession. He could act with a cardboard box and it would be wonderful. He mixes in just the right amount of hubris, humility and humor to make you fall in love with his character, John Nolan.

However, all that being said, I must give a shout out to other fine actors who make up this ensemble cast, which despite Fillion's huge screen presence, also shine brightly in this show. Richard T. Jones plays Sargeant Wade Grey, a serious, skeptical but honorable head of the division the three rookies are in. In the beginning, he was sure Nolan would wash out within a week. As the episodes rolled on, a sort of mutual respect and friendship grows between them, a high five for BOTH actors for the ability to pull this off in such a slow, but very sweet fashion. The other two rookies and each of the three teaching partners are excellent in their roles and at times, even Fillion's story takes a second place to their stories.

Great scripts, great directing (the seams of the show never fray even though each episode has a different director), beautiful Southern California scenery, cinematography, and a storyline that keeps advancing without missing any steps along the way. Watching these relationships change and grow as the season has gone on, is a pleasure. We watch a lot of shows. But there are only three we pick the night after it's recorded - The Resident, Criminal Minds, and The Rookie. (I want to add Manifest as well, even though the season has ended and we still have no idea if it will be picked up again - PLEASE PICK IT UP AGAIN?).

With all of this, The Rookie still hasn't found its audience and the ratings are not as high as they should be. But I keep thinking back on NCIS - and even Criminal Minds - neither a blockbuster the first season. Back then, the producers and networks took a chance on a highly rated show as The Rookie, which currently is at 8.0 on IMDb's own rating system. The only thing I am wondering about is, what happens to the name of the show when he graduates to a full fledged police officer and is no longer a rookie? My sense is HE will be given a rookie to raise if it gets renewed (which I hope it does!).

I am so sick of these networks dropping some of their greatest shows. Shows like Travelers (on Netflix - one of the best sci fi shows ever and idiot Netflix cancelled it after 3 seasons. WATCH IT!), The Pretender, Journeyman, Moonlight, Forever, Threshold, Intelligence, Frequency, AND FIREFLY, and so many others cancelled after the first season with ratings at 7 plus in IMDb! I am SO hoping these people who have broken my heart too many times to count will take a chance and renew The Rookie. There are now at least FOUR knock offs of This Is Us that are getting renewed with similar ratings. The Rookie is as good as a TV show gets and deserves another season! Of course, if more people would WATCH it, and not discover it in Netflix five years down the line (like I did with Firefly), then it would be renewed. So spread the word while we still have a chance. Highly recommended! A gem of a show that just needs a chance to grow!",figurative
"Copycat humor, trying to be like The Office Every character is contrived and modeled after The Office. After the first episode, I felt like this was sure to be a bomb. Maybe u will be wrong over time? Let's hope. But I would have a really hard time time to watch this every week. Binge watching would be impossible.

I still have to come up with 300 more characters but I don't have much more to say. So many lines in the show were delivered directly at the camera expecting a laugh or some satisfactory acknowledgment. (Eg ""She's Donna!""). But each time, the delivery and words fell flat. I found myself groaning aloud. Wah wha. Hard pass on the show for me.",literal
"Blah I really wanted to like this but it just wasn't nearly as good as the first. I think they could've gone in many many different directions following the end of the original, but for some reason this one just didn't hit.

"Cavill Crown is safe Being a massive fan of both Henry Cavill and James Gunn I wondered who would win out, Synder's Man of Steel or Gunn's Superman. For me Synder still has it, and by quite a long way. Man of Steel has a purity to the essence of Superman, of restrain of character despite having overwhelming power. Gunn's version is good but it's a little too slapstick when compared to Synder's gritty hero tale. This new attempt at Superman simply blurs into insignificance with the other superhero characters that have been a let down since Endgame concluded. A drunk Supergirl and a unruly Superdog seal this films fate.

Henry, you're still the man!",literal
"Boring Well the first 2 were excellent and kept you guessing. Unfortunately Hollywood has this new thing and almost every movie is based on it since This one president who is now also producing movies is involved Who would ever think that the liberal left would go as far as firing themselves. Wow it doesn't take a rocket scientist like Elon Musk to see this. Even dummies like the rest of us can see the crazy plot of every movie is concerning the same thing.

When you give something to someone they won't care about it because they didn't work for it.

Hollywood should know this seeing such a frantic attempt not to be the 99 percent who don't work in the actors guild.

Shame too tunnel vision kills everything .even though it is supposed to be for everyone .

Unfortunately, it is not for everyone it is for the few.

Maybe we should go back to cowboys and Indians because they was exciting. Especially since the Indians had better guns because they had more money than the Calgary. The real truth about history.

Wonder who else had better stuff than others in the old days ?",figurative
"These low reviews are ridiculous This show is really good if you want some solid belly laughs. No show is perfect, but they've done an amazing job so far and the cast is very strong. Anyone giving this low reviews is completely off their rocker! People are saying the documentary format is overdone, except there hasn't been a good show to do this in many years. It makes you feel all the feelings and isn't just some cheap comedy (like ""Night Court"", which is unwatchable and comes on right after it). I highly recommend this show and hope that we end up with many seasons of it, there's not a single member of the cast that I don't really like!",figurative
"Uninspired, uninteresting, unfunny...but pretty. Interesting concept and good designs, but some of the most stilted, ham-fisted, cringy writing I've ever seen. Nothing here that hasn't been done before and done much better. The greatest sin (pun intended) it commits is that there's so much potential just wasted with clumsy exposition and info-dumping. Keith David does his best but even the greatest cast can only do so much with awkward drivel. It's also plagued with inconsistencies and ""wtf"" plot reveals that seem so out of place it's jarring. The dime store edgelord characters belong in the '90s, and while that's not a bad thing, if that's all you got going for you, I'll just comfort watch more classic guilty pleasures like The Crow, The Prophecy, or even Preacher. Maybe it will live up to its potential one day, like many shows that had rocky starts. I really hope so.",figurative
"Not sure I'll make it past the second episode Laura Linney is a great actress so I was excited about this show. Alas...

The first sign that this was not going to be a good show was the ""pretty woman married to much less attracted overweight guy"" premise. What's more is that there's no chemistry between the couple. There's also no character development, but people just suddenly change for one reason or another. And that's only the first 2 episodes.

Linney's character finds out she has cancer but doesn't want to tell anyone. OK, that's difficult to do so I understand. However, in episode 2 she doesn't want her only son to go to soccer camp, much to the kid's annoyance so he goes anyway. Now, this is where she had to tell the kid she had cancer so we could keep on liking her and if this were real life so the kid would want to spend quality time with his mom, but she bloody does not tell anyone still! No, instead she takes her teenage son off the bus when he decides to go to camp anyway because he obviously has no reason not to go. That's just way too selfish and wrong so I already detest the character and don't want to keep watching this mess.",literal
"Entertaining but suspension of disbelief necessary If you've ever watched a Fast & Furious movie and know anything about cars then you'll be familiar with the feeling that you know what's going on on the screen is ridiculous but you're going to go with it anyway for the purposes of entertainment. This is a feeling that you'll also end up experiencing when watching Sisu. There are some solid, believable scenes and then there are some over the top, wholly improbable ones. The acting is fine and it's entertaining enough but you just have to accept that you're on a ride. I was hoping for a little more than writing oneself into a corner and using quasi-magic realism to get out of it. Still, I enjoyed the gory, grittiness of it! Worth a watch though - think Die Hard on the moors and without the smart quips.",literal
"Do not recommend I turned it off halfway through the second episode.

The casting is good, and the concept of the voiceover narration by the characters is fun, but I have two major complaints.

1: That the through line that the characters are generally more focused on their personal lives than their patients is insulting to actual hospital workers, who get far more than their share of disrespect in real life.

2: These negative characterizations are also unfair to the residents of central and eastern Oregon, as well as people who live in rural communities everywhere.

As a viewer, I was shocked by the network's promo for the show--which is debuting as I write this--by prematurely (at least). Alleging that the show is already a hit. In my opinion, it can't be cancelled soon enough.

Second to the residents of eastern Oregon, who are not.",literal
"I thought it was a decent take on ""kid camps"" Unless you've been living under a rock you know about these camps for kids. Whether it's wilderness retreats, bible camps or anything in between. Most of them are sick and twisted with cults. They may not start that way but they almost always end that way. Drugs, physical and sexual abuse play a roll along with straight up brainwashing as well. Sure Mae Martin took some creative license with this, as well she could since it's her show! I like that she decided to include the whole town. That NXIVM cult had neighborhoods. Scientology has an hold on many towns. Anyway, I think Martin did a good job, with her writing, storyline, her acting, the cast and the location. Hope there's a second season since I'm invested in several of the characters. All in all a decent show with the perfect episode and season length. I didn't get tired of it and it didn't constantly repeat itself trying to fill 10-12 hour long episodes. Left me with some questions I want resolved too. Seeing as it's a limited series I may have to live without resolution...and I'm okay with that.",literal
"Excellent series....hpe there will be more to come. Terrific story, great performances. Makes me wish Longmire was returning. Don't miss this one. Life on American reservations is beyond hard and yet they prevail with honor.",literal
Male actors sounded like Batman The storyline seems good but the acting destroyed this series. All the guys talked in this deep voice with over the top serious faces. They all seem like they were over-acting their parts. You don't see one smile the entire series so it's hard to believe.,literal
"Series came in like a lion and went out like a lamb I enjoyed this series very much for the first few season's. But somewhere around where her husband starts his writing, Just started seeing how self absorbed the main character is. Just started to annoy me. I know she is ill etc. But her character just worked my nerves where by the last few episodes I lost any feeling what so ever for her.

So that I didn't enjoy the last season at all. Too bad for me. The acting is good. and the character of Kathy sure wasn't that way at one point. I enjoyed it so much for the start that I felt cheated by the writing. Wonder if there was a change in the writers at some point? 

Not sure why. I must have some kind of selfishness issue myself.",literal
"Thad Castle Returns Just think of Thad Castle having left Blue Mountain State, got a job in the Army and then this film.

Is it Oscar worthy? No. Is it a good fun watch? Absolutely.",literal
"Wow, such pizazz and showy stuff, and such a thin veneer of a plot Now You See Me (2013)

The entire movie is about pulling wool over your eyes—as clever as you might be, you'll never figure out what's happening. So you just have to rush along for the ride. And quite a ride it is, filled with legerdemain and fireworks, sleights of hand and feats of prowess. People disappear and people get out of and into handcuffs with one frame of the movie camera. You want to look one way but the camera looks the other and wham, another surprise.

Yes, it's the movie the wins, without quite succeeding as a movie. It's like someone winning at a game by cheating. Impressive—not! And yet it seemed like fun for awhile.

There is quite the starry cast here, though two of the biggest stars have only a few minutes (literally) of screen time, sprinkled throughout the film. Michael Caine is shown as the money man behind the hiring of the four magicians in their sudden rise to the top. And Morgan Freeman is shown as the hunter of magic charlatans. (And no, there is no connection to Batman here.)

The four magicians are kind of a Dream Team pulled together in the first twenty minutes of the movie, and at first you think you'll see more of their individual acts, which are kind of fun. And different. One is a shyster on the streets, another a kind of trickster mind-reader hypnotist (played beautifully by Woody Harrelson), another a showy big production woman, and the fourth a wizard with cards. After they get together, however, it becomes a version of ""Oceans Eleven"" with magic thrown in. The big sham even starts in Las Vegas.

If all you want is pizazz, this movie is for you. It's nothing but! And it's quite well made technically and very fast paced. But if you want to get in on the tricks and be not only surprised but also held in suspense, there are too many easy twists and tricks of cinema illusionism at work. In fact, a key problem with magic in the movies is that you can't quite believe it because you can't trust the camera-work and editing. And there are certainly many tricks here that are only possible by splicing one piece of film to another—you know that seeing it on screen, and just have to say, ""It's a movie, it's okay.""

One final element is the convincing, hard-boiled detective, played by Mark Ruffalo. He seems to be the dependable thread a viewer can cling do amidst all the swirling and disarray. A necessary element. Never mind his Interpol sidekick from France, which is meant to add a love story to the whole brew. This movie isn't a mess. It's just a shame because it is so close to having the stuff of a great (entertaining) movie. Even so, though, it's quite entertaining. Quite.",literal
"xXx does not disappoint! If you want to see a crazy action film with amazing stunts and great visual effects, this is the film to see.

It's an 8/10 from me!",literal
"Now You See Me 3, Now You Don't""Care""? So I finally watched Now You See Me 3, and let's just say... the plot pulled a disappearing act on creativity. The story feels recycled just like a magic trick you've seen one too many times at a kid's birthday party. Honestly, it made Now You See Me 2 look like a masterpiece in comparison.

I did enjoy the cast reunion - Isla Fisher back in action was a pleasant surprise but beyond that, everything was just... plain. If you're going to make fans wait nearly a decade, at least give us something worth the wait, not a rerun in a new hat.

The only illusion here is thinking this sequel was worth the wait.",figurative
"Bland, Boring & Tonally All Over The Place From the writer-director of Past Lives comes a rom-com that intends to dissect the shallowness of modern dating scene yet fails to offer a story worth investing into despite the charming set of actors it had at its disposal. Bland, boring & tonally all over the place, Materialists doesn't know what it wants to be as evident in its inconsistent tone and is a definite misfire on most counts.

Written & directed by Celine Song, the story follows a love triangle that ensues between a young matchmaker, her ex-boyfriend & a millionaire she meets at one of her client's weddings. Song is in her element when illustrating the luxury-driven dating culture of New York City, the unrealistic standards people in dating pool have, and how even relationships aren't spared from capitalism.

There are hints of insight in those selected moments but it barely scratches the surface. And the love triangle storyline is just devoid of juice and is unable to keep things interesting. It is expertly shot for the most part but the pacing is poor, editing is a mess, and the characters always feel a bit distant. Dakota Johnson, Chris Evans & Pedro Pascal are wasted in their roles and even their chemistry is flat.

Overall, Materialists employs the tropes & conventions of a rom-com to deliver its commentary on present-day courtship but narrates it with such dullness that the interest is never sustained. Song attempts to juggle with too many ideas instead of streamlining & committing to ones that show most promise. And coz of that, the central plot suffers. In short, Song's sophomore effort doesn't live up to the hype.",literal
"Unlike the candied Hollywood version of werewolves, this European version is for adults I almost didn't watch this film as the English translation of the French title gave the impression of yet another Hollywood ""treatment"" of a fable or tale with a dark undertone that has been CGI'd, sanitized, desexualized (to avoid R rating), ridiculously agnostic of the Laws of Physics, with 2-dimensional, unempathetic ""protagonist stars"". This came out just as the the Twilight and TV series mania on vampires and werewolves became a teenage cultural trend. Hopefully, the this has ended with Teen Wolf with impossibly good looking people doing vicious things, who still both escape the Law, and are portrayed as having a ""humane"" side.

Thankfully, this production was the exception. It was original in that it was set, without anachronism that often plague US productions set in another era, in 17th Century Europe/France. In an era when prejudice was overt, and going out at night was at risk of highway robbery and cut-throats.

The characters were three-dimensional, with ""good"" and ""bad"", and in-between, and the plot was rich and original. I wouldn't let minor children watch it. The only ""gimmick"" that jarred was that the Native American companion of the protagonist displayed martial arts - unknown in the Americas at that time. However, Mark Decacsos' taciturn manner suited his role.

There were no obvious anachronisms in the sets, costumes or locales. (I remember one US production ""Dark Shadows"" had an 18th Century scene in Martinique disturbed by a sound of a jet overhead!)

Production wise, there was a blue cast, as many French productions have, and it was excellent - not so full of CGI that you almost wonder why even bother filming with live actors, but just hire actors to do the voice overs to animation. Solid French actors, and, finally, a script that gives Mark Decacsos a gravitas, despite his limited French ability, instead of the teen, martial-arts, bang and blast brain-dead movies in which he has since been typecast.

A solid 8.5, but I am bilingual in French. Maybe the English dubbed version wasn't as naturally flowing and believable as the original French one; that seems to cause some monolingual anglophones to assign a lower rate.",figurative
"Dumb, dumb, dumb I think I need to re-evaluate my friendships; I can't believe two unrelated pals recommended this nonsense.

Just a point or two, episodes 1 & 2:

-How on earth would the press have got onto an FBI-only op quick enough to be at the (right) hospital an hour-ish later?

-Given the above, how could Nick imagine he had any time to spare before telling Flynn about his mother to save Flynn from finding out the way he did?

-Too much realism to expect Nick would never be alone in a room with a maximum security inmate involved in his wife's abduction?

-Any particular reason Alice's character needed to be so close in age to Flynn?

-No one realized what an awful idea it was to have Alice present when a traumatized Emily came to see her son for the 1st time in 6 years?

-Neither Nick nor Alice could give Flynn 2 minutes of coaching about the importance of being gentle with fresh-out-of captivity/hospital nearly-drowned Emily?

-Six years with no haircut = longer hair than that. Without layers.

-A traumatized person who hasn't driven in 6 years would take their 1st spin @ the wheel in downtown Boston...'cause someone wants to see a pile-up? Dead pedestrian?

-I like the part where Alice sees an intruder on the edge of the property @ night...and takes the dog outside without so much as a flashlight, leaving Flynn alone in an unlocked house with who knows who lurking.

-""Emily makes me uncomfortable. She makes Flynn uncomfortable."" Alice

No kidding, Ms. Empathy? Guess what: Emily makes Emily uncomfortable.

The Pitt is the best show on TV!! I've watched every show since it has aired. Noah Wylie is amazing with his character! This is the best show I've seen since ER! He has grown into this role. He is an older Dr. Carter and he's amazing in this role as this character Dr. Robby. This show was absolutely made for him. No one else could be this Dr. Robby but Noah Wylie!! All the characters are awesome and bring their own story to the show. The writing is phenomenal and the whole production. The Pitt is outstanding!! I hope they are working on next season Noah Wylie absolutely deserves an Emmy!! I can't wait until the next episode!!!,literal
"Should be called ""Badlands"" only. This would have been a good monster vs monster movie if they simply took the Predator out of the movie and replaced with some other alien. The new Predator look nothing like the other clan members of the original movies, and has way more human qualities. Understandable that he was a weak clan member, but being dopey, scared, lied and cheated on is not exactly a predator.

Even if weaponry had no resemblance of the original predators.",literal
"Ridiculous scores I'm not sure what's worse, this awful Hollywood-ised treatment of the most important trial of the last century, or the (I assume) Americans reviewing it on this site as being ""too historical"" or ""too factual"".

All that displays is the ignorance of factual history that seems to beset a generation, who swallow the ""American"" narrative to most things.

This was an opportunity for a genuine examination of the events, given over to flag-hugging myth which bares only a passing resemblance to fact.

The US played a major part in WWII. This wasn't one of them.

Please watch the far superior original.",literal
"10 for Cavill as Geralt and 6 for everything else, so 8 I'll watch Henry as Geralt for the 3rd season but then that's it for me. I've never seen the main star not given what he wants to stay before. I mean Tom Cruise became the Executive Producer of MI and Top Gun, same for Ryan Reynolds and Deadpool. They should have just made Henry ahead of the project and let him make the decisions instead of losing him. Because I severely doubt the show will make it with Liam unless they go a younger version of Geralt I guess, then maybe it could hang for a season, but that's about it. Which is a shame because the production design wasn't bad. The casting choices were way too woke for my Slavic tastes but most did an adequate enough acting job perhaps. So basically Henry carried the entire thing.",literal

Stories to rival the imagination, but not be predictable.

Mike White always plays unique characters in his career and now he thinks them up in unique, but memorable ways. No outlandish or unbelievable story lines.

"Outstanding originality I loved how fresh and unconventional this movie is, from cinematography, plot, acting, to music and even costume design. It looks like an experimental indie movie with the budget and cast of a blockbuster. After this movie, I could not speak or even think clearly. My brain had just consumed so much novelty that it was still trying to adjust and make sense of it. This is what cinema was created for.",literal
"Love it so far. Familiar with the source material. I think the series overall is going to be called Dark Winds. This intro(first season) is loosely based on another book called The Listening Woman. It seems to be confusing some, as another book is called The Dark Wind. The acting is excellent. You have a lawman who straddles the fence between modern investigation and lore. You have another law person who will pull over and start rituals! Yet another knows the lore well, but so far disbelieves. It's not going to be Night Stalker set on an Indian Reservation if you think that's where it's going.",literal
"This series is worth the wait! THIS is what tv is supposed to be!! I've been spoiled by streaming and after the first two episodes dropped and now I have to wait a week I'm screaming! Excellent casting-I wasn't pulled out of the story by extreme/fakey actors. I'm already caring about characters story lines-character development and writing is on point. There was dramatic action within the first episode-so this will keep us on our toes. AND it is letting you peek behind the curtains of America's oil industry-learning about something I didn't know about is a plus! Only criticism is that the daughter's portrayal is cringe. She is supposed to be 17 but looked so old I googled her and she is TWENTY-SEVEN!! There are 10 thousand beautiful talented teen aged actresses to pick from. And what daughter would walk around in panties with her rear hanging out in front if her father AND his coworker roommate cronies like she doesn't know how gross that is and her dad never says a thing? Panty scenes twice, runs naked in shower scene AND drawn out (non-existent) bikini scene of a spoiled brat are all unnecessary and bring the quality of the show down and will turn alot of viewers off. Male writers and producers don't have to pander to the lowest denominator of your gender if the storyline and directing is on point! Otherwise loving it so far!",literal
"Great initially, let down by season 3 I previously rated the show an 8, but i have had to lower the rating after season 3. I loved season 1 and 2, but I'm just not enjoying season 3 as much. The main characters seem to have different personalities.

The show in season 1 and 2 was warm, engaging and funny, but a lot of that is lost in season 3 somehow.

I personally don't really like the musical theme of season 3, but others appear to love it.

The reveals are obvious and easily guessed at the beginning, and aren't very interesting/twists.

The writing seems way less serious, as though they know it's a stupid premise so haven't put as much effort into the writing.

Overall I am disappointed with season 3, the ending certainly wasn't worth dragging out 10 episodes for. Would love to see the show carry on, more similarly to season 1.",figurative

Gary is played by anthony michael hall and is his own fun dorky self along with wyett played by former child star ilan mitchell smith. I feel they have good chemistry together and get along wit lisa, their computer girfriend. The acting by kelly le brook could be better but she was pretty fun. And wyetts bully older brother chet is the late great bill paxton. Weird science is a fun and charming 80s classic that had me smiling throughout with a great cast and even better music.",literal
"I prefer the original IT film to this remake I love horror and I loved Stephen King's original IT film. I wanted to really love this movie, but I just wasn't feeling it. I think I watched 75% of it then got bored and never finished. (I'm watching this as a rental, though, so I may finish it tonight). It was a little bit different than the original...they added dialogue for the kids that was more ""current' so they brought up references to sex more...which in my opinion added nothing to the movie. There was more special effects and a bit more gore...I don't think these added anything to the movie either.

The clown didn't really scare me. I thought some of the scenes with the clown were just weird and over done. I'm disappointed. I'll give it a 6, though, because it wasn't an awful movie...it just didn't live up to my expectations.",literal
"Disnified Cute creatures, a band of unlikely traveling companions, and a villain turned hero. It didnt take long for Disney to ruin Predator.

"A Classic Christmas Comedy Christmas Vacation is one of the best Christmas comedies that I have seen. Now that it has been 20 years since it was released, I think it is safe to say it has attained classic status.

Christmas Vacation follows the Griswald family dealing with Christmas. Unlike the other vacation films the Griswalds don't travel anywhere. They have Christmas right at home. However just because they don't travel doesn't mean that it isn't a funny movie.

The film is about Clark Griswald (played by Chevy Chase who does his role perfectly) trying to create the perfect Christmas for his family. However much like the other films things constantly go wrong or don't succeed. As the film goes on the mishaps become worse and funnier by the second.

Christmas Vacation is a hilarious film that will have you laughing constantly. It is possibly the best of the Vacation films and is well worth watching.",literal
"Camp Royale I feel like people reviewing this with fewer stars just do not get it, which is fine. This is an over the top, campy AF twist on the ensemble dramedy series that has been all the rage in recent years. I get that camp is not for everyone, but I am still surprised by how low the rating is!

The story is good, and I think speaks beautifully to the experience of wanting to rise, to be accepted, and to belong. With deep layers! The characters, across the board, are delightful. I don't think there is a single character or acting I didn't appreciate in this show.

Kristin Wiig is straight up channeling Reese Witherspoon (somewhere between legally blonde and sweet home Alabama) and Josh Lucas was SO not what you expect of him, the combination was so funny. I would have never ever thought this role made sense for her but she was SO GOOD and I love how unexpected it was, out of the norm. Her mannerisms and facial expressions were spot on for the role and it was incredible to watch. Allison Janney is one of my all time favorites, and of course she was excellent here. But RICKY MARTIN 😂😂 I did not see him coming, totally did not expect to love him so much. HE WAS FANTASTIC. The aesthetics are beautiful, to top it all off - cinematography, color, sets, costumes - all of it is spectacular.",literal
"You will watch it more than once. Excellent, especially in today's world where you rarely find good movies. It will definitely be one of the best crime movies.

Go to the cinema now and enjoy Edge of Shadow, thank you Jackie Chan.",literal
"John Hughes can friggin entertain! John Hughes, the director who seemed obsessed with teenagers in the 80s, made some fine essential films like Sixteen Candles, Breakfast Club, Ferris Beuller's Day Off, and of course ""Weird Science"". Like many of his masterpieces, this tale is set in fictional Shermer, Illinois, which must be near Chicago. It starts out with two dorks (Ilan Mitchell-Smith and Anthony Michael Hall) who set out to become popular by creating their dream babe on the computer. Their idea is straight-forward: hanging out with a ""10"" will make them popular. Once they create Lisa (Kelley LeBrock), the hijinx begin and it does not appear that their plan will work. Until finally, everything does work out and they get the girls and live happily ever after. The reason I skipped the middle part is because it must be watched, and I am too damn lazy to go into it. Notable appearances come from Robert Downey Jr (Ian) and Bill Paxton (Chet).

The DVD is pretty good but lacks any features whatsoever. There are no subtitles, no trailer, nothing but the movie, but the movie is so good that the DVD is worth owning. This will bring you back to the days of ultra-hip skinny ties, feathered hair, and English Beat songs. I will give the movie a 9.5, and the DVD itself a 5. If you haven't seen this, at least rent it, or catch it on USA ""Up all night"".",literal

"It took me two episodes but I'm impressed. I almost bailed out during episode one, but I realized the producer/director needed to flesh-out the characters and their oppulant lifestyles before getting to the point, and now I'm glad I put down the remote. This eight-episode series is yet another example of the really great stuff Hulu has been putting out for the last five years (think back to ""The Queen's Gambit"").

Excellent casting choices, first of all. These characters are so real, so believable, and so immersive that, for me anyway, there were a few uncomfortable moments where I truly left my own life and stepped into theirs, the disturbing stuff and all. The excellent acting, cinematography, and musical scoring are almost emotionally magnetic, too. The directors, Jenner Furst and Julia Willoughby Nason, make sure you feel deeply-entrenched all along the process of this case. And it's an unsettling but addictive ride.

I've done some of my own research about this case (admittedly all online, so no more than the average ""armchair crime investigator""), and I admire the realistic and ""assumed"" script-writing with regard to accuracy. Of course liberties are taken, but let's be honest, the crimes are more interesting than the people commiting them, so there is zero chance that I'd watch this eight-hour story had the writers NOT added some spices.

Throw in some intriquging location shooting sites, really captivating scoring and Foley work, and some creative direction and lighting choices and this quickly became my latest Hulu binge.",literal

This show has just everything you want to have in a show like nice special effects, awesome story, very talented actors, good surpise moments and effects, incredible landscapes and so on.

I found every single episode very entertaining and thrilling, it's hard to stop it once you start watching it. If you like middle age series with fantasy elements, gore (it's very brutal) and a good story then you can not go wrong with this show.

The show has also the perfect length in my opinion, it is not too short but also not too long. For me definitely one of my top 10 shows of all time.",literal
"Simply too much Too many additions and changes to the basic premise create boredom, each episode is repetitive in the added chases and reasons why people are killing and being killed.

The setting is excellent and the acting is good, but the writers lost control after two or three episodes, it just gets too convoluted and at times, just silly.

One minute the locals are losing the fight and in danger of being beaten, the next all is fine and the situation is under control, over and over every episode, it gets monotonous.",literal
"9.2, seriously? The moment i start watching,this series stands at 9.2.

Anything exceeding a 9 communicates this show enters GOAT territory,or its massively inflated and strongly subjected to hype and fandom.so when i see scores like this after just 2 episodes, i always get a little bit suspicious.

Regardless,I embraced this show with an immaculate open spirit, only knowing Seehorn stars,whom i tremendously appreciate.

After 2 episodes in now, i can already confidently guarantee you,this is nothing anywhere close of deserving anything near a 9.

People judging this,after just 2 episodes,as brilliant or masterpiece, and rated it to the same category as TV milestones like the Sopranos, Band of brothers or The wire,is wild...very,very wild

Im sure lots of people are going to have fun with it, but this is objectively absolutely not next level television, elevated story telling or anything smashing never seen before groundbreaking stuff you would associate with such insane ratings.

Also subjectively,for me the humor absolutely didn't work. Its just way too many poor attempts for utter meh jokes falling flat, undermining decent story developing. The show create big mystery ,but narrative wise does very little with it, the focus lies entirely on other more trivial and superficial things,the poor jokes is just one of many.

People having fun with this, that i get, but i put money this show is never going to keep up a score above 9 I wish anyone enjoying this lots of fun for the rest of the ride, but im out!",figurative
"Main character being too MAIN CHARACTER Visually eyes pleasing. Songs are lit and catchy. The plot is very simple and very easy to follow, I believe this is targeted for teens.

I felt like the main character is being too self-centered the whole movie revolve around her. Every action and decision are made based on her. She is the ONE and the rest have no character development. The friendship felt flat.

There are so many K-Pop related references other than the voice of some of the characters. It just doesn't fit anyone who's in the K-Pop industry.

Rumi's HAIR is so UGLY. It's purple, extremely long, extremely bulky, it looked like one of the Viking's traditional hairstyle rather than Korean. The hairstyle surely is also the main character, cause I believe they wanted Rumi's to be the center of attention.",literal
"Seasons 1 & 2 are an 8. Season 3 more like a 5. Season 2 in Italy was overall the best one so far. Season 1 is right behind that. Season 3 was a downer and way too slooooow. It is not a coincidence season 1 was just 6 episodes and season 2 was 7 while boring, slow season 3 was 8! It really could have been just 6 episodes and it would have come across as more action packed and dramatic. The common thread across all three seasons so far is the superb acting and filmography. It does not matter where in the world this production crew goes, it will be an immersive experience for the viewer. As for season 4 coming up (location TBD), I hope they cut it down to 6 episodes and stay away from the overarching darkness of season 3. Yes, people died in each season but season 3 hits you differently and not in a good way at all.",literal

"Great Film Detailed By Gratuitous Gore I will start by saying David Jonsson deserves to be nominated for, if not outright win, an Academy Award for his performance in this film. It was nothing short of spectacular, and he was the emotional anchor for this powerful film.

I won't say much more about the movie other than that it squandered consideration for consideration as an all-time great film due to director Francis Lawrence's succumbing to the trendy schtick of pushing the limits to the depiction of realistic ultra-graphic gore. There was simply NO reason for many of the most shocking scenes, and they added nothing to the narrative. If anything, they detracted for the emotional impact the film could have otherwise had. There were scenes where I was just saying ""Why? Why did they need to show that?!"". I wish more directors today realized that leaving certain things to the imagination is just fine.",literal

She only approaches her boyfriend in a rude matter, with nasty passive agressive remarks. The story never explaines this. Really, she is not able to put together one decent sentence, and it makes you wonder are we dealing with a psychiatric patient who is supposed to be locked up for everybody's sake? The movie's second part, where she is mentally tortured, falls completelty flat. We are supposed to sympathize with her but that is impossible. The themes have all been done way better in many horror movies. I can't understand why this movie was made.",literal

"Dynamite Dud Really horrible ending. I was expecting so much and then blah. Come on. You had all these great actors and it felt like you didn't even bother to finish it because you were bored or something.

It was great up until the end too which made it so much worse. Why did you even bother with the story if you were going to just end it with a ""we ran out of time, let's just have them run toward a freaking hill."" Do better.",literal
"Very dull version of OZ First of all, how the director missed the most colourful film of the century?? World of Oz is supposed to be full of florescent colours, brightest shades of everything etc. What a waste or cheap work?

I loved Ariana Grande's character, on the other hand someone should zoom out the camera. It was hard to watch those crowded dance scenes in the emerald city. There are some major issues with the timeline of the story and cuts made by the director. We are wasting a giant part of the story yet this is only the FIRST chapter. Felt like we were watching 4th episode or something. I hope the second part will be better.",literal
"Trash Personally, if you're in the mood for a corny Christmas movie where the two leads always fall in love within a short amount of time and in time for Christmas, then this is your movie. If not, and you have a finer taste for movies, then stray away. This movie, in a sick sense, glorifies the idea of cheating in a relationship where one person is deeply in love with the other. To be honest, I despised the movie and every character in it. Crap  movie, do not recommend. 🤢",literal
"A Lot of Disbelief Must Be Suspended on This One There is a spiritual premise underlying this movie. Ultimately, it is Christian in nature. We know this in part because Edward Randolph refers to Jesus at one point in the movie, and in part because it is based on a book by Lloyd C. Douglas, who was a devout Christian. But it is more than that, because whereas everyone knows about Christianity, the particular spiritual principle in this movie seems to be known only to a few, as if there were a secret society. Why it is a secret is not explained, which is hard to understand, because if more people knew about it and applied that knowledge, the world would be a much better place.

The secret principle is karmic in nature, and is explained by analogy with electricity. The way it works is that if you do good things for people without letting other people know about it, and you refuse any attempt on their part to repay the debt, you build up a spiritual charge of good karma that rewards you. If you allow them to repay the debt, the spiritual force is discharged. Most people are grounded, never accumulating a charge, because they allow people to return the favor. If you tell other people about your kindness or charity, the spiritual force will dissipate, as with a wire without insulation. This need to keep one's good deeds a secret is to be distinguished from the secrecy surrounding the principle itself. Even if you accept the former, that still does not explain the latter.

The story begins when the reckless behavior of the rich, irresponsible playboy Bob Merrick inadvertently causes the death of Dr. Wayne Phillips, who we later find out was the one who initiated Randolph into the secret spiritual principle. Dr. Phillips was such a good man that he used up all his income and borrowed against all his assets to do good deeds, leaving his wife, Helen, and his daughter, Joyce, nothing. Merrick tries to make amends, but Helen is insulted by his efforts to use mere money to atone for the death of her husband. Later, Merrick learns about the karmic principle from Randolph, but he is a bit crude in his attempt to put it to good use. He helps someone out who needs money, and then, figuring he is all charged up with a lot of good karma, tries to make a dinner date with Helen, whom he now has the hots for, even though she is a widow of only a few weeks. In trying to get away from his persistent advances, she is struck by an automobile and blinded. Thoroughly chastened, Merrick decides to go back to medical school, becomes a doctor, and then has to perform an emergency operation on Helen, which saves her life and restores her vision, allowing them to marry and live happily ever after.

If the spiritual metaphysics of this movie is just too incredible to suspend disbelief, it becomes an outrageous melodrama of coincidence. Furthermore, we are appalled that Dr. Phillips did not provide for his wife and daughter in the event of his death. We get the sense of a man who was so caught up in the idea of helping strangers that he neglected his family. But given what he believed in, I guess he figured his spiritual estate would take care of them, on the assumption that good karma can be inherited.

In any event, even an atheist can understand that helping out one's fellow man can be rewarding, that one is paid back, in a way, for one's kindness and charity. And thus, the movie can be accepted allegorically and enjoyed as a good tearjerker.",literal
"Stabler and Benson The focal point of the series has always been the detective team of Elliot Stabler and Olivia Benson. They work in the special victims unit aka the sex crimes unit of the NYPD, also in the unit are John Munch(who alter on becomes a Sergeant), Odafin Tutuola and Captain Cragen. The show covers pretty every angle of sex crimes and child abuse, really bringing the stories home. IMO this is the best of all the L&O series, none of the rest of the L&O series really let you know the main characters as well as SVU does. In the main L&O show you don't really learn all that much out about the detectives outside of what they do for a living.",literal
"Much Better w/o Dawson I am currently watching Season 8 after bingeing the past 7, and I must say, the series is more palatable w/o Dawson. At first I was a cheerleader for her and Casey, but that quickly turned ""womp womp"" after seasons (and seasons) of her ""all about me"" story lines. It was just too much! I have thoroughly enjoyed Seasons 7 and now 8. I enjoy most of the character arcs and supplemental storylines as well. I love bingeing, but I may watch some of the upcoming season episodes live just to get a sense of the direction.",literal
"""Get woke, watch rating tank, reconfigure in Season 4' I got into The Rookie a couple of years late, so I binged Season 1 and Season 2. I liked the show. It's not as good as ""Southland"", but it was a nice, inoffensive, standard LAPD drama, with the charm of Nathan Fillion carrying the show.

Oh but then Season 3 hit. The show became a preachy, boring, heavy-handed wokefest. The writers treated every white character, ESPECIALLY Officer Nolan, as racists or idiots. It was a nonstop browbeating for the entire season. And the ratings plummeted.

Imagine my surprise when Season 4 started, and there was no more Titus Makin, Jr. In the cast. Imagine my surprise when the entire ""Nolan goes to law school night classes and gets browbeaten about white privilege"" storyline is just gone. Not a mention of it. No, now Nolan wants to be a TO, and not a detective. The first two episodes have been an action movie rescue plan to get Lopez from La Fiera, and a Tricia Helfer as a hottie master thief in tight outfits plotline.

The fanbase hated Season 3. Now the showrunners are trying desperately to save the show so they can get through Season 5 and get into syndication.

Pretty Good movie I watched this movie New Year's Eve with my friends and they loved the movie when they saw it in theaters and I thought that I should watch it and is was pretty Good. Ariana Grande did much better than I expected and Cynthia was phenomenal. Defying gravity and popular was my favorite songs from this musical. I don't watch many musical but this one was pretty Good. I loved all the different colors and characters. My one thing about this movie that I didn't really like was how long is was. It just seemed like the movie went on and on. But I get it they had to fit a whole first act into a movie and it paid off for them.,literal
"Refreshingly Different. Ok, before I forget, this had a great soundtrack.

The drama reminded me of the Australian Mystery Road productions.

It had the same sort of premise, set within indigenous people's tribes, et al. This is et in New Mexico on a Navajo reservation.

Dark Winds is an American psychological thriller television series created by Graham Roland based on the Leaphorn & Chee novel series by Tony Hillerman. It premiered in June, 2022, with the first season consisting of six episodes. After its premiere, the series was renewed for a six-episode second season, which premiered in July 2023. In September 2023, the series was renewed for a third season.

The series follows two Navajo police officers, Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee, in the 1970s Southwest. The first season is primarily based on Listening Woman (1978) and elements of People of Darkness (1980). The second season adapts People of Darkness.

If I am going to be critical there were too many shoot outs with too many bullets (thousands) missing any targets.

The second series featured two apparently indestructible men with a refence to another one who apparently walked away from the end of season one, despite being shot and blown up.

Also, wounds kept disappearing and then reappearing in later scenes.",literal
"Chaotic and challenging If I Had Legs I'd Kick You feels like it could be the breakaway hit of Sundance 2025. As with many of the films at the festival, I sat in on a press screening not knowing much about the movie beyond the brief blurb in the program. I chatted with the person seated next to me about the films we had seen and how we had both heard some good buzz about this film. The lights dimmed, and the first thing that appeared on the screen was the A24 logo. We immediately turned to each other, and expressed a mutual ""Ahh!"". Sure, they're behind a few clunkers, but in general, when I see that A24 is behind a project, I perk up. Their films are just plain different.

Writer and Director Mary Bronstein has presented a challenging portrayal of motherhood that is uncomfortable to watch. Shot almost entirely in close-ups, the atmosphere is claustrophobic, frenetic, and oppressive, with no lingering establishing shots to allow the viewer to orient themselves. We are forced into Linda's personal space, feeling almost like we're invading her privacy: the camera is focused on Linda in almost every shot. If I Had Legs I'd Kick You is about challenging the audience to confront truths about motherhood, guilt, and the emotional divide between cultural expectations and personal reality. Imagine Nightbitch, but without the quirkiness.

The plot centers around Linda (Rose Byrne), a psychotherapist trying to balance her job with her 10 year old, nameless daughter who suffers from some sort of unnamed illness that demands she receive constant care and attention. The daughter is faceless throughout the film and connected to a feeding tube, the umbilical cord that Linda desperately wants to sever. The focus here isn't on the illness itself, but on Linda's emotional and physical exhaustion, and her growing resentment. Similar to the disturbing We Need to Talk About Kevin (2011), the film explores the taboo subject of a mom who has never bonded with her child. Here, Linda is self-medicating with drugs and alcohol and making other questionable choices, all the while trying to counsel other people.

If I Had Legs I'd Kick You is a film of metaphors and layers of emotional nuance. Early in the movie, Linda experiences a flood in her apartment that leaves a huge hole in the ceiling, forcing her to move into a cheap motel nearby. Despite her efforts to coordinate repairs, the hole simply isn't getting fixed. A recurring theme is Linda needing help and not getting any, and this huge hole in her life is just getting bigger. She keeps returning to the apartment, only to discover that no work has been done on the hole.

The movie also explores the theme of being ""seen"". Linda's interactions with others, including her therapist (a chillingly detached Conan O'Brien), reflect her frustration with being unable to find the support she needs, despite her constant pleas for help. Her husband is a ship's captain, off at sea, and offers no support. He can't understand why Linda isn't getting the ceiling fixed. The most grounded character in the film is her motel neighbor James (A$AP Rocky) who literally calls her out for being a neglectful mom. I guess he's the only person who does actually ""see"" her in the way we, as an audience do. James's confrontations with Linda are in stark contrast to the others who largely ignore or misunderstand her struggles.

It's difficult to convey the chaotic energy in this movie and the sense of being out of control. What if you don't feel the love towards your own offspring the way you are expected to? If I Had Legs I'd Kick You is a film that tackles motherhood head on and offers no easy conclusions. It's an exhausting experience and I loved it. It's only January, but I'm sure this will be in my top ten list in December.",literal
"good binge show Novelist Aggie Wiggs (Claire Danes) has writer's block and struggles with the lost of her son. The arrogant land developer Nile Jarvis (Matthew Rhys) moves in next door. He needs her to sign off on an easement. It's the start of the murder mystery chaos.

I love the start and these two great lead actors. I was expecting a ""did he/did he not"" murder mystery. That's not quite what this is. I don't love every element of this limited series. I don't need Shelley although I don't hate that part. I question a couple of turns. I don't see Benitez saying yes. It doesn't serve her agenda. She needs dirt on the thugs or she needs to double down. There are better ways to play those cards. I still don't understand why Brian Abbott would pull his gun on Nile Jarvis. He can't arrest him at that point. He could be emotionally reckless, but he's probably better to connect with Benitez. As with a lot of these shows, the characters never share enough information. None of this is egregious, but they do hold back the show. Some of this is a little slower than I hoped. Maybe it should be squeezed down to six episodes. Quite frankly, I fast-forwarded the seventh episode. Nevertheless, it is still very engaging and a good binge show.",figurative
"Political incorrectness gone mad One of the earliest and certainly one of the most lavish of the British sex comedies that were to proliferate over the following decade, and typical of its time in the lampooning of Victorian double standards, a period then regarded as the ultimate in repression, prudery and hypocrisy. Today's audiences, reputedly as eager to take offence as any Victorian maiden aunt will no doubt find much of the content fairly deplorable, including a white actor 'yellowed-up' as a Chinese delegate. Though you don't have to be a censorious millennial to feel uneasy at some of the material, the jokes about rape and the flippant attitude to young girls in brothels, not to mention a particularly crass piece of innuendo in a song from a little girl, especially in the light of what we now know about the likes of Jimmy Savile and co at the time. David Hemmings stars in a dual role but struggles to convince in either. Despite all this Denis Norden's script does conjure up its share of amusing moments and it is fun spotting the numerous well-known actors and celebrities of the time popping up in cameo roles.",literal
"Nothing Original Here I am stunned that people can sit through this show. Particularly as a Jewish woman I find it completely unwatchable. None of the female Jewish characters - I should say ""caricatures"" - are likable or relatable. And the trope of the fabulous Jewish man who just can't stomach any of the domineering, ball-busting Jewish women is an old and offensive trope. This is lazy writing of old stereotypes and over-done ideas. Nothing here is new or fresh. I am trying to not call it what it is, but I will say this: I don't think anyone would dream of making this story about an African American man who chooses a white woman over all the fabulous Black women in his life. So why then is this okay?",literal
"A Charming Throwback Worth Keeping Around If you're looking for a fast-paced, slick, hyper-modern drama packed with endless twists and a heavy dose of ""woke,"" Murder in a Small Town probably isn't for you. And that's exactly why I love it. This show is refreshingly old-school-simple, straightforward storytelling with heart, atmosphere, and just the right amount of mystery. It's the kind of show that doesn't try to impress with gimmicks but instead leans into the comfort of a classic whodunit. My family and I have really enjoyed having something calm, grounded, and entertaining to watch together. If it's not your cup of tea, that's okay. But instead of knocking it just because it isn't your style, maybe let those who appreciate this kind of show have a little space to enjoy it. I'd love to see this one stick around-scripted TV needs more room for variety, not just what's trendy.",literal

"Its not just a videogame adaptation When I saw the title, I thought it was going to be just another mediocre video game adaptation for the small screen. As a fan of the video game series, I started watching it with the sole hope of finding references to the game. But when I got fully immersed in the episodes, I realized that not only is it a great homage to video games, with those references that fans love so much, but it's also a fun, well-told story, with characters you'll fall in love with and engage with. So, I felt that it wasn't just a good adaptation of the video game, but a good series in its own right. Even if you'd never played Fallout, you'd love this series. The characters are original, each with a well-defined personality, the scenes are frenetic. I love that each scene has a totally unexpected twist; the crazy, unbridled nature of video games is perfectly captured. It's truly a series worth watching even if you're not a fan of the series; I highly recommend it.",literal
"Season 1 is 8 stars, season 2 is 5 Season 1 had a good, interesting, story line, that grabbed you from the beginning. Kept you watching esp in anticipation on what will happen in the rivalry between the 2 female leads. But they suddenly coming together in end in that show of woman solidarity was more depressing cop out, enough to drop the season from a 9 to an 8.

Unfortunately, it seems they had no idea of what follow up story to tell in season 2, other than just showing a bunch of rich media people being ambitious, competitive, nasty, and neurotic. The Witherspoon character's particularly irritating, and she's spent half the season shouting at people. Crudup is best, he's held the series together. And the Carrel character's an interesting watch. As the guy who's fell off the mountain top...and, alas, has to console himself with the millions he's made. (And Carrel even has a resemblance to Matt Lauer)",literal
"Watch it for the first 10 seasons I can't believe it's taken me ages and ages to post a review of Law & Order (which technically should be titled Order & Law because it's the police in the first half, and the courts in the second half - in fact, a Friends episode I think made a humorous aside about this).

For me, it's the first 10 seasons which are the most solid, compelling and worthy of one's time. Sure, the seasons beyond are okay (even Michael Imperioli makes an appearance in five episodes) but the first 10 seasons set the foundation for the quality of the series and even the spin-offs, including the British one that was compelling.",literal
"I am completely hooked I didn't expect to like this show as much as I do. The whole corky-retro-dry-humor-thing has been done so many times before. But the story drew me in within a couple episodes. It's mysterious and thrilling, unpredictable and full of nuance. All of the actors are incredible. I love how their faces change so subtly while in the elevator. When I started watching it I thought I'd be able to watch every episode because every show has eight episodes these days (which I hate) but no, thankfully, there's more to come. The ninth episode appears to be one of the best ones, and now I have to wait a week to see it.

I don't understand how others would find it boring or slow. It is suspenseful in its own creative way. I'm so happy I decided to watch this. It's easily in my top favorite shows list. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes shows such as Black Mirror or any other psychological scifi.",literal
"Now You See Me isn't the worst, but it isn't the best! I went to the cinema last week. I was undecided but I opted for choosing ""Masters of Illusion"" or ""Now You See Me"". We look at your poster and title, we denote the illusion that there could be around the movie and noticed even the fantastic cast. Liked of power greet one thing. I went to the cinema through the coupon of newspaper Sol, what is of praising, discounting three Eros. Think this yes is benefit the seventh art, the reading and the easy access of spectators a movie.

The film was not a disillusionment. It wasn't exactly the best movie that I saw, but I think that earned the ticket. Despite a history slightly weak, had each good dialogues and some enthusiasm, and some attention in their characters. The film speaks us of a group of four illusionists each with your specialty since hypnotism, hands savvy, magic with objects and surprising tricks of evolution of technology. Found themselves due to a superior strength and magical (that after revealed-if be more surprising and Funny), that the joined, forming the Four Horsemen. So far, nothing mysterious, just a beginning of film to know the characters, so one filled to go to the main story. After make a fantastic bank robbery Créditique Republicaine of Paris, that maybe if reveal a simple magic trick. How is obvious, the FBI needs make your own research to ascertain how can the assault have occurred in Paris if were in Las Vegas.

The film was very Soft Spot in the its history base, but perhaps had a good development. It smells the Oceans's Eleven, but with more skepticism and mysticism, and it is clear that this film surprising when we know the true nature of the tricks. The essence of film is what has to best: their tricks, their premonitions, and the background of history similar to of Robin Hood, only with more secret and enigmas. The dialogues showed become quite good and epics.

The cast shone without major excesses, but were glitzy as illusionists. With guy of who knows trick, but not wants tell. Loved the character Woody Harrelson, the comic side of the film, and the character Morgan Freeman, the destructive side of the mystery we really want to know, but we were disappointed after he destroy the fantasy that is the trick.

Ed Solomon, Boaz Yakin and Edward Ricourt were writers of this argument, and Louis Leterrier was the filmmaker. Changed of a register sci-fi and fanciful for a movie with new meanings and full of illusion. Several are the ideas that come of the film. We begin by having faith in what feel and then we let ourselves fantasize by little fantasy that still exists in the world. E we still have let people from stealing at those corrupt rich to give to poor and worthy.

Think one sentence of film is very characteristic than is the world of magic and illusion. ""Closer you look, less you actually see."" Or ""Closer you try see, least certainly shalt see."" Try having curiosity and try to discover the illusion, which then end dead, like the cat.

You go see, but not wait a movie astonishing.

WORST: The weak arguments, filled with pieces of pudding.",literal
"Great baseball movie or great kid's movie: you decide This film proved to be one of the few kid-based stories which I still watch today. Films about growing up always make me misty, simply because of the moments of innocence which most seek to display. One of the funniest moments in film history is the guys using chew for the first time, then proceeding to through up on themselves and everyone else. Sure, it was a bit crass, but that's what happens when one tries chew for the first time. I especially loved the attitudes of the players, all defining themselves in some shape or fashion, modeling themselves after the common baseball player. Great fun, and the cameo performance with James Earl Jones was awesome.",literal
"It feels like turning pages of a great thriller! I started watching the series without any expectations, and only because the storyline is one of my favorites: psychological and criminal. The series is magnificent from every angle, the best I've seen this year, and let me tell you, I watch a lot!

I don't know the two main actors, with the roles of Angie and Nile in the series, but I never compare it to other shows because each actor wears a different wig in every role they play, that's why they are called actors.

All the actors are simply magnificent and the tension grows as the series progresses; I didn't find it predictable at all, on the contrary, there is a lot of edge of your sofa situations and unexpected twists.

If you like crime thrillers then this one won't dissapoint you.

It is an artistic thriller!

Creepy, tense, unsettling, and just a great psychological masterpiece.",figurative
"Good, but too short Chad Powers (2025-) is a sports comedy show on Hulu that was co-created by Glen Powell and Michael Waldron that follows a college football quarterback as he disguises himself to join the floundering football team at a small school. Now I was excited for this show given the people who created it and the show is pretty good.

Positives for Chad Powers (2025-): I like the premise of the show so far and it is done very well with the comedy that makes the situation believable enough to suspend your disbelief. The cast does a great job with their performances including Glen Powell, Perry Mattfeld, Quentin Plair, Wynn Everett, Frankie Rodriguez and Steve Zahn. The show is obviously carried by Glen Powell, who just has this charm to him that makes the audience love him even if his character isn't the best person. I really enjoyed his dynamic with the other characters as they learn how to be a team and help each other become better people. The comedy is great which is something I didn't expect to see from Michael Waldron given his previous shows, but it works for me. And finally, I can see this show get better with future seasons.

Negatives for Chad Powers (2025-): This first season was too short at only 6 episodes and it felt rushed. I also felt the the characters weren't developed enough aside from Glen Powell and Perry Mattfeld. And finally, the emotional moments between the characters weren't very satisfying for me.

Overall, Chad Powers (2025-) is a great sports comedy show with some missteps that I hope get improved with future season, but I still liked it for a first season.",literal
"Started strong The first season with Jeffrey Dahmer was fantastic. It followed the actual life and crimes of Jeffrey Dahmer. This latest installment is a fantastical view with a lot of assumptions about the case. I feel like most true crime people that like to watch these types of shows are looking for facts and things that happened and this was not that. It was a theatrical view of Ed Gein. Actual crimes were only a very, very, very small portion of the show. The majority of the show was the Alfred Hitchcock movie that came from it.

"Repetitive Last Samurai Standing was good until the sixth episode. Then it just became repetitive and boring. And there was no conclusion. There is not enough story here to justify a second season.

"Frustrating, but that's the point. A House of Dynamite starts off by teasing the viewer that they're about to get a modern day Tom Clancy thriller. An unknown force has launched an ICBM against the US and it's up to a fairly stereotypical cast of government/military actors to untangle the mystery and keep America safe. But as things continue we start to suspect that this film has ideas other than ""superior people and technology saves the day"" .

The main conceit of the movie is that at a critical point in the story it suddenly restarts back to the beginning of the crisis, showing it us again from the view point of different characters. Whilst another film might use that tactic to build up our understanding of the situation, A House of Dynamite uses it to escalate our horror over the seemingly lack of understanding. No one really seems to know what to do, or even how to handle the situation emotionally.

The President laments that he's been given more briefings on how to replace a supreme court judge than responding to a nuclear attack. The US's response is hindered by the same sort of everyday logistical problems as faced by a project manager trying to get 10 different people to join a Teams call. But more worrying, all the key figures seems to be more preoccupied with what will happen to their families than doing their jobs - which one of them quite literally 'dropping out' when he realises that there's nothing he can do to save his daughter.

The film gives us no 'closure' to either the crisis or individuals we meet. But that's the point that Bigelow is making here. That we live in a world where one unexpected event has the potential to cause global disaster, especially when we are all reliant on the reactions of flawed individuals acting on flawed information. And whether that happens on not is really, as one character states, a 'coin flip'.

I guess that a lot of people will feel unsatisfied with that conclusion: When you're primed for a thriller you want heroes to cheer on and villains to curse. Or at least a clear message and call to arms at the end of it all. But A House of Dynamite denies us either. The only thing that remains really is the existential horror of knowing we live in such a fragile world.",literal

"The superman movie of our time This is the superman movie of the TikTok generation. The one that doesn't have the context, nor the time to get the context, all they want is the next glitzy 8-second spiel before they move on.

The movie has zero character building. You're supposed to know everyone and everything from the start, and ... yes ... 8 second clips is about all you get to get to know people, before the next couple of unknowns are introduced.

The original Superman movies came from a comic book age, and were campy because of it. Christopher Reeves is still the best Superman to date.

The Brandon Routh and Henry Cavill movies had grit and seriousness, and looked like Superman took the step into more serious stories.

And then this movie came along. This movie has nothing. It is a shallow story, with zero character building, and just stringing action scene after action scene for gratuity. It would arguably be better if they had Michael Bay come in with his two-miles-out-revolving-shots, but not by much.

This is not a Superman movie. This is just the Superman of Fast and Furious movies.

This show is a great love letter to nerds, and as such any nerd should give this a try. With a bunch of new (and very lame) shows debuting, it's good to see something worth watching! This premise isn't exactly new but the execution is nothing short of brilliant. Give it a shot!!",literal
"A sharp, stylish rom-com that dissects modern love-though its heroine falls flat It can be hard for a playwright to transition into filmmaking. Plays are famously staid, physical affairs, relying more on dialogue than visual storytelling to convey emotion and plot. Yet Celine Song has made the leap from playwright to filmmaker with a visual fluency and ease that's nothing short of remarkable. Her feature debut Past Lives (2023) became an indie darling, earning an Oscar nomination for Best Screenplay. While its dialogue was crisp and lyrical, it was Song's command of silences and glances that gave the film its emotional resonance. She now follows that impressive debut with Materialists (2025), a quasi-rom-com that strikes while the iron is hot.

Materialists follows Lucy (Dakota Johnson), a New York City matchmaker who views dating through the lens of a financial market-assigning value to men and women based on traits, assets, and compatibility metrics. She doesn't pretend love is purely romantic; she's practical, even transactional. But her worldview is tested when she begins dating Harry (Pedro Pascal), a charming and wealthy suitor, just as John (Chris Evans), a struggling actor and former flame, reappears and rekindles an effortless chemistry.

Song appears especially drawn to love triangles-Past Lives also revolved around a woman caught between two worthy men. But she never reduces her characters to reality-TV archetypes or rom-com clichés. If anything, Materialists functions as an elevated romantic comedy: it still follows familiar narrative beats, but with a more grounded and honest exploration of love than the dreamy worlds of Meg Ryan or Richard Curtis films.

Materialists dives into the realities of modern dating, where apps and algorithms have turned people into commodities in a vast ""dating market."" Lucy's profession as a matchmaker becomes a narrative device for discussing these themes-her conversations with co-workers mirror the cold calculus behind dating app algorithms, where potential partners are treated like stocks or securities. Boxes are ticked, and wealth is a major factor-no romanticism required. Yet the film avoids becoming a cynical screed about the death of love. Instead, it confronts the tensions head-on: true love can feel ""easy,"" but that doesn't eliminate the realities of trade-offs, or the fact that marriage remains a financial partnership as much as a romantic one.

This sociological bent makes Materialists fascinating to watch-it often feels more like a relationship essay than traditional entertainment. Still, it delivers the genre's essential pleasures: there are satisfying beats and feel-good moments, but with sharper dialogue and more originality than usual. Some lines recall early Richard Curtis in their memorability. Song's playwriting background serves her well here.

Returning to the love triangle structure, Song treats each character with empathy, resisting the urge to vilify one in favor of a tidy moral. All three are endearing but imperfect, and their emotional depth makes you want to spend more time with them. This is especially true of the two men. Pascal finally lands the romantic lead that the internet has long wanted for him-his charm and sly smile are irresistible, and he carries a late, vulnerable scene with deft dramatic control. Evans, a rom-com veteran, leans into a quieter, more melancholic role. His longing and quiet devotion to Lucy-despite her questionable treatment of him-are convincingly portrayed.

The weak link is Lucy herself. As the titular ""materialist,"" she's meant to evolve from pragmatic matchmaker to romantic lead, but she remains frustratingly underwritten. Johnson, whose signature style often leans toward aloof detachment, doesn't help. There's little insight into Lucy's inner world or motivations. She's burdened with being both the audience's point of entry and the character undergoing the biggest arc-yet the script and performance don't give her enough complexity to support that dual role. As a result, the film's emotional center feels muted.

Ultimately, Materialists is a worthy, if slightly uneven, follow-up to Past Lives. It doesn't linger in the soul the way Song's debut did, but it plays with the rom-com form in thoughtful, compelling ways. With sharp dialogue, a probing thesis, and two richly drawn male leads, it elevates the genre's average. Still, when your central character-the fulcrum of both the romance and the film's thematic weight-feels undercooked, one of the film's key pillars noticeably wobbles.",figurative
"Almost nailed it So close

After the war America decided it would mark it and promote hard work by getting a volunteer from each state to compete in the long walk. No end line, walk until one remains. All in for there own reasons our movie centres around Ray and Peter. Two people who become friends on the treacherous path to death.

A lot of that movie I enjoyed, I liked the pacing, your watching 50 people walk but I would say every 10-15 minutes some event or ""moment"" happens that keeps you interested.

My only issue is the ending, the last 5 minutes to me made no sense and completely ignored the message the movie wanted to make, I could be an idiot and just not get it but it absolutely took me out of the movie and dropped the rating.

This is not a horror, gore at times, good cast great supporting acts, 7/10.",literal
"In Spite of Ourselves Greetings again from the darkness. For the sake of her friends, family, and self, I do hope Lynne Ramsay's movies do not reflect her real-life persona. Don't get me wrong ... she's an extraordinary filmmaker, but to put it mildly, her films are not what we would label 'uplifting'. Proof of these two descriptions can be found in WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT KEVIN (2011) and YOU WERE NEVER REALLY HERE (2017), and now again in her latest. The 2017 English translated novel by Ariana Harwicz has been adapted by Ms. Ramsay, Enda Walsh (HUNGER, 2008) and Alice Birch (THE WONDER, 2022). It's an absorbing film featuring what is likely the year's best and most haunting performance.

When we first meet Grace (Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence) and Jackson (Robert Pattinson), they are a wild and free couple who dance to the Pinky & Perky (not Alvin and the Chipmunks) version of ""Let's Twist Again."" Jackson has inherited a rundown house in rural Montana from his recently deceased uncle, and they fix up the place enough to move in. Sex and laughter fill their days right up until the baby is born. Postpartum depression has been conveyed in other movies, yet I don't believe it's ever been as visceral as what we witness here. Grace clearly loves her baby, while everything else about her own existence seems to anger and disappoint her ... the house, the dog, and especially Jackson.

Grace sinks to a level we don't often witness. It's so painful and uncomfortable to watch, and Jennifer Lawrence is fearless in her portrayal of Grace's downward spiral. Robert Pattinson plays Jackson as a normal guy who loves his wife, while having no clue how to handle the situation. Therein lies the power of this story. We could know Grace and Jackson, and we could be the folks at the party trying so hard to say the right things ... those things that turn out to be the worst things to say. We could also be that spouse willing to give the other enough space to find themselves.

Thanks to superb cinematographer Seamus McGarvey, the film has a gritty 1970's look and feel to it, and excellent (though limited) supporting work is provided by (Oscar winner) Sissy Spacek, rarely seen Nick Nolte, and the always interesting LaKeith Stanfield. The soundtrack is unusual and fascinating, including songs by such diverse artists as Elvis, Toni Basil, Cocteau Twins, Peggy Lipton, Nick Lowe, and Cream. As a bonus, the film features the best ever use of John Prine and Iris Dement singing ""In Spite of Ourselves"", a perfect fit. Mental health issues and depression are serious topics, and have rarely (if ever) been more accurately portrayed than what we see in this latest from filmmaker Lynne Ramsay. Despite the brilliant filmmaking and memorable performance, it's not an easy movie to recommend. It's only for those who can appreciate the magic within the dark clouds.

"Fantastic and horrible This is one of those films, that are impossible to rate. I want to give it a 1/10 and a 10/10 at the same time.

The film plays on so many notes and crams in so much plot, that no character development I believable. The result is a superficial and pretentious piece of overly sentimental work. Nothing works in this film, the way the filmmakers intend it to. But that's why I loved it so much. I haven't laughed so hard since watching Apartment 1303 - a horror film that does the exact same thing as this film. Just watch how a caricatured Dave Franco goes from the largest and most unbelievable smile to a very serious face while physically proclaiming his love for another person in a scene where everything is off.

Yes - this film is so bad it's good. And it keeps going hard from start to finish. Almost every scene is a laugh riot, and I seriously can't wait rewatching it with a couple of friends.",figurative
"There's More Ham in This than on Your Easter Table Is this supposed to be a comedy? It's not funny. Is it supposed to be a drama? It's not dramatic, it's just silly with a script to match. Why would fine talents like Kristen Wiig, Laura Dern, Allison Janney or Carol Burnett agree to be involved in such a clunker? The budget for this must have gone for big salaries to convince talented actresses to lower themselves to portray caricatures. The club in the series looks nothing like the B&T in Palm Beach (which it is obviously trying to parody). The best parts of the series are the opening aerial shots of the real PB. Once the dialogue begins, find something more worthy of your time.",literal
"Shazam!! This film is about four magicians brought together to perform the ultimate trick...to rob a bank (or so they would have you believe). I think that's as far as anyone really got with the plot apart from a few obvious twists along the way. Each of the four magicians is drafted in for their individual talents however these aren't really highlighted or explored during the film in any detail. In fact there is no character development at all which is more disappointing given the fact that the cast includes Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman among others. 

So a few minutes in and they perform their robbing a bank trick, the FBI man and the Interpol girl, who are somehow teamed up, are flummoxed so they take the magicians in for questioning. This doesn't go well for the FBI as the magicians use their mind/card tricks to outwit them and in the end they are let go. So the FBI calls in the help of Morgan Freeman, whose job is working out and explaining how tricks are done, to help. He has clearly seen this all before and explains the bank robbery within seconds. 

This is where i kind of lost interest in the film. Anyway there are some attempts at this stage to add some depth to the movie but these all fail. The confrontations between Caine and Freeman are tired and they both just seem to be going through the motions. The love interest between the FBI man and the Interpol girl is forced and comes from nowhere. Basically she is hot and they are working on a case together so they fall in love. Even the main four cast members have no chemistry or likability. 

So moving on a couple more tricks are performed and the cat and mouse game with the FBI continues. I wont ruin the disappointing end but let's just say there are a few twists that anyone who has seen a movie before would have worked out by now and then the film ends. 

All in all the worst film I've seen in a long time and shame on Woody Harrelson for following his excellent performance in Seven Psychopaths with this garbage.",literal
"Nuremberg Wow, saw this at TIFF. Powerful film. Russell Crowe, Rami Malick, Michael Shannon were all fantastic , as well as the rest of the cast. Harrowing scenes of the Final Solution. You could hear a pin drop in the theater when they were showing actual scenes of Nazi atrocities. Highly recommend watching this film!",literal
"Hasn't Aged Well Lets be real - this was probably a 6 in the 80s.

Wasn't Hughes' best effort, to say the least.

But it's really hard to watch, now.

I'm giving it a 4 strictly because it is culturally relevant; and as a cinephile - it's fun to watch a young Bill Paxton and Robert Downey jr.

Anthony Michael Hall, and the rest, never really became anything.

I find all of the 80s cult classics are really starting to be hard to watch.

If you're not Gen X - this show will be a 1 star. Lol Don't waste your time.

If you're Gen X - it's still hard to get through.

A. M. H. is the star - and he's as annoying as Jar Jar Binks.",literal
"Brilliant so far This is currently my favorite show that's running (honestly though, it doesn't have much competition). The music is phenomenal and I hope the composer wins an award. It's not everybody's brand of comedy, but just because something isn't lol funny doesn't mean it's not funny. Although we're at episode 3 and nothing of huge significance has happened yet, I'm 100% invested in the characters and can't wait to watch it every week.",literal
"Makes you look hard at our sexual behaviour as a species... You watch it and you realise the guy committing the crime is clueless as to what he's doing... You realise the victims have no idea what's happening sometimes. It makes you realise that other people do not see reality like you do.

It blew my mind... to watch so many ""good people"" play a part on such a dynamic stage of humanity.

We have a lot of work to do...

This show does well to showcase that.

Beautiful script, performances (many awards should be forthcoming), and editing.

5 star experience as a season.

"An unpretentious, hilarious romp If you insist on having movies provide you with a substantial theme, intricate sub-plots, and well developed deep characters then this movie is not for you.

However, if you belong to a slightly less snobbish school of thought that believes that the salient purpose of any movie is to entertain, then you will love ""Weird Science"".

""Weird Science"" is also one of two movies (""16 Candles"" is the other)that feature Anthony Michael Hall at a point in his career when he was far and away the funniest thing on the screen.  All you need to do is see him hold up Molly Ringwald's underwear to a bathroom mobbed with nerds in ""16 Candles"", or hear him deliver the classic line ""The chicks can't hold the smoke, that's what it is,."" in ""Weird Science"" to appreciate his natural hilarity.

The plot is way out there.  Two teenage misfits create a woman using a computer.  She prods them to improve their teenage lives and shows them how to have fun.  The humor is often slapstick schtick.  Many of the jokes are obvious.  The popular kid/nerdy kid clash has been done to death, but this movie still works big time!

Priceless scenes include a scene in a downtown bar where Gary gets drunk and Gary's and Wyatt's run-ins with Wyatt's older brother Chet.",literal
"Pure Disappointment Now You See Me: Now You Don't is surprisingly disappointing. The movie is boring, cringy, and the writing feels oddly cheap compared to the previous films. The cast is great and a few tricks are enjoyable, but too many scenes are unnecessary and impossible to ignore.

It feels like something my grandparents would find interesting, but it definitely isn't made for today's audience or newer generations. Overall, a letdown.",literal
"The Original = Awesome. The Reboot = SUCKS. My rating is based on the original. Can't punish 20 seasons for one, huge dud. For 20 seasons this was a fantastic show. Loved the cast and storylines. Even the cast changes were fine. I miss most of them. The show is a classic. The reboot sucks. What were they thinking with that cast? Sam Waterson and Anthony Andersen are just fine but beyond them, the cast is horrible.",literal
"Could this show be the Next Best Thing? As a sitcom, St. Denis Medical knows its job and does it well. Extremely well, in fact.

Balance. That's what SDM has. Balance between laughs and morality, clever funny and gut-funny, and most importantly-absurdity and reality.

This show stands way above the likes of Superstore or Brooklyn 99 because it weaves in a substantial amount of realism in terms of hospital scenarios, moments, terminology, and vibe.

It's obviously not the show's main goal to be a realistic depiction (in that case, watch 'The Pitt',) but they are still not sacrificing realism for a comedy setting on the cheap.

Superstore has plenty of good laughs, but its depiction of working at a big box store is woefully inaccurate. Just atrocious.

Brooklyn 99 is much worse, in a different universe than an NYPD precinct 😂

But SDM is doing something special. It's a clever, ""Office""-style comedy (Was the Office a descent depiction of an office??) without requiring an epic suspension of belief.

So much good to point to, so far.

An impressive cast of characters - they all feel likeable. Again, the show strikes great balance between tropes and originality. Fluff and depth. Makes for a very enjoyable watch. I am hopeful. LFG, SDM, FTW.",literal
"Lowered my initial rating after season 2 Season 1 was Absolutely terrific. Great drama between the characters and the story writing was very good. Season 2 however was horrible! I rated S1 with a 9/10. S2 was. 4-5/10. I don't understand what happened. The story line sucked but also a few characters just seemed to be completely different from S1 in how they were portrayed. Writing was bad, but even the music used was bad compared to S1. Everything went down hill... I was so pumped for S2.... Now I think it should just end and lost all confidence in the writers to get back on track.",literal
"A Baseball Lovers Must See! For those of us who love baseball, this is one of the movies that is required viewing. It is the tale of kids, a game, and a ball. The love of a game that has been and always will be America's pastime. A young man who has no understanding of baseball is befriended by a group of baseball junkies and we watch his summer time adventure. We learn how much one summer can mean to you when your young. If you love baseball or not, This movie will be a great, funny and touching story for you. Highly Recommended.",literal
"LOVE Ghosts - both the American AND UK version! I know many people prefer the UK version but I actually love both shows. Yes, the UK version is more detailed and in-depth, with a more subtle sense of humour but I think some of that's because the American version has to get everything done within the 20 minutes limit.

I am a bit miffed that there were fewer US episodes this year - I heard that some of the cast or crew got Covid so they had to curtail the filming. Too bad. And the UK version only has 6 eps per season but each ep. Is 100% quality.

Last week in the American version they introduced a girl from the 80s who if she were alive today would be my age. Loved her - hope she comes back.

I have noticed the American cast is better looking than the UK cast but isn't that always the case? There also isn't one dud character. And I love the sweetness and the kindness shown between the living and the dead. But what makes this show so unique is the coming together of people from different periods of history - endlessly fascinating.",literal
"It's like watching Anime, and that's why it's my thing! Hits hard in the best way. The action scenes are insane - easily some of the best sword-fight choreography this year, and every clash feels heavy and clean. The drama works too, with a solid emotional core that keeps you hooked between the fights. A few side characters could've used more depth and some episodes slow down a bit, but overall it's a killer action series with top-notch quality and real heart - and I'm definitely waiting for the next season.",literal
"Another franchise ruined by Disney. Goodbye, Predator I was personally very disappointed with the movie, although I already suspected it would turn out that way. Anything from these classics like Star Wars, Predator, and others that now belong to Disney always ends up with that investor influence behind the scenes, trying to make everything cute, with friendly little creatures. The original concept of the extraterrestrial hunter ends up being diluted. The mysterious hunter from another planet, the one no one really understands, completely disappears. All that sense of mystery gets lost because of a business move designed to expand the Predator franchise to families who go to the cinema on Sundays, so the grandma, the dad, the dog, and the 10 year old kid can all watch a non-violent movie. Disney tries to sell it to us as if the audience were all children, too sensitive to handle blood or anything intense.

In my opinion, the movie lost all the mystery, all the fascination , it lost everything. I was disappointed, and I don't know if I'll keep following any future projects from classic sci-fi franchises that Disney has bought.",literal
"Love this show Honestly i'm really hoping they have a season 3, i would say 9 stars for season 1 and 8.5 for season 2, great at adapting to the pandemic to write Covid into the TV show and film, reminds me of the early days when we didn't know what to expect. I wish lead Actors weren't getting paid so much but they are amazing in this show. I'm normally into fantasy/science fiction so this is not what I would normally watch but for this to score so well means it's good af.",literal
Squid Games Samurai Style Watched the first episode and this is Squid Games but with Samurai. The visuals are great. The only difference is they are not on a remote island and there is only one game with multiple legs with requirements. It would have been funny if the main characters number was 456. So far I have enjoyed the first episode.,literal
"Enjoyable but stupid Jack Whitehall delivers a surprisingly decent performance, making this genuinely enjoyable... until that one line. The moment he exclaims, ""Oh that was my brother?!?"" was a truly mind-numbingly stupid plot twist that completely shattered the immersion and ruined an otherwise fun viewing experience. The writing, in that one moment, felt incredibly lazy and contrived. It's a shame, as his portrayal was genuinely good up to that point. The reveal was the definition of unnecessary.",literal
"Heartfelt exploration about aging This show was one of the greatest shows that I've seen all year, one of the main subjects and what makes this such a beautiful show is the exploration of human connection throughout the entire show and every single little moment and interactions reminds us of that.

The mistery that motivates the entire plot isn't particularly interesting and if you're looking for a mistery show then this isn't it but it works to move the plot forward and that's more than enough.

Now granted this show doesn't have anything new to offer nor any groundbreaking industry changing stuff, but it doesn't need it, what it has it's more than enough.

"Season 8 makes the entire show a complete waste of time Game of thrones spent all the time creating character arcs, building up the white walkers and world building, only for season 8 to come along and render all of that for nothing. For example they spent all this time building up Jon Snows secret birthright as a Targaryen, only to have it be for nothing. Dany, protector of the weak suddenly (and I do mean suddenly) hears some bells and a switch flips in her head. Oh and Bran can warg but he does nothing with it. But ends up becoming king. There's way too much and the writers clearly wanted to finish up this show in a hurry so that they could go work on star wars. Congrats, you ruined your cash cow. There is absolutely no reason to rewatch this series now.",literal
"Fallout: it's A Banger Not that fast-paced and yet: Lots stuff going on. Paying lots attention is lots necessary. And then lots fun. Lots entertainment.

Seems lots like a video game turned TV..",literal
"Locked (and loaded?) No pun intended - this has Stephen King vibes to it. At least that what it's felt to me. Not just the episodic nature that made me have callbacks ... but how the characters are written. They all have their issues, they all feel real.

And they all have mostly best interest at heart. Since we are human and flawed. That is obviously not always the case. Be it the cop friend, be it the teacher with her own issues. Even if you mean well ... it can feel and be mean to others.

The vibe and the general feeling about this was good ... and the movie exceeded those expectations. Was lucky enough to catch it at a (surprise) preview - so we didn't know what to expect.

But going into this thinking about horror movies ... it sort of defies the rules that have been set. It is unwritten law that (most) horror movies start with a really scary scene ... that is supposed to get the viewers hooked. Well the introduction here is quite ... well underplayed. It is what we know from the trailers ... kids go missing - actually a whole class ... well not quite, but you'll see and understand.

We start with the teacher and her point of view and then switch to other characters - her segment ending with ... well you may not grasp entirely what is being done there ... but it will become evident .. I am not cutting to the chase am I? But you'll understand .. by the time the last segment starts I had figured out what was happening ... and that is not a bad thing.

Even if I knew where it was leading and what the reason of the disappearance was before it was actually revealed on screen ... it is so well told and acted ... the sound design doing its best to enhance that feeling too ... bring them back? Can it be done? Well you'll have to watch to see ... and now ... bring her back .. the other most anticipated horror movie of the year .... coming out ... soon.",literal
"Seasons 1-6: outstanding. 7: daft but good. 8: disappointing Let's say you're reading these reviews and haven't watched GoT yet, but now that it's finished are considering the marathon. What's the consensus? In this case, the consensus is accurate, and that is:

Seasons 1-6: outstanding. Deep world-building, intelligent dialogue, epic set-pieces worthy of Hollywood, expert acting, detailed plotting, genuine surprises, great soundtrack used sparingly. GoT is worth watching for these seasons, definitely.

Season 7: you suddenly notice the writing and plotting has taken a sharp dive downwards in quality. There are inexplicable ideas, inconsistent characterisation and soap-opera dramas. But at least the entertainment value is still very high, so it gets a pass.

Season 8: this drop chasms down to depths you didn't think possible. The writing has got so amateurish that the still-fantastic production values are no longer enough to save it. If you ever enjoyed Lost but were amazed at how bad the final season was, you're in familiar territory here.

The biggest problem with the final season was it took us out of the story and got us thinking about its many weaknesses. We lost our suspension of disbelief. Fatal for fiction. It also ruined the series-arcs to the point where a rewatch of the entire series is pointless.

So can I recommend a GoT marathon for newcomers? Yes, the first 6 seasons are worth the disappointments later on. But best series of all time it is not. It could've been, but dropping the ball in the final stretch puts it behind the following superior series more worthy of your marathon:


* Battlestar Galactica (2003-2008)
* Twin Peaks (all 3 seasons, plus the movie)
* Breaking Bad",literal
"So I was wrong I was expecting a clown show, what with the marketing and fuss, and was surprised to have found the movie good? The sets are elaborate and the movie was more colorful than I was expecting based off the trailers. The cast was strong and for the most part the singing was excellent. Cynthia Erivo was stand out for me. What a voice! Some strange dance moves here and there. What most intrigued me was the plot. I won't go into spoilers but it made me very interested to know how it comes together in the end. I'll have to watch the final film to determine if this is truly a masterpiece. But I'll say this - I'll be watching.",figurative
"Good but slightly underwhelming I just finished watching marvel studios fantastic four and may I just say, it was fantastic. Jokes aside, after thunderbolts and now this, may I just say marvel is coming back. The things design was spot on and Mr fantastics struggle between science and family was clear and amazing. This has a chance of being my favorite marvel movies. Even the characters that weren't built on like mole man were still incredibly. The whole thing with galactus wanting Franklin made it new and exciting, and different enough from the 2007 movie. Also, the post credit scene with Dr Doom was masterful. Also, the whole thing with Johnny and deciding the silver surfers language was amazing. I was a bit confused when there was nothing to explain the thunderbolts post credit scene, but maybe it will be explained in doomsday. I thought that Franklin bringing sue back to life was a great way of showing just how powerful he is. The thing was amazing, by showing that he was now pretty used to his body, but also showing his struggle with it to. The silver sulfur was a lot of fun and had a pretty great backstory, even if it was almost exactly like the one from the 2007 movie. Her sacrifice was great while also being different enough to be exciting and shocking. Finally, galactus was amazing and his defeat by teleporting across the universe was great. It made it so we would not need to worry about him for a while, but also letting future movies the possibility to use him. Now for some of the parts that were less fantastic. First off, I wish Mr fantastic used his powers more. Even in the final battle, he rarely stretches and it was a bit disappointing. Also, the thing was extremely underutilized. It felt that every character did something major in the plot except for him, and that raises another problem that I have. I wish the movie was like 20 minutes longer, because we could have seen better character development and better world building. All in all, the movie was pretty good with a few minor problems.",literal
"Crime mistery done right One of my greatest gripes with Detective shows, is that usually they focus more on the drama, than the detecting part. One of my favorites, Monk, had the sin of revealing the culprit for the audience before the main character found out who's guilty. Also lot of detective shows make the main character an master on everything and leave the other characters as witness to their greatness with very little to do. In this show meanwhile, it shows how being so smart afects the main's character life, inside and outside the police work, it shows how her brain works, and with funny and clever montages, shows how she solves things, not dumbing down the case, and the other characters complement her. Kaitlin Olson is amazing, as always funny, great chemistry with other actors. I really hope this show keep this up.",literal

"Seasons 1-2 great, 3 sadly no Season one: great - 7.5/10. Season two: perfection - 10/10. Season three: a bomb - 3.5/10.

My rating for the series averaging the three seasons: 7 (down from 9 after season two)

Review of season three:

I tried my best being patient until the finale of season three, really hoping the longer, ninety minutes final episode would somehow make up for the whole season by tying up all the pieces together and giving a satisfying enough ending.

Well it didn't. I'm more disappointed now than after seeing all the previous episodes of this season that just dragged. Especially after such an amazing time the show gave us with season two, season three feels like such an utter mess and a waste of time. The stories are all over the place, there are too many plot holes along with unnecessary subplots aimed only for the shock value, opportunistic and unrealistic choices of actions by the characters, the list goes on. The whole season drags while nothing really happens until the final episode, and what happens in the final episode all at once is rushed, forced, too predictable in some parts and too irrational in other parts, and ends with making the show feel like a soap opera, far from the high-quality drama that was expected after season two.

The writing especially was what made the White Lotus season one and two so unique and special. With season three, it's almost like someone else other than Mike White wrote it.

I have rewatched both season one and two and still enjoyed them but this last season, I most definitely will not be rewatching. If you haven't seen the show yet, my advice is to watch the first two seasons and skip three.

Now here're some of my theories for why season three turned out to be so subpar and disappointing.

1. The hype and all the awards this show got from 2021 to 2023 unfortunately got to Mike White's head and his writing and directing got lazy.

2. Perhaps Mike White wasn't that into filimg in Thailand after his #1 choice of location, Japan, got scrapped due to zero tax incentives the country offered to international film productions at the time. The lack of passion for the location led to lack of motivation, which led to poorer quality script, and directing. (Btw fyi: Japan now offers tax incentives. It just unfortunately didn't at the time the producers of the show were scouting for location)

3. The high heat of Thailand that multiple cast members mentioned and/or complained about on promotional interviews during their filimg the season for the long seven months maybe contributed to a lack of focus, energy, and clarity needed for the season to feel more alive and coherent for the audience. Mike White has talked about his physical exhaustion after the filming of season two and how he worked on building strength to prepare for the filming of the following season. Perhaps despite his best efforts, the high heat and humidity that is especially tough for people that are used to the dry moderate weather in California, got the better of him, diminishing his capacity on all fronts.

4. The season tried to take on the theme of spirituality with Thai Buddhism, but with the surface-level understanding of the writer/director of the religion and its core teachings, it only achieved a paper-thin, superficial effect throughout the entire season. Had the whole theme been explored and presented with more depth, it could've had a stronger impact on the character developments. As a Buddhist myself, I found the monk's lines shallow, dumb in some parts, and falsely representing Buddhist teachings, confusing them with Hinduism and Christianity, which was frustrating to watch.

5. The mixing themes of Buddhism, Christianity, and Greek mythology into an already-packed storyline of multiple characters was a disaster. Again, with deep themes from multiple angles touched on supeficially and crammed into small scenes, the show tried to be deep, spiritual, and thought-provoking, but for its superficiality it comes off as rather pretentious and empty.

6. Mike White's using the ideas and storylines he came up with when he was sick and running fever was maybe not such a great idea.

But.. who really knows why season three was so bad compared to the previous two. Maybe as a line from this season ""bad things come in three"" goes, the number 'three' of season three was just a bad luck, just not meant to be.

Just so as not to end on a sore note, the good wirh season three are:

1. Casting. Great as always. Too bad not all the actors' talents were utilized to their fullest potential. I feel bad especially for Jason Isaacs whose character was basically drugged the entire season. But some of the actors had scenes where they really shone.

2. Acting. Patrick Schwarzenegger and Aimee Lou Wood are the breakout stars of season three. Sam Rockwell stole the show in all the scenes he appeared. Jon Gries' character's creepiness and darkness was well-played. Morgana O'Reilly who plays Pam brings a nice touch of normalcy and also some sense of warmth in a few scenes she appears.

Hopefully the series will get the redepmtion it needs with the next season.",figurative
"Very good. My wife and mother all loved this!! Definitely worth the watch. Easy to binge. Every actor performed well. Each episode contains new cases that are easily relatable and still keeps the continuity of the overall story. We'll done. This didn't try to be like other Doctor shows, it was more about the personal relationships of the character's and not too much about the egos of the Dr's.",literal
"My take on the long walk My take on The long walk, I symbolize this movie as our walk of life like an endless walk untill our inevitable end comes, on this journey, everyone chooses to walk their path differently, but everyone will reach the same final destination but what matters most is how we get there, losing hope? Giving up?, for sacrifice? Or fighting till your last breath? But we some moments get boring and some get your blood pumping, but hiding from all the tragedy, there is a little light of hope! We walk our path differently but what matters most is how we leave it, Good movie.",figurative
Good if you are 12 For the average teenager or the big kid avengers-Netflix rhapsody fan. I'll recommend go and see this. For anyone else interested in a good predator movie stick to with the original or perhaps Prey or the alien vs predator. For the film buff who got deceived with the trailer believing might be some smart movie new view on the franchise fools on you as it was on me. The trailer is better than the movie. With that I said it all. For all of the great story tellers please refrain from watching and keep resubmitting to this nonsense. Peace.,literal
"Now you see me, but never again How did a big budget, solid actor, much anticipated film yield such poor writing, directing and editing? Magic, apparently.

The trick here is to fool audiences into paying for this nonsense. Want to spend 2 hours of your life watching someone else ooh and aah in in a magic show or play in an escape room filmed on screen?. Only thing worse than the script may be Rosamund Pike's accent. Oy.",literal
"Nope Enough is enough on NCIS spin offs. Harmon is in it for the $$ not the fans. He could have at least put in an appearance for the David McCallum tribute on NCIS. Showing up now doesn't cut it. This latest iteration is not interesting at all. The episodes drag on, cast doesn't click. Just not up to NCIS standards. Also could the music get any louder? Giving 4 stars because the Franks character was decent. The first two episodes storyline could have been completed in a single episode. Will be surprised if this makes it to season two. NOLA, LA and Hawaii were great spinoffs because they didn't rely on gloomy Gibbs.",literal
"Was not expecting it to be this good I don't know anything about kpop or ever heard it before but my gf really wanted to watch it, so we fired up some popcorn and settled in.

I thought it would be corny and lame tbh, but by the end i was laughing along and tearing up at some parts.

It's the funny parts are hilarious, the exaggerated expressions were great and the animation style (think spiderverse) made it all feel really natural and ""new"". I guess since I'm not used to animation and facial expressions being portrayed like this in western animation.

The emotional development is wonderful. It's not a very complex story but they really know how to tug at your heartstrings.

The animation is top tier, the fight sequences look really good, and it feels almost neo-korean cyberpunky with all the neon glows.

The songs are probably the best part. They were all really really good.

You writing is phenomenal- the jokes land, the characters' motivations and actions make sense, and it just has a solid plot.

This is my unexpected favorite movie of 2025 now, unironically. I have asked my girlfriend to show me more kpop songs now lol.",figurative
"Only kept by the sheer demand of fangirls. This show should've ended years back. The writer(s) were clearly exhausted on generating yet another similar grand plot. Things get boring, especially when you know that death for the protagonist will almost always be nullified sooner or later. This brings no depth to the overall plot, no layers to the character, and they all mixed together creates what you call a disastrous show. 

Conclusion: all good show should have an end, because when it doesn't, it turns bad. Really bad.",literal
"the best movie of 2025 KPop Demon Hunters is a wild, stylish blast of adrenaline wrapped in dazzling visuals and kinetic action-but it's the soundtrack that truly steals the show. With a fierce mix of hard-hitting K-pop, electric beats, and haunting melodies, every battle feels like a concert. Each track perfectly matches the tone, whether it's a high-octane fight or a dramatic reveal. The music doesn't just set the mood-it defines it. Fans of K-pop and anime-style storytelling will love every pulse-pounding, dance-fueled moment. A must-experience for music and action lovers alike. KPop Demon Hunters blends supernatural action with heartfelt storytelling in a way no other 2025 film does.",figurative
"disappointing indeed I had hopes that this show would be as funny as Scrubs. Alas, it depicts a group of people who for the most part should be no where near a hospital, and especially not providing medical care for patients. Instead they look like the type of underqualified morons, imbeciles, and idiots who might be appointed to those positions by the new Trump administration. The documentary style of the show is potentially good, but does not come near the quality of similar efforts such as What We Do in The Shadows, or The Office. I watched the first episode without a single chuckle, but saw several cringe moments as health care workers are depicted as dangerously incompetent. I stopped watching five minutes into episode two.",literal
"Die My Love for cinematography Just got out of the cinema. Worst movie on the festival I currently am at, maybe worst movie I've seen this year.

Movie starts nowhere, takes you nowhere, and every minute of the journey is tiring and uncomfortable.

Artistic choices are all over the place, scenes are completely meaningless and drag on for to long, there is no story whatsoever, even top notch world best actors couldn't save this film.",figurative
"Has potential As miserable as the actual DMV is and what I expected from the show it's actually pretty good. I think the cast is charming and the writing is actually funny. Harriet Dyer is a great foil and turns out to be a fantastic physical comedian, Tim Meadows is brilliant as always, Molly Kearney is a huge surprise given how little she did on her years on SNL And Alex Tarrant is dreamy and totally believable.

If this show builds on what it has in the first two episodes I have high expectations for it. I like.",literal
"A one patient medical shoe Watched three episodes. The show fixes on a single patient, a former doc, who lost her memory in an """"I Love Lucy"" like revival. The show lacks depth, acting, music, and continuity to bring it to the level of Pitt, ER, or St Elsewhere, currently drowning at the level of Dr Quincy Medical Examiner, but in a more 2025way than that 1980 script.",literal
"Terribly Overdone Of course a ""Grinch"" movie is going to make money with big names like Jim Carey and Ron Howard...

At 104minutes long, the movie should have been 90minutes long. There was easily 14 minutes of pure GARBAGE. Jim Carey could have done such a splendid job of playing the Grinch; however, it seems obvious that Ron Howard allowed Mr. Carey to do his thing - unfortunately, it was severely over done! While I couldn't think of anyone more perfect to play the Grinch, someone needed to put a leash on Carey as he drastically overplayed and ruined this movie. It's unfortunate, the movie could've been so much more... with LESS! I just watched this movie for the first time in 10yrs with my little girls, and I hated it!",literal
"It's certainly magnificent Early on in Sirk's MO, a character says to Rock Hudson,

""Becoming a doctor is like an obsession. It will consumes you and make you consume it even more. But when you do...it will be a MAGNIFICENT OBSESSION.""

Granted here I have maybe not quoted right in all ways, but the spirit of the sentence comes through starkly and brilliantly.

Obsession. With being a doctor? Obsession. With getting it right? Obsession. Can you save a blind women (and it was his fault)? Obsession. Of course he can?

When he does it will be magnificent.

Boom - sha - car - luck!!!

Hudson is of course here in this film and it is his film to be in. He is of course magnificent as the titular obsession. Film deals with obsession in many ways, not least in its title.

Sirk is a director par good and this film is certainly one he will be remembered for, even when he has gone. He directs MO like his drip-line is feeding him the very spirit of the ghost of a dead doctor. The doctor Hudson sees prompting him from above, like heaven, only better. It is a thick and strongly resonant image, reminiscent of late-Fandolini, perhaps even early-Baddger. Reflections and the surface of things play a large part in Hudson's style and he cleverly counterposes what we see with what else we see, asking us what might be the truth. Can we see past the surface? Also, well script.",literal
"""Six inches can double a man's value in the market"" Unless I misunderstood, the movie's message is : ""When it comes to dating... you HAVE to settle"". A somewhat interesting romance script, with a heavy emphasis on dating. Good and bad stuff for both genres.

Dakota delivers a strange character. A somewhat calculative woman, but very purposedly written that way. Her delivery is quite flat throughout.. except in a few key moments that convinced me she knew what she was doing. Her character isn't particularly charming or overwritten. She does feel unreal and tactless at times, but can be lukewarm when needed. She has a strange role because I've never met someone like that.. but it is possible, I guess. Her character is kind of unlikeable, you're not encouraged to root for her, and the movie makes no effort to suggest otherwise. But she has ups and downs, maybe even has an arc. She feels real (especially for New York) and is very much at the center of the film. In the end, I guess I bought it! Emotional pay off and all! Somehow, it works.

The pacing is VERY slow, especially for a 2 hour movie. The cinematography stands out at times, it is very well produced and executed overall. The acting feels stiff, still. And I don't particularly feel entertained or satisfied. It did made me doubt my prediction, but it got there in the end.

It's an okay watch, but maybe not for the theater.. which is something I realized I say too often now. The convenience of streaming, no doubt.",literal
"Definitely My Favorite Show!! Addicted from the very first episode! Great characters, cast & a dayyum great storyline! Like being back in day's of how sh¡t actually was done! (Back in my day anyway) A crime drama about an important contemporary issue, America's prison system. In Kingstown there are seven prisons who house 20,000 people in a 10 mile radius. The series follows the McLusky family who run the town & keep opposing forces from destroying the community. Jeremy Renner stars as ex-con Mike McLusky who with his brother Mitch, (Kyle Chandler) Kyle (Taylor Handley) & their mother, Mariam (Diane Weist). Kyle's a cop who like most of his fellow members of the Kingstown law enforcement, operate outside the law when it comes to working with Mike & Mitch. They describe what they do as bending the law not breaking it to keep the peace. The first two seasons were phenomenal! Every week had me anticipating the next episode! Season 2 last episode had me on the edge of my seat yelling at my TV!! There are so many things that happened I certainly hope the writers & producers don't just leave us all hanging! Just so many questions unanswered! Unfreakingbelievable !!

No word yet that season 3 is renewed but I certainly hope so with all that happened in that episode!

** Of course many prayers for Jeremy Renner for a full recovery after his accident this past January, but good God Jer! Please bring on another season,or 2, or 5! 💕✌🏻",literal
"Cloying, Manipulative and Underwhelming Forging personal connections can be difficult enough these days, even in casual circumstances. But what happens when we require someone to play a vital role for a pressing need and no one is available to stand in? That's when it may be time to place a call to Rental Family, a Tokyo-based company that provides individuals to step in and fill the missing link. It's also a perfect opportunity to provide work for unemployed actors, giving them a chance to ply their trade and gain experience at broadening the range of their craft while helping out others in times of need. Such is the case for Phillip Vandarploeg (Brendan Fraser), a largely unsuccessful American actor who moved to Japan years ago to make a cheesy toothpaste commercial but has since found few opportunities to further his career. He initially has reservations about serving as a professional impersonator, but, once he gets the hang of it, he finds himself quite adept at it. However, the deeper he gets into his assignments - such as playing a surrogate father/husband to help an ambitious single mother (Shino Shinozaki) get her daughter (Shannon Gorman) into a prestigious school and impersonating an entertainment journalist to allegedly profile an aging actor (Akira Emoto) and help him relive his memories before he loses them permanently - the more involved he becomes in his clients' lives, raising ethical questions that give him anguish but from which he has difficulty walking away. In many respects, ""Rental Family"" feels like a lightweight version of the excellent, recently released Austrian offering ""Peacock,"" one that aims for a crowd-pleasing vibe more than its substantive counterpart. Unfortunately, though, this is where this picture comes up short. To carry out its narrative objectives, writer-director Hikari's second feature outing is eminently predictable, interminably schmaltzy and heavy-handed to a fault, qualities that grow ever more cringeworthy the more the story progresses. And, when the picture attempts to break out of this mold and become less obvious, it goes overboard, turning preposterous and lacking in credibility. Add to that an excessive number of minor story threads, and you've got an unwieldy production that becomes tiresome and unfocused. What's more, this is a vehicle in which Fraser looks undeniably trapped, portraying a forgettable role that's a far cry below his considerable capabilities and a long way from his Oscar-winning performance in ""The Whale"" (2022). In fact, other than some gorgeous cinematography and a few admittedly touching moments in the aging actor story thread, this one is easily skipped without missing anything worthwhile. The issues addressed here are more substantial than the wispy fluff they've been accorded in this project, so, if these are subjects that truly interest you, give ""Peacock"" a much more deserved view in its place, a decision you're unlikely to regret.",figurative
Not the UK one I watched the UK version and liked it..I started watching the US version and didn't think I would like it. At first I didn't give the pilot a very high score. I came back and started it again and fell in love with it...As I got to know all of the ghosts and felt this was a charming series. I laugh at most of the episodes and binged on all of the episodes so far. I found no it's not the British one but It is just as good and I found in a lot of the episodes I liked better. So this Americanized version is very good in it's own right.,literal
"A nostalgic callback to the stories from my youth - but also a beautifully shot supernatural tale with charming performances and great production values There were two dominating forces in the eighties that had a lasting effect on my cinematic taste for ever after and also resulted in my undying love for fantasy, sci-fi and horror stories: Steven Spielberg and Stephen King. I guess it isn't an overstatement to say ""The Two Steves"" probably influenced and shaped the imagination - the dreams AND the nightmares - of an entire generation.

The main factor why I loved their movies and books was that kids roughly my own age figured so prominently in many of them. King wrote 'Firestarter', 'It' and 'Stand By Me', and Spielberg either directed or produced (via his company Amblin) 'E.T.', 'The Goonies' and 'Gremlins'. Those were stories where the young protagonists encountered aliens and monsters or where they themselves had supernatural powers - or where they just went on an adventure (to find a body or a long lost treasure) with grown-ups largely out of the picture. Now if you've seen 'Stranger Things', that should sound pretty familiar, right?

Of course it does: because 'Stranger Things' deliberately pays homage to all those stories - and it does it very, very well. And it's not a rip-off, it's a love letter. The show emulates the themes and a certain style from those eighties treasures, and while it is a (for me) very welcome callback to some of the favorite stories from my youth, it's also very much its own thing. I won't give away the plot here (I guess you get a pretty good picture what it's about from what I wrote above), but I would like to mention that it's beautifully shot, the effects and generally the production values are top-notch, and the period-inspired music is fantastic. The biggest shout-out, however, has to go to the ensemble of actors, especially the kids who play the protagonists: their charming performances are the key to why the show works as well as it does.

To sum it all up: If you're an eighties kid like me, this show is a must. For everyone else, it might depend a bit more on whether you're a genre fan or not, but if you do like supernatural stories, 'Stranger Things' is a treat. I'd rate it eight stars out of ten, but with an extra star for nostalgia, that's a 9.

"Safe ""Comedy"" This movie was okay.

It could have been great, but they went with the streaming service approach to comedy where nothing really happens. No notable laugh out loud moments, just a few character situations that make you go ""Thats an amusing thing to say/do"".

The biggest problem I had with the movie is that Jeff was nice to Arj from the start. He gave him work, clothes, food, friendship. But Arj literally stole from him so he got fired.

That's no premise to teach Jeff a lesson.

And Arj never really grows as a character. He's basically a jerk from start to finish.

Keanu was fantastic as always, but it feels like they could have done more with everyone.

Gabriel/Keanu literally ate mushrooms but they did nothing with it. No wacky, out of character behaviour, just mentioned that he ate them afterwards.

And that essentially epitomizes the movie. Good but not great.

Another month in the writing room, and pushing the characters further could have really built this into something so much better.",literal

The show has lost it's charm, patients and dilemma's about them aren't in focus anymore..sad to see what they've done to my favourite show..I used to be impatient about every new episode, I couldn't wait Thursday and new episode and now season 16 is out and I still haven't watched season 15",literal
"Not for everyone, but vital for those it hits. I knew this type of movie would be for me, but I also understand it's a very niche genre. I think to some level, you have to understand what she's going through to appreciate it. I didn't suffer PPD, but my husband and I were in a car accident that almost killed me and took the life of our 19yr old daughter. We had only just moved to a new state for a fresh start 2mos prior. The year after the accident, I became isolated, depressed, and started to lose it, much in the same as she did. My husband still had to work and provide for me and our other children since I was injured and broken mentally. She literally was living out my intrusive thoughts in the movie. Maybe my situation made it hit close to home and appreciate seeing that on the screen. It also made me feel for my husband who had the weight of the world on his shoulders while grieving and losing me at the same time. My husband and I have been separated for awhile and I don't blame him. The story plays out much like a fractured mind, it's all over the place, but that's the most honest way to depict the story. Despite some negative reviews, I loved it and am glad this movie exists. The performances were amazing, especially Jennifer's. I hope she gets another Oscar for this.",literal
"Atrociously bad I have read the reviews, I was kind of prepared, but I said whatever, I will watch something light, funny, nice clothes etc.

I resisted 15 minutes, and it was worse and worse. I can't imagine, first, why very good actresses have accepted to play with KK as lead character. I know that they have bills to pay, but this is a new low.

Then, the dialogues. So cheesy, it's inimaginable that a bunch of professional lawyers would speak like some 9 yo

"Absurd premise, histrionic script, waste of some really talented actors Dr. Amy Wolcott's miraculous recovery from a crash that erased eight years of memories but left her physically unscathed stretches medical credibility beyond repair. The show's premise - that a trauma severe enough to cause such specific retrograde amnesia wouldn't result in serious physical injuries or brain damage - is neuroscience fantasy at its most egregious. Watching her confidently stride hospital halls arguing for her right to practice medicine - while apparently suffering no cognitive deficits beyond the convenient plot-serving memory gap - feels like watching a medical drama written by someone whose only research was reading soap opera summaries. The show sacrifices scientific plausibility for dramatic convenience, undermining its own attempts at serious storytelling.",literal

The rehab I was at, all the staff had been there previously and stayed on and they worked for a pittance and were completely fooled by the nonsense the facility fed them. There were no psychedelics involved though lol.

It's actually a pretty good watch, but it left so many things unanswered, I genuinely thought there was going to be another episode...

It's a really good story, but some of the supporting cast were shockingly bad actors. I won't mention names just incase they read this, and some of the dialogue was just laughable...

It's worth watching just don't think you're going to get a definitive ending...

"I wanted to like this show When I first saw the commercials for this show I was so excited! Such an interesting idea. The acting is fine. My issue is with the writing. The writing in this show is honestly terrible. They clearly have no idea how trauma affects human beings. You're telling me she spent 6 years in a glass tank and survived? In total isolation, trapped, consistently drowning on/off? I'm sorry but that is not possible. EVEN IF that was possible, the amount of trauma she would then have to overcome. She would not be good to go and fight crimes after talking to a professional twice. NOT ONLY THIS but the amount of animosity that people are holding towards her. The new wife acts as if helping her find a place to stay and having visits with her son is the greatest act of betrayal from the lead male character and instantly treats her like a homewrecker and him like a traitor. People don't do this? Why would she ever have so much hate for someone who has been traumatized for 6 bloody years. Tortured for 6 bloody years. It's like the writers don't understand what motivates human behaviours. The new wife's character has so much potential for a good story line. She could be conflicted with feelings of pity and jealousy. She could be understanding to her face but behind closed doors crushed in this situation. That's how real people would handle this impossible situation. There is no way you would be flat out hostile to someone who your husband thought was dead and turns out they were just being tortured this whole time. Instead they make her a vindictive bitch and it's intolerable to watch. The main woman ""emily"" seems to wade through this show only slightly traumatized and still able to fight crime, which is ridiculous AND everyone in this show is bloody victim blaming like she just disappeared for 6 years like it was shits and giggles. I just don't get it. I feel for the actors because they did their part, they acted well. And that's probably why it's rated so high. But the writing is just garbage. I think the writers need to look at the roots of what motivates human behaviour because literally no one acts the way they portray it.",literal
"Oh boy... People are missing the point. Again. Lol This show is ridiculous. It's supposed to be! Duh It's brilliant, hilarious, sardonic, and dark. I'm only 2 episodes in, and I have laughed my ass off and gasped aloud.

Emma Thompson is outright fabulous and Bowie level cool! Darren Boyd is an absolute gas! Everyone else fits in perfectly with their quirks and charms and idiosyncrasies.

Down Cemetery Road is a gust of fresh air compared to many shows these days.

If you've been enjoying Slow Horses and Gary Oldman in his insane and genius role as Jackson Lamb, you'll love Down Cemetery Road as well.

I just can't get enough of either one of these shows and their immensely talented casts.

Bra-effing-vo!!",literal
"Amazing pilot I've been following this show's development and progress for 2 out of the 4 years it was being made for, and now that it's finally out I can say that it exceeded every expectation I had for it. Not only was the animation beautiful to look at, but the entire thing was so ridiculously absurd and full of life. The characters are likable and very entertaining, my favourite probably being Alastor. The writing was also spot on. While it may have relied a little too heavily on swearing at points, the whole concept of it being set in hell kind of acts as leeway for that, along with the cartoony expressions, sexual nature of some of the characters, etc. But there were certainly a lot of funny moments in this pilot, in fact I had a massive smile on my face the whole time Alastor was on screen. There was a clear emotional center as well at points, so it was nice to see an adult show that wasn't ONLY centered on raunchy comedy. The music and songs were fantastic too, filled with a lot of energy, helped by the amazing voice cast. All the voice actors/actresses did a superb job and no one slacked off in the slightest. This was clearly made with true love and passion and I really hope it gets more funding or a network picks it up.",literal
"BOOOORING and pointless What on earth???? What's it all about? Where's the fun and funny??? There's simply no point to this. DO NOT WATCH!!! However, to each his own, I guess!

"A classic If you grew up in the '90s or just love a good nostalgic flick, this one's a must-watch. The film follows a group of neighborhood kids during the summer of 1962 as they bond over baseball, friendship, and all the wild adventures that come with it. The characters are super lovable, especially Scotty, the new kid who finds his place among the gang, and Benny, the cool, athletic leader of the group. They face everything from the perils of a legendary dog named ""The Beast"" guarding a baseball signed by Babe Ruth to classic childhood dilemmas. It's a great mix of humor, heart, and a bit of nostalgia that hits all the right notes. It captures the essence of childhood-those carefree summer days where the biggest worry was just holding onto your glove during a game. It's hilarious, quotable, and there are some seriously memorable moments that'll stick with you for a long time.",literal
"Flawed but Human Characters I've been binge watching the first six seasons since I was late to the Chicago Fire game.

It's particularly interesting the narratives I've read on here surrounding each character. If I didn't watch for myself I'd have a very different view of some characters. Dawson gets portrayed on here as some despicable person, but I never viewed her as any more of less opinionated, persistent, vocal than pretty much anyone else.

Each character has demonstrated growth throughout the series and there are times I want to smack them lol, and other times I want to hug them.

Some episodes drifted into the stereotypical bad guy story and it wasn't pleasant to watch. Ultimately, I'll listen to a Boden speech any day!",literal
"80's 80's 80's God bless the 80's, and may they live on way after their time!  This film captures the 80's geeks, preps, and class rivalry.  It was a hard time to fit in, but a fun time, like most teenagers, I had these fantasies that this movie reflects on.  I can not believe they got Wes from the Road Warrior to do a part.  The scene where the computer animated women talks to Michael Halls parent is hilarious, but sick.  The stuff going out of the chimney, the MX missile, and the kitchen turning blue is funny.  Bill Paxion or chet is a classic wait and see what happens to him.  Anyways rent it live it and be it! 8/10",literal
"Family members Sure! Here's your message expanded to 1000 characters:

Hi. I just want Jensen to be a regular on the show, please. He brings so much depth and charisma to his character, and his dynamic with Justin is truly something special. Their chemistry as brothers feels so natural and heartfelt, making every scene they share incredibly engaging. If making him a series regular isn't possible, could he at least guest star in a few more episodes? It would mean so much to the fans who have grown attached to his character and the bond he shares with Justin's. Their interactions add layers of emotion, humor, and intensity that make the story even more compelling. Every time they are on screen together, it feels like magic. It would be a real loss to not explore their relationship further. The audience is clearly invested, and keeping Jensen around would be a fantastic way to build on that excitement. Please consider giving him more screen time-he and Justin truly make an unforgettable duo.",literal
"Good for about 8 seasons then overstays its welcome. I was hoping during season 8 that they would get Koothrapalli married off. I also wondered what they were going to do with Stuart and the answer ended up being ""nothing"". I loved Big Bang's first 8 seasons and then got tired of the long, drawn out dramas surrounding Bernadette and Howard's baby and then Amy and Sheldon's courtship. 

Why do TV execs make a series go on until every last dollar of revenue is wrung out? Taxi was the ultimate comedy because it only ran for 5 seasons and there are ZERO superfluous episodes. Now we're besieged with series that go 10 or 12 seasons with the last half dozen seasons being colossal bores. 

TV in general is now like professional athletes who retire 5 years past their peak.",figurative
"Boring movie The reviews from professional film critics were surprising.

This movie is like if all the food products available in the kitchen (whiskey, sugar, salt, butter, ketchup, meat, bread, fruit and other products) were loaded into a blender and mixed - the result should be edible, but no.

The timing is not justified, the story is boring and predictable.

Weak lighting. Many songs are cut by dialogues and sometimes other music. The background music is just terrible in places. The acting is not impressive.

All genres of cinema are mixed and in the end nothing came out.

6/10 is the highest possible rating.

""From Dusk Till Dawn"" (1996) is more interesting.",literal
"I didn't expect to love it so much Like I try to do with all movies if I can, I went in blind. Rose Byrne? Sign me up.

I have no children, but I related so deeply to the main character. She's a therapist yes, but she can't help herself. She feels she has no choices and is afraid she made the wrong one. She can't escape, she's trapped.

The directing is so perfect. The pace is perfect. I love the creative choices that were made.

I wouldn't recommend everyone see this film, but it was definitely something that felt made for me. A movie for people who have repeatedly heard (or felt), ""why can't you just get out of your own way and do it?"".",literal
"mind blowing well few months ago i was not a big fan of TV series because i found them too long or boring or missing the punches that we want to see. but after watching few episodes of big bang theory i was completely hooked to it.the series made is more than a genius piece of art.the characters are really awesome and perform there part really well and Sheldon is really the winner and others also are.so in short ""a series full of laugh full of humor and full on entertainment thats all.well i hope the last season will be full of surprises and twist.congratulation to Sheldon for winning Emmy award .well thats all the big bang theory deserve a lot of success..",figurative
Fine True Story Series This is a fine true story series for all viewers to watch and learn. There was some room for improvement for the crew to create this true story series better and stronger. The cast selection could have been a whole lot better and stronger. This is an alright true story series for everyone to watch and learn.,literal
"Billy Bob Casting and Educational For me, ths series is magnetic. Why? The casting of BBT is spot-on. His take-it-or-leave-it demeanor and spurts of wisdom are qualities I'd very much like to have (but don't). I especially like his explanation of love: How true!!!

""Every romantic relationship you'll ever have will be a failure. Except the last one. Do you think this is the last relationship you're ever going to have? We want every one of them to be. You gotta love your way through the failures. You don't know you're in the last one until you're in it.""

Jon Hamm is the perfect wildcatter (and I hope he makes it). Demi is poised as his wife. I put both of them in the perfect casting category along with BBT.

Aside form casting, I genuinely enjoy learning about the oil business. While I'm sure Hollywood has taken license with some of what goes on, I find the business of the oil business to be especially fascinating.

As an armchair critic, I would have toned down the mother-daughter duo to be a lot more realistic. I would never agreed to the scene where BBT lights a cigarette after being doused by gasoline. While the director wants to make BBT appear tough, that scene made him look (I hate to say it) stupid. It's for that reason I gave this 9 out of 10 stars.

Going forward, I hope this becomes a multi-year series. Keep educating viewers. Introduce more realistic drama. It's time to bring in some politics -- drill baby, drill!",literal
"2022 Law and Order is good I don't watch much network TV but I like Hugh Dancy and Jeffrey Donovan so I watched the first of these and then the second. I thought it was great. I liked the original L&O and this is like that. One case a week, not serialized, formulaic, but you know what you are getting. The first two episodes have themes that are pulled from the headlines (Cosby, Theranos) and are pretty obvious. It is check-your-brain-at-the-door TV but very enjoyable. The writing is good. Dancy and Donovan are great. The only black mark is that Cameron Mannheim is on the show and she is just awful. I liked it a lot and plan to keep watching. Yeah, there's some politics, but there always was and people just need to stop complaining in reviews about woke this and woke that. This show is way better than the serialized versions of Law and Order - SVU, Organized Crime and that ilk.",literal
"More attention to detail I have watched the original NCIS since it started many years ago. Gibbs is one of my most favourite characters of any TV show ever.

Also I'm a sucker for a backstory/ origins story. So as you can imagine this was quite a big thing for me. There is just a few pieces of attention to detail that I think could've been done better, so far in the episodes I've watched Gibbs's house is not Gibbs's house from the original series and feel like Gibbs in this is about a foot and a half taller than in the original. Maybe would've benefited from Mark Harmon's son playing Gibbs. But all in all great watch.",literal
"Pretty good From a cinematic perspective, the film was almost phenomenal. The suspense and playing on it was wonderful. The shots were artistic and skillfully pulled off. And the acting was good enough that it shouldve been an easy 8. The plot is where they went wrong. There were three ways they couldve taken it and they chose the single worst direction to go making it all magical. I frankly find that lame, I wouldve appreciated either satanic elements or human monsters instead of the random path they for some reason decided to do. Worth the watch simply for the great cinematic elements but definitely dont expect as much from the plot. Its definitely different but not necessarily. In a good way, more of a swing and miss kinda way.",literal
Slow steady paced and intriguing Was going to give this a 7 because I thought it was a bit slow paced but in fact it adds to the suspense and the environment of the country. If you liked Longmire you should like this as well although set in 1971 its has overtones of Longmire and Zahn ( Ex Longmire ) is always commanding to watch like Clint Eastwood commands the scene when he is in it so does Zahn Tokiya-ku McClarnon who says a lot even when he doesn't speak. If you are a fan of Native Indian culture you will also like this . Enjoying this a lot . Only a couple of small goofs I picked up on but nothing awful .,literal
"Soberingly original Wednesday is amazing. I know of the legacy of the Addams Family, and even though the series is just a spin-off of a series that has been done and redone, I think Jenna Ortega and the cast of Wednesday really nail the whole mission of the series. The humor is relatable yet subtle. The characters are genuine but they seem to hide mysteries that I don't doubt multiple seasons will uncover. Jenna Ortega really embodies the macabre, grim, and valiant character of Wednesday Addams. Her character development is notable as soon as she steps inside Nevermore. I truly hope we get to see more of her and the Academy.",literal

"Downhill faster than a Cornish miner on a skateboard Does this review contain spoilers? Not really, because this season was actually spoilt by the writers long before it was aired on TV.

The books, as many know, jump forward about 10-15 years at this point. For some reason, the team behind Poldark decided not to put a bit of grey into the hair of Demelza and Ross and go for it, and instead decided to try and back-fill on the years that Winston Graham skipped. Perhaps there's a reason he skipped them - maybe he had a premonition of how boring season 5 would be when it aired on BBC1.

In this season we're introduced to Despard (who was a real person, although I don't remember him appearing in any of the Poldark novels). We also spend far too much time in London and far too little time in Cornwall.

Demelza has turned into a bit of wimp, people in Cornwall have mastered the ability to cross the county in about 5 seconds and there's some militant serving girl running around causing trouble in Cornwall - the only believable thing about Tess as far as I can see is her accent.

So no - no spoilers. Just a hint of sadness that such a good adaptation has been ruined by a bad attempt at sensationalism.",literal

"One ranch, six stars. I really, really wanted to like this movie. The three leads all seem capable of making this kind of flick in their sleep. However, the movie never gels into a real flow.

"A fun & frilly movie that fully celebrates the Lohanissance... Forced out of our building late last week due to an electrical transformer replacement, we decided to spend the blisteringly hot day with a double feature at Siam Paragon: ""The Naked Gun"" in the morning (absolutely hilarious); delicious ramen at Bankara (G Floor); and ""Freakier Friday"" in the afternoon. This 2025 sequel to the 2003 body-swap comedy with Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis continues the Lohanaissance and I'm fully on board for it. We've watched all her Netflix holiday movies, and it's genuinely great to see her back in fine fettle on the big screen. This update mostly hits the mark with energetic performances and a surprisingly great turn by Manny Jacinto in a role miles away from ""The Good Place"". It's a fun, family-friendly film that hits the nostalgia sweet spot; if you're a fan of either leading lady, don't wait for Disney+ and catch it on the big screen.",figurative
"Jennifer Lawrence Delivers a Gut-Wrenching Portrayal of Postpartum Reality This movie genuinely made me question whether I ever want to put my wife through pregnancy only because of Jennifer Lawrence's hauntingly raw performance on postpartum. The portrayal of Grace's postpartum experience felt so real that it left me stressed and uneasy the entire time. Lawrence's ability to convey such deep, layered emotion through even the smallest expressions is astonishing. Her performance doesn't just show postpartum depression, it makes you feel it.",literal
"Had potential to be a lot funnier, but still perfectly entertaining Good Fortune is a decently funny if heavily on the nose rags to riches / riches to rags comedy.

It follows down on his luck Arj, a victim of America's gig economy, who finds himself under the guidance of a less than qualified guardian angel. In an attempt to show him that untold riches aren't the answer to life's problems, said angel switches Arj's life with that of exceedingly wealthy venture capitalist Jeff. It's a Trading Places riff with up to date social commentary and the addition of Keanu Reeves as an angel, so there's a lot to enjoy.

It's a decently funny set up, although not entirely successful in milking all the comedy out of the scenario. The script is a little too obvious in places, particularly with the social commentary about inequality. I think it's at it best when the three leads are all on screen together. I'm a big fan of Seth Rogen and Keanu Reeves and they were both on fine form. I've not seen much of Aziz Ansari out of Parks and Rec, but he was pretty solid too. The chemistry between the three of them is great, so more of that would have been even better. Keke Palmer has a thin role which she fleshes out well, always shining when on screen.

Overall I had a good time with this movie. With three great leads and a good concept, it probably should have been funnier, but it still gave me a few good chuckles. Reeves, Rogen, Ansari, and Palmer were all fab to watch, and even if the social commentary was a bit on the nose, it still worked.",literal
"It Should Have Been 8, But.... This is an explosive action movie, I'll give you that. Jackie Chan is always great at hand to hand combat, no doubt about that. Veteran Tony Leung also made a stellar performance in every frame he's in. So why only 6/10 rating?!

It should have been 8, if not for the HQ assault action sequence. If your HQ police was being attacked by soldiers with grenades, assault riffles and the intention to kill all police personels, do you still ask them don't move before you shoot?! Really?!

And if you successfully caught the main villain, that you know has special skill sets in killing people with bare hands, would you handcuffed him in front, and not behind his back?! Really?! I mean stupidity has no limit, but this is just too much for me.

And my last complaint: if you know that the main villain always gets away from police ambushes, why don't you put a bullet or two to his knee cap, instead of always shouting don't move?! Really?! I mean really?! No wonder the main villain always gets away, because stupidity really has no limit.

Lazy writing 6/10.",literal
Absolutely Awesome It's hard to put into words just how much I love Animal Kingdom. It's such an incredibly underrated show. It's about J Cody (who's mother died of a heroin overdose) and has to move to Southern California to live with his Uncles who are 3 troubled brothers and their crazy mother who make a living doing armed robbery's and other criminal activities. Jay doesn't really like them because they never talked to or helped his mom (their sister) and he blames the family of her overdose. He gains their respect over time and become one of the leaders of the family. This show will have your heart pounding from all the excitement throughout the entire series. Once you start watching you're going to want to binge it as fast as you can.,literal
"Season One- So much potential- Season Two- wow what a bomb. Season One was current and interesting. It ended on a high note of rebellion and standing up for what was right.

"Still compelling after all these years I only started watching L&O a few years ago, and am hooked on the brilliant writing, acting, and direction that have made this show so popular for so long. Jerry Orbach is great as Lennie, and I was stunned to learn that he also played the voice of Lumiere, the French candlestick in Beauty and the Beast! His sarcastic one-liners never fail to get me laughing, and he and his new partner, Jesse L. Martin as Ed Green, have a good rapport and are believable as partners. On the ""Order"" side, Sam Waterston, Dianne Wiest, and Elisabeth Rohm are equally compelling. New cast member Rohm has gotten better as she's gone along; she had big shoes to fill as Angie Harmon's replacement. Because the stories are all driven by the plots, and not the characters' personal lives, it makes the constant cast turnover more believable. It's a testament to Dick Wolf and co. that such a smart, sharp show has stayed on the edge after almost 12 years! My only beef is I'm tired of hearing ""Ripped from the headlines"" in every promo. That, though, is a minor quibble. Wednesday nights wouldn't be the same without it!",figurative
"Wish it were better It's got all the ingredients but it falls flat and I can't pinpoint why. I watch it because it is not weird, fantasy, evil or superhero. It's average, not great, not awful . But I also play a game or read a magazine while watching because it doesn't keep my attention. We were really hoping it would be an 8 or 9, but I can't go above a six. Does it need new writers? More suspense? I can't figure out who the target audience is, teen? Young adults? Middle Ages? It doesn't even come close to shows I think it try's to stand beside like Will Trent and the Rookie, Lincoln Lawyer, Old Man, Blue Bloods, or Wild Cards, So Help Me Todd. It's just under the dried up NCIS. And as a side note, living in Kentucky, it was an insult to film in Canada and call it Lexington 🙄.",figurative

What another review calls a ""flower narrative style"" is not one of the ways that I care for a story to be told in film, but I do acknowledge that it has become somewhat fashionable in recent years. Additionally, the ending of the picture was as abrupt as it was deeply unsatisfying. I will not encourage anyone to watch it.",figurative

"The feminism of failure. The plot is about a strong, smart, beautiful, competent, loving, hard-working woman failing. But, the commentary is that even the most capable woman can be set-up for failure by the impossible demands on women.

I think only a woman could make this movie because, from a male director, it would be criticism of the protagonist. But from a female director, it's a criticism of the expectations.

Rose Byrne does an excellent job and is the unwavering center of the story. She is mostly unlikeable but, considering her circumstances, one can't blame her. (even if society does anyway) I had not seen A$AP Rocky before and he was a highlight in a supporting role, adding some needed lightness. But his character didn't really add to the plot development. Conan O'Brien did a credible job of acting but was a bit of a distraction. People in the theater laughed out-loud at inappropriate times just because of who he is.

The mystical side of the movie kind of lost me - something to do with the universe and eyeballs and vaginal canals. (I think) Was the final scene a birth metaphor?

The technique of not showing some characters seemed more gimmicky than effective. I'm not even sure what was the point.

In summary, this critique of societal expectations on women is a worthy effort. Rose Byrne's acting is enough reason to watch it.",literal
"Diet Predator This movie is worth a watch as the story is good along with the writing. I was reminded of how I felt when I had seen Star Wars: The Phantom Menace and trying to contemplate whether or not I liked it being a huge Star Wars fan. Predator: Badlands is like that movie in that it is another example of when a franchise just tries to get too cutesie and add humor to something that is not known for such. I was disappointed when I saw that this was PG-13 and not R. I wasn't disappointed with the movie as a whole but only in seeing that it lacked the bloody, gritty, testosterone-fueled feel of P1, P2 and Predators. I liked that the Weylan-Yutani storyline was included. Badlands is good if you want to take your kid to a lighter and more Disneyfied version of Predator before they're old enough to watch the original.",literal

"I liked it, but still disappointing So the idea of this movie had a lot of potential, and in some ways it exceeded my expectations. There were a lot of things that could easily be done poorly with this idea, and they did a good job in those areas, and that was surprising. However the general story was not done very well, and I'm not sure why. I still give the film a pretty decent rating because it was entertaining and did well with the magic, atmosphere, and payoff, but focus and the characters were off.

Don't read if you don't want spoilers.

To sum it up- what was done well was really good. The magic shows were pretty awesome. They were suspenseful, they seemed almost believable, they left you thinking about their tricks, and when they were explained, it was well thought out and interesting. The general ideas of the characters were pretty good, it's hard to really dislike any of them. The side characters and antagonists are especially likable. And the end reveal was cool. It's unexpected, it makes sense when you think about it, and complicated plans are sometimes good just because you have to think a little more. And none of the motivations were too expected or cliché, which I like in a story.

But that said, it has too many flaws to be considered anything better than good. It is not a great movie, it is only slightly better than mediocre. Here's, in my opinion, why: First, the focus was not a great idea. The focus should have been on the horsemen (it wasn't at all)rather than the agents trying to catch them. They are following someone they don't know at all, they haven't even met him, for reasons they are not sure of. They do not even know if their end goal exists, and at any time they could ruin their whole lives because of the scheme. Yet they continue to follow the plan. This would be interesting to follow, what is going through their minds through everything, how much do they trust it, how are they setting everything up. But that is pretty much ignored, instead a stereotypical romance between the agents is the main subplot other than them trying to stop the horsemen. And it was okay, but it was nothing special. 

The reveal, while I thought was a good surprise, the way it was executed wasn't great. The first half of the movie didn't really hint to it at all, you don't even know most of the story behind it. The whole thing (which was complicated) was explained in about 30 seconds. God forbid you had to go to the bathroom, you would be lost if you missed it. There was not enough set up for it. And the end was lame. We find out Rhodes is the leader and his motive, which was fine. But then his entire romance and relationship with the other agent was still pursued. Everything he said to her was a lie, as was his entire personality he made up, but in the end they're still in love without a second thought and he's going to make serious sacrifices for that? NO, just no. Which is also why the focus didn't hold up, because it was mostly pointless once you find this out. And plus, the ones who seemed like they should have been the main characters, the horsemen, are just dumped. Yeah, they get into the organization Rhodes leads, but then what? Nothing about what they do next is explained. Does this organization do anything or did they ruin their life for revenge that is irrelevant to them? Are there other members and if not will there be? This is all made unimportant, and the end just follows the shallow romance. Which is done in just about every movie, so not only is it dumb, but it's incredibly bland and typical. They didn't even try to set up for a sequel, they just ignored the magicians.

Oh, and this is probably just nitpicking, but there was a lot of unnecessary and distracting use of cgi. It just wasn't needed, and it didn't look very good. People could have easily done the majority of those effects for real rather than using computers.

I did like this movie. However it could have been so much better that in the end it feels hollow. The premise was good, the story throughout and plans were good, the characters were good, and they didn't use it to its potential at all. All movies have flaws, but these ones were too big to be able to love the film. It's fun to watch, I guess it's worth it, but I wish it had been better.",literal
"I feel like I'm the minority here Don't get me wrong, Jenna Ortega's performance was absolutely fantastic. She captures Wednesday's essence perfectly. Pretty much everything else about the show falls flat for me. The plot really doesn't work for me. It reminds me of the Chilling Adventures of Sabrina and Riverdale. It doesn't feel creative or inventive at all and just doesn't work for me. The whole ""school for outsiders"" thing plus murder mystery just wasn't a hit in my opinion. I also wasn't impressed with the casting of Morticia and Gomez and their relationship with Wednesday. Overall, it feels very YA so maybe it's just meant for a younger crowd.",figurative
"Chad Powers is funniest comedy since Old School Chad Powers is the funniest comedy ive seen in 20 years. Its a throwback to the 2000s comedy hits like Old School and Wedding Crashers.

Be very cautious, the mascot has absolutely no place in this tv show. Its an obvious attempt to insert wakey non-sense. But overall the show is gut-busting funny. Chad Powers gets my vote for the Heisman, of comedy.",literal

We get to see the fleshed out story of Gibbs before he was Gibbs and enjoy the original characters again. All the spin-offs were awful and the original is nowhere near the show we knew and loved. This one, however, gives us back the old NCIS and fleshes out the Gibbs character and some of the others as well. So what if someone is taller or shorter? That's a dumb way to judge a show. The cast does a great job and is very believable and comfortable in their character. Anyone who loved the old NCIS will like this one.",literal

"Guardians of the Galaxy, featuring Superman Maybe i was a bit too hyped up about this movie.

I was still hoping they would change his suit halfway through. Sadly that didn't happen.

Cornswet looks more menacing when portraying Clark Kent than he does playing Superman. It's not his acting skills it's the baggy outfit.

Not a lot of epic Superman moments in my opinion either.

Like my title mentions, this movie felt like Guardians of the Galaxy featuring Superman, A lot of Aliens, throw in a Kaiju for the sake of having an action scene, and to top it off a collector like prison to hold them all.

"Used to be a good series Criminal Minds started out really well. A little bit of psychological and sociological background being introduced to the general public to get a grasp on criminal profiling. The episodes were entertaining, the characters relatable yet realistically flawed. However from season 6 on, this series just spiraled downward. The cases lost the grip they had had on the audience, became dull and left you cold. In an attempt to make up for unimaginative cases and the routine that had set it when watching the team profile, gore and violence was increased and to even it out cheesy background plots for the characters were added. Sometimes it's just better to quit while you're ahead.",literal
"For those who've never seen the original Many of the reviews on here are complaining about how much the U.S. version copies the original.

I could care less that it's word for word from the original because this is all new to me. The actors portray the characters amazingly and I feel the storyline represents struggling families realistically. Each character will remind you of someone you know or have known. So for those who are like me and you've never seen the original, I absolutely suggest checking out Shameless, the U.S. remake. I look forward to seeing the rest of the season and maybe one day I'll even check out the original.",literal
"Exactly what Game Adaptation is supposed to be No too much diving into heavy drama, character drama, and all the stuff that, truth to be told, does not exist in video games overall, or more accurately said, there is no emphasis on that in video games mostly. Still, characters in Fallout show have more than solid development and arcs, often leaning or entering into drama, while kept a video game style, for this case true Fallout games style, that are still just a starting point in the first season, building for multi season series. Very similar is with the world building, that is immense, while paced to avoid being too overwhelming, considering how big the Fallout world is, and over what long time period it extends, while also is a story-telling tool, simplest example of that is the airship seen, arrived all the way from the East/North East US, with a mid-stop likely in Utah, ultimately all the way West..

I don't recall any nudity and there's no sex scenes, and that's not a bad thing.

The people around her watch with concern. The scenes jump around. That's it. How can a film be so bad when it has such good acting? Those who are curious should watch this film. I'm really curious. Did the director and producer watch the film from beginning to end before releasing it? If they had, they probably wouldn't have released it.",literal
"Highly recommended The Beast In Me is a gut-wrenching, masterfully acted psychological thriller that hooks you from the very first frame. At its core, it is a searing exploration of journalistic ethics, trauma, and the insidious nature of narcissistic abuse. The series is elevated by a trio of powerhouse performances, leaving the viewer tense and emotionally spent.",literal
"The Best NCIS since the original series. For over a decade now, anything that passes through the charismatic hands of Mark Harmon seems to be a sure fire winner and NCIS Origins is no exception. Although some of the characters on their own, at first appear to be a little flimsy and wooden at best, as the series progresses, they grow into their rolls and their personal back stories unfold we build an affinity with them. Like many programs in this genre, a small core cast doesn't over complicate issues and thus allows for each character to have deeper and more convoluted past. This is no more relevant than Gibb's tragic past which told through the use of flashbacks throughout the series.",literal
"A masterpiece of our time Severance is truly a masterpiece of our time, topping all the great tv shows and movies I've watched over the past decade.

I thought it impossible to create something this original in our time that's so utterly beautiful. The visuals, the acting, the directing, the freaking cinematography, the pacing, the emotion, the adrenaline... It's been years since I was this invested in a tv show, if I was ever as I am with Severance.

It's this feeling when you finish a series or a movie (or just an amazing episode after an amazing episode after an amazing episode) and you just know that nothing else you watch after can give you the same excitement and satisfaction. This is it.

My favourite show of all time, and it's not even over yet.

Thank you, thank you, thank you!",figurative
"Everything I could ask for,so far. First and foremost,I'm a fan of the franchise so this may be one sided and biased.

Don't care lol.

They've blown me away with this adaption(Please Try Killzone next).

From start to finish it did not disappoint.

As for the star of the show that's Mr Walton Goggins. I first noticed him in the Movie Damage,then sons of anarchy,hateful 8 etc.

The man has nailed his role as The Ghoul,and honestly,they could get a series dedicated to just him.

Locations-cast-wardrobe-visual and cosmetic effects all award worthy.

Hats off to Prime for running with it.

Potentially a long running series in my opinion.

I really hope we get a season 2,3,4,5,6.....but focus more on the wasteland,brotherhood,the rail road,raiders etc....",literal
"The Fantastic Four: First Steps Fantastic 4: First Steps is everything I was hoping for and more! After watching the film, I can confidently say this is a must-see. From the trailers to the first reactions, I was hyped, but the movie took it to another level. The chemistry between the cast is incredible, and they really brought these iconic characters to life in a way that felt fresh but still true to the source material. The action scenes are insane-the CGI is top-notch, and the powers are showcased in such a creative and visually stunning way.

What really stands out is how well they balanced character development with the big, explosive moments. You really get to know these heroes before the action goes full throttle, which gives it all more emotional weight. The pacing is perfect, never dragging, and always keeping you on the edge of your seat.

But let's talk about the post-credits scene-trust me, you need to stick around for it. The Russo Brothers directed it, and it's a game-changer! Without giving too much away, I'll just say it sets up Avengers: Doomsday in a way that will leave you absolutely buzzing for what's next. If you thought this film was epic, just wait until you see what's coming down the line!",literal
"We Have All Met These People A train wreck of characters....compelling, vile, and darkly hilarious. While we are led to believe one person dies at the beginning of the first episode, as the series progresses, you desperately hope that they all do. Highly recommended.",figurative
"Quality portrayal This is generally well done. I will say the Offerman casting as Chester A. Arthur, physically, is almost doppelganger like but his acting in this role is so out of place. All you can see or hear is Ron Swanson. His presence is hugely important in this series and its cringe-worthy at best.

The remainder of the ensemble is simply great. The casting is spot on other than Offerman.",literal
"I love this movie and for one particular reason. My husband watched it for the first time a few days ago (over the long Veterans Day weekend).  He then watched it for a second time the day after. He did not have a happy childhood, in fact some childhood memories for him are downright painful.  We have been married 11 years and I know very little about his childhood and what went on.  However, after (and during the second viewing), he began a waterfall of childhood memories that I had never heard before.  Of long summers of ""sandlot"" games with him and his cousins (they were known as ""the cousins"") they could play baseball and football and kicked the butt of most of the teams in town, during the movie his memories spewed forth as if they had been bottled up and just needed to be set free. His friend actually did the ""lifeguard"" thing, pretended to drown to kiss her, and like the movie they were all banned from the pool.  They also had a ""scary guy"" in the old house that everyone was terrified of (in fact so did I as I recall).  He assures me that this movie is as faithful a retelling of a childhood in the 60s as he has ever seen, and he revels in it.  I think that is the greatest compliment that anyone can ever pay a movie and I am grateful to the director for uncorking the well of my husbands memories for me to share.",literal
"What!? This is a strange series. The more I thought about it, the less I liked it.

Another Apple series that is one, two (or several!) episodes too long.

You can tell the writers were struggling to fill the episodes because of some of the ideas they came up with, especially in the later episodes - Evelyn's (Allison Janney) ""encounter"" on the beach???; Maxine's (Kristen Wiig) ""encounter"" in the ocean???; to name two.

My big question before watching the series was Ricky Martin?!? But he does fine, although not sure if it was makeup or CGI (or both) to make him look like he was in his 30's.

Having the great Carol Burnett and the cameo by Bruce Dern were plusses....not they get to do too much. Also a very poignant scene between Laura and Bruce Dern.

The ending does seem to be indicating the possibility of another series? But I doubt I will watch it.",literal
"Once you start watching Supernatural becomes part of your life Warning! Don't start this show if you aren't looking for a new obsession in your life. It doesn't take long and bam! You are 6 seasons in. This show will build up your feels and then run you through the emotional wringer all while being a supernatural action series. The description will tell you its about 2 brothers hunting monsters and saving people, but it becomes so much more. You really get to see Jared and Jensen grow up over 15 seasons. Their acting matures and they really grow into the roles is Sam and Dean. When Misha Collins enters as the Angel Castiel the show gets even better. The dynamic between him and Sam and Dean is great. Can't even begin to share the amazing actors from the series. Shout out to all the supporting actors that helped make this series epic; Mark Shepherd, Richard Speight Jr, Jim Beaver, Sebastian Roche, Ruth Connel, Mark Pellegrino, Felicia Day and Alexander Calvert. I could go on and on. Kripke really created something magical here. Supernatural has woven it's self into our hearts.

Also as far as Destiel goes, I will go down with that ship. Dean <3 Castiel.",literal
SO GOOD The acting from everyone is just so natural and the humour isn't forced. Loved it. Selena Gomez proving once again that there's nothing she can't do. Steve Martin and Martin Short showing their powerful dynamic once again but with the added bonus of the Gomez. 100% WOULD RECOMMEND.,literal
Another awful remake Not sure why the previous fantastic four needed to be remade but this is another awful remake that at least was barely better than the disastrous recent superman movie. I would avoid this as well. Not sure why up and coming directors and writers can NOT come up with stories that are entertaining and novel instead of remakes.,figurative
"Pretty Enjoyable Series! Season one was really good! I loved seeing the modern angles threw in there with the old world mob stuff.

But Season two hasn't been as good. It's followed the exact same script as Season one. There's a big bad that has to be removed. And then comes an arrest as the season ends.

Whatever happened to giving us some surprises? Every big move they've made this season was seeable from a mile away.

I seriously hope they give us some twists and turns for Season three, if it gets approved for another season. Because it's a fun watch. But not memorable. There's only been one episode that I wanted to watch more than once this season. Because it's all so predictable. And that really not good for a television series.",literal
Best show of all time. Literally felt like I was on the Truman show watching my own campaign. Whenever I had a criticism of them not implementing a facet of the game I was pleasantly surprised later on. Only thing I'm confused on are the water monsters? Are they murlurks? Don't remember them in the game but maybe I just don't remember. I seriously cannot wait for season 2 and then for this franchise to become 10 times what star wars became. There is seriously not as many imperfections as there are fingers on my hand. If they continue this series of bringing the greatest games to life they might just save the theaters🤣,literal
"Season 4!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I can't believe the first time I tried to watch the first episode of season 1 I didn't get into. What?!? I must have been having an off day.

I thoroughly enjoyed seasons 1-3. The kids are just perfectly cast, and work so well together. The adult cast couldn't be better. I couldn't wait to see what happened after the end of sn 3 (unfortunately,,, lots happened in the world, and really slowed things down). Then finally,,,

Season 4 brought everything to a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT LEVEL!!! First,, every episode was either a mini movie, or a full blown movie (as far as the run time goes). From the opening of ep 1, everything is different from previous seasons bc our group has become scattered. Joyce, Will, Jonathan, and El are in California now, while everyone else is back in Hawkins. While Jonathan has adapted to life in Cali (he's become a bit of a stoner along with his buddy Argyle, who drives a van to deliver pizza from the SURF PIZZA 🍕 chain), and Joyce has found a thriving new job where she can work from home,, Eleven has had a more difficult time. While still reeling from losing her adoptive Dad, Hopper, along with losing her powers,, she has become the target of ridicule and bullying from a group of California kids at school. At her age, it's tough for any child to adapt to theirs surroundings,, but for El,, the deck is always stacked against her. Will is also having troubles, but for him it's more of the estrangement from everything he's known, along with the realization that he's probably never going to feel normal after what he's been through.

In Hawkins, Dustin, Lucas, and Mike have joined a D&D club called Hellfire, by their ""interesting"" leader Eddie Munson (the quintessential metal head of the 80s). However, Lucas has also joined the basketball team in an effort to gain popularity. Max, on the other hand is still reeling from the events that took place at the end of sn 3 (Billy's death, etc). She's even been visiting the school counselor, and although she'd broken up with Lucas at some point, he still tries to reach her to no avail.

Nancy is still chasing down stories as a budding journalist while Steve and Robin toil away at the video store (we saw them get hired at in the last ep, sn 3).

Overall, life seems to be going okay in Hawkins,, at least on the surface, that is. The upside down is still lurking just on the other side,, and a great evil is making itself known to the teenagers in Hawkins. Especially teens who've gone through certain trauma,,,

I don't want to say too much (cause I'll give too much away),, but this season should win all kinds of awards!!! I can only hope that the last season will be as good (don't know how they can top this).

So much happening in this season. I really can't emphasize this enough. Your emotions will be drained after watching, but in the best way possible.

The big bad guy's name is Vecna, and he is one of THE greatest villains I've ever seen!! So evil, so scary, just incredible.

I'm literally on pins and needles wanting to see season 5!! Of course,, we'll probably have to wait til 2024 before they get it on Netflix,,, ugh.

P. S. Really!! If you enjoyed sns 1-3,, this season blows them out of the water several times over!!",literal
"James Bond meets Rocky Balboa with **** stunts For plot, xXx rates a 1.

For acting, a 0.

For action, a 10.

This movie is unbelievably stupid, but somehow people (including me) like it. Just watch it, take it for what it is, and go with the flow. Vin Diesel plays an ""extreme protester"" recruited by ""The Man"" to accomplish some vague mission. Don't get too concerned about the mission, or anything else for that matter. Anything resembling a plot is present only to justify the explosion or parachute jump or whatever impossible physical challenge the stunt-masters have come up with. Just be happy you rented this instead of paid to see it in a theater. Invite your friends over, have a few beers, and enjoy!!!",literal
"Simple, yet complex Deceptively simple, Fallout is ""running"" an intricate story, that is also massive, a submarine cruiser under all the yachting and surfing.

Season 1 fleshes out the outlines that, although done (very) discreetly, can be spotted, like a dark silhouette ""in the sea"" via high altitude aerial search done in the right place at the right time. Season also deals with seasons' own story and subplot that both get wrapped up by the finale, ending with the so called cliffhanger, that is actually a window into ""the future"", shortly said, a satisfying ending displayed and joined with immense potential that will deliver a high yield in season 2, that of course, if the ball isn't going to be dropped unexpectedly.",literal
Great pilot. This is being review bombed by b-hurt Brits that haven't even seen it. Never saw the original and I think this stands by itself.,literal
"This could be the start of something great. **Update, from 8 to 10 by ep 9. Next big hit show if sanity still prevails these days. Edit* Episode 9 S1 is one of the greatest TV eps I've seen from a serialised show, still telling the story but it shines so much brighter. Ben Stiller directed it personally. And deserves awards and recognition for it.

Only two episodes are out. So I'm going to keep this very short for now and update with a full review at the end of the series.

All I'll spoil, because I went into the plot blind before watching. Only going by the actors/director, stiller is still one of few unique film makers in hollyweird that can pull in great actors and decent budgets. This is series unlike anything airing and has great potential to be considered one of the greats of offbeat irreverent dark comedy series ever. Can't wait for the world building.

Just give this one a chance, so far it's not political or effected by the real world. It's a universe unto itself. And I love it so far.",figurative
This is an amazing show My only complaint about the show is that Emmy Rossum had stayed on throughout the whole show. I can't imagine why she would have given up on such a successful show.,literal
"Misinterpreted!! I usually don't write reviews, but I felt compelled to after seeing so many negative ones. My significant other and I went into this film blindly, and we ended up really enjoying it. I thought it was very well written, offering a unique perspective on what it means to be materialistic.

Many of the situations felt relatable, and I appreciated the film's thoughtful approach to questioning whether being materialistic makes someone a bad person. What stood out to me was the message that certain traits are simply part of who we are, they're not always something we can control. While the film acknowledges that excessive materialism can be harmful, it also makes room for the idea that there's nothing wrong with valuing certain things in moderation.

Ultimately, the most important takeaway for me was the emphasis on unconditional love. That's what truly matters.

All in all, I think some viewers went into this expecting a typical love triangle, when in reality, it's a slow-burn romance with a beautiful and meaningful message.",literal
"So... Freakin... FUNNY I'm on episode six right now and I am laughing my ass off! This is not middle of the road humor, it's mostly very smart. For many viewers, I think they will not appreciate it, the humor I mean. The cast is absolutely amazing. You have a gun! Yeah. With a silencer? It's what I had. My sides are hurting. The protagonist and her husband are an incredible comic duo. If you see something that you kind of wonder if you should laugh at, you absolutely should. There's no laugh track so the common Joe Schmoe won't find any of the humor. Nevertheless, it is so freaking hilarious! The story is pretty good too, but I'm primarily watching it for the humor right now.",literal
"Great pilot with some issues I was thoroughly entertained with the pilot of Hazbin Hotel, but one Issue I have is the abundance of sound affects. That being said, I love it, and hope to see more.",literal
"The screenplay is stunning I watched tons of great movies and series and still try to figure if I have seen a series that twirls in a flowing manner a very fun witty dialogue with very tough political approach of tough events (in this case, actually, the events are the scary ones that we are living right now, with a nuclear war being closer and closer any second) as this one does. Keri is a bonus, her acting being once again above any reproach. Prepare to laugh with all your heart, strangely enough, amid a tension difficult to bear. The screenplay is absolutely superb, so watching it there is a big chance you'll have an extremely enjoyable experience!",literal
"One punch in the face to haters... Now let's clear things up. What would be worse than unrealistic illogic slow-paced Animes? Absolutely nothing... But that's the case for some Animes. When I speak about ""One-Punch Man"", we're definitely speaking about the utter logic, realist conversations, understandable plot, logical events, and ultimate humor. Frankly speaking without exaggerating... It really deserves the title of ""Best Season Animes"". Madhouse nailed it with the awesome animation especially the ""last episode"", which was mind-blowing. Some people consider the power of Saitama illogic, and I don't blame them as I also had the same thought, but with the scene of 'Explaining the power of Sensei"" in the third episode, I somehow had further thoughts, some hidden secrets which might be proved up in the future in the Manga... 

The Anime never bored me, it has some really funny scenes. Madhouse did a great job following the Manga 99% and adding some scenes, although it removed some other scenes (which might be unnecessary) , such as ""Silverfang"" smashing meteorite pieces to protect Genos and much more.

What can I say more? This is brilliant. The ending was a little bit sad, but that doesn't matter if it gets a second season which is really really wanted and needed , fans want it, so Yusuke Murata has to work hard (as he said).

The fast-pacing of the anime was the original most-important factor that made the anime even more exciting, just like Manga, yet I still don't understand why people would prefer its Manga over the Anime.

Some roll-on-the-floor moments gave the Anime a special taste, it was one of other factors that make fans hooked to the anime, and by watching it, I was waiting so much for Sundays... 

After finishing the Anime, You feel the emptiness because you have no episode to watch ... 

Now here is the big deal, I've seen some 3 or 4 reviews here that the Anime doesn't deserve this praising and is totally a trash... Well let's be honest, those are the type of people that has a small angle of view, short view distance, towards the main crux of something. Now the question is, why?! why do they not like it?!

The answer is simple, the only argument they take is ""No Character Development, and no interesting story"".

Yes the story is the main factor here, it's essential and principal. But to all those who read Manga, the story is something bigger... Let alone how it hooks you from the first look. The story, being simple, on the other hand, containing interesting plots, is the reason why you just can't stop reading/watching Manga/Anime... The story isn't really ""mere"", it might be simple, and it's not really complicated. Just keep in mind the rule that the story is based on, Saitama needs no development, that's just how it is, it's the main idea here, but in fact, ""ONE"" started to develop it lately (MANGA), but this has nothing to do with our subject (OPM Anime S1)...So yeah, to a short-season Anime that didn't fill all the Manga, it might not be sufficient, yet it'll prove the points which will be shown up in the incoming seasons.

The beauty of this story, not only did it attract fans (The Original Manga), it was even re-drawn by Yusuke Murata, why do you think such stupid story would get this interest ? Answer it yourselves, easy thing.

All that's needed is a larger, different, further angle of view, to this story and characters, let alone what's coming next, it'll be ""E.P.I.C"".

I recommend this anime for EVERYONE !",figurative
"Worth a look-see It has promise. The writing is tighter than what I have seen so far in other new shows, The shots more polished. The actors seem at ease withing their characters. The pilot episode, though, had to do some heavy editing to get all the basic back story in (several parts of, uh, huh? What did I miss? How did we get there?) in the time it had. I am giving it a few more episodes to see where it will go.",figurative
"So Disappointing, Tubi needs an open class action Shelby Oaks is the kind of horror movie that makes you check your watch more than your pulse. Chris Stuckmann finally got his chance to jump from reviewer to filmmaker, and somehow created a movie that feels like it was stitched together from every spooky YouTube video your cousin sent you in 2013. The film tries to blend found footage, mockumentary, and regular horror into one experience, but the final result plays like someone spilled three different movies in a blender and forgot to put the lid on.

Sarah Durn actually tries. She shows up. She gives you a real character. She delivers creepy energy in scenes that would be chilling if the movie around her was not a confused pile of recycled ideas. She deserved a better script. Or at least a script that did not feel like it was written after watching a playlist called Top Ten Haunted Videos That Are Probably Fake.

Chris Stuckmann clearly loves horror. That part shows. What also shows is a tragic lack of originality. The movie clings to every tired trope. Creepy drawings. Dark hallways. Warning signs ignored for no reason. The dramatic sister storyline is AWFUL.",literal
"Science made Fun From pilot to finale a merry band of scientists make us laugh, cry, & every now and then feel smarter - or at least more attune to society's norms than they are. Leonard, Sheldon, Howard, & Raj welcome the viewer into their apartments and laboratories, and thus their lives - joined by their eventual romantic cohorts Penny, Bernadette, & Amy.

Embrace your inner ""geek"" and enjoy 12 seasons of science, laughter, & sarcasm peppered in and amongst awkward geniuses, action figures, & Bazingas!",figurative
"Pass At this point with modern shows, you're better off just rewatching the classics. From the character choices, to the story/character arcs or the ambience, it's just all bad. I mean, name a mainstream news social topic in the last decade and it's represented in the first episode which takes place in 2003. Save yourself the almost 8 hours and rewatch Stranger Things before the final season.",literal
"It's reacher lite I really wanted to like this show because Justin Hartley is in it, but it's honestly not that good. It's Reacher made for network television and everything that entails. If single case is a whole season in Reacher, this is a case a week. If something takes a serious turn in Reacher, this softens everything. And because it's Network Television, it of course has to follow rules of having every second person be some kind of minority, which isn't terrible, but it is obvious. First we have the lesbian couple, then we have the cripple Asian Man.

It's not terrible, it's just exceedingly average. The only reason it's a 6 instead of a 5 is because of Justin Hartley. Even ignoring my obvious bias, he's easily the better actor in the show.

The show has an overarching plot that in the first few episodes, fails to feel like anything worth sticking around for. There was no real big hooks for anything except some kind of vague ""accident"" and some kind of shadowy group behind the scenes, but nothing is shown except for a past trauma and I honestly found myself pressing skip anytime it was brought up. Hell, I found myself doing that through most of the show to be quite honest.

It has a pretty great premise which they could have done something really great with. Even in a Network show, it could have worked out a lot more interestingly. It just feels all too safe and sanitized. Like everyone was thinking about the ways they might terrify or hurt someones feelings and decided safe was a better investment.",literal
"FUN. Jurassic World: Rebirth delivers exactly what longtime fans of the franchise have come to expect - high-stakes action, chaotic dinosaur chases, and enough explosions to shake a theater seat. It doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it leans confidently into its formula, and for the most part, it works.

What surprised me most is how much I actually enjoyed it. While the story is nothing groundbreaking (and at times predictable), the execution is solid. The film features some truly impressive set pieces - large-scale sequences that are visually stunning and tightly edited. A few moments even dip into genuine horror territory, creating tension and dread in ways the previous films rarely attempted.

The characters are serviceable, though none truly stand out, and some emotional beats feel a little forced. Still, the film knows its audience. It's here to entertain - and it does just that. As popcorn blockbusters go, Rebirth delivers a fun ride with plenty of dino mayhem. Don't expect depth, but if you go in looking for spectacle and chaos, you won't be disappointed.",literal
"Between Silence and Sorrow: The Fragile Beauty of Hamnet What a beautiful movie from Chloé Zhao. The film follows the life of a regular family in a past era, focusing on their relationships and how they deal with life's challenges. It's about love, loss, and family bonds, but it doesn't hit you over the head with drama. Things unfold slowly and quietly - small gestures, looks, and silences speak just as much as words. The English countryside almost feels alive, quietly watching over the family, and the story shows that human emotions - grief, care, hope - are timeless, even across centuries.

It's admirable that Chloé Zhao had the courage and insight to write and direct this almost Shakespearian story. William and Agnes bring twin children into the world, and the loss of one puts them in an incredibly tragic situation. Yet they have to find a way to keep going - as much as humans can - despite the pain.

Hamnet captures both darkness and grace in one of the most unapologetically raw and profoundly moving films I've seen this year. It features career-best performances from both Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal, and it stands as Chloé Zhao's most accomplished work.

For me, it was a deeply emotional experience. The film doesn't scream its drama; it hints at it through tiny gestures, lingering looks, quiet moments, and family intimacy. You feel the characters' sorrow, hope, and concern - almost like you're living those moments alongside them. It's not an explosive movie; it moves you subtly and persistently, making you empathize with their loss and their struggle to carry on.",literal
"For the time it was a great film Weird Science was in 1985 one of the most wise film I ever seen. It was as simple funny thing, I mean the joke was not to hard understand.

"The premise makes no sense A disguised disgraced former QB walk on to a mid level loser college football program is a premise that makes zero sense. It's absurd by nature and not at all believable.

"An Amazing Journey of Endurance and Humanity To put it simply, The Long Walk is an incredible film - packed with emotion, constant tension, an unforgettable atmosphere, and easily one of the best movies of the year so far.

On the surface, the story may seem uneventful, but that's part of the brilliance. The film throws you right into this brutal world alongside the ""walkers"", making you feel like you're right there with them every step of the way. The dialogue is thought-provoking and layered with themes that give both the film and its characters real depth and leaves you with multiple resonating messages especially catered to this current generation.

The tone is undeniably dark with young men ""getting their ticket"" throughout the journey, yet through the main cast we see glimmers of optimism and kindness. That light of hope amid the suffering ties directly into one of the movie's strongest themes: the indomitable human spirit and the power behind comradery.

The standout element for me is the dynamic between Cooper Hoffman and David Jonsson's characters. Their friendship is packed with genuine emotion, making them both deeply sympathetic protagonists you can't help but root for. Their performances are nothing short of masterful and elevate the film into something truly special. Ben Wang was also a nice and fun addition, being another bright spot.

The cinematography also deserves praise as it adds weight to the atmosphere and drives the emotional impact home. If I had to point out flaws, the pacing dips slightly in the second half, with some moments feeling a little repetitive. A few of the side walkers are underdeveloped as well, though I don't think that hurts the film much - the focus is intentionally on the main characters and the narrative closely follows on their perspective, and that's where the story hits hardest.

The finale, though, is an absolute gut punch and leaves the movie on an incredible high note.

Overall, The Long Walk comes very close to being a 10/10 for me (Update: upon rewatch it was). A few minor issues hold it back, but nearly everything works beautifully. In my opinion, this is a modern masterpiece - one that will stand the test of time and is absolutely worth experiencing. 10/10.",figurative
"A spin-off that's as perfect as its original series Uh how to say....

Better Call Saul is the best series of the last 6 years, Perfect like Breaking Bad. (And El Camino, but that's another story).


* Perfect Cast
* Perfect Rhythm
* Perfectly developed characters
* Perfect Story
* Perfect Scenario
* Costumes, Perfect Makeup
* Perfect Cinematography
* Breathtaking story
* Episodes as perfect as each other.



* Perfect Dialogs
* Perfect acting
* Perfect Soundtrack


Better Call Saul is a masterpiece, the characters are endearing, breathtaking, they will be able to make you cry, laugh, make you angry, make you fear for them etc... Better Call Saul is TOO understated valued. This series is as perfect as Breaking Bad. Decidedly everything that is from the hand of Vince Gilligan or is part of the Saga Breaking Bad is perfect.

Despite the fact that this series is almost perfect, the series sometimes suffers from 2 or 3 lengths but the script and the acting always manage to overcome that.

Breaking Bad fans, even though Better Call Saul isn't quite as dark as Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul is still a golden nugget that MUST be watched.",figurative
"It was nice to see all the challenges It was nice to see all the challenges.

I was surprised by the high rates on IMDb When I found it was a lawyer play, but I indulged in the actor's acting as soon as possible. Many challenges, sudden accidents, and how the story will go on, that was fascinating.

I haven't seen three or more than three storylines come out at the same time in one episode. It was a good script absolutely with great words and suitable actors.

There were no unimportant views in this play is one of the most interesting things, and every actor had his own characteristics, like Jimmy's kind or humourous, and Kim's patience or concentration, even pride Chuck had his wide knowledge with something that he interested in.

Those accident stories were really touching me in my now tough time. I thought I would watch all the seasons finally.",literal
"Nathan Fillion never disappoints! The Rookie is one of the better cop shows on tv right now. Nathan Fillion leads a really good cast who all do a good job making this a show worth watching. Anyone who's seen Fillion in a show knows he never disappoints. This show does good job balancing drama, action, suspense and humor. It also shows how tough it is to be a police officer both at work and at home. Some of the negative reviews are from people that don't like that they take real world problems of today and apply them to the show. Everyone knows there are a thousand police shows to choose from but if you're looking for an exciting and original show then give The Rookie a try.",literal
"Too Many Episodes This is about four too many episodes. It dragged on for far too long, almost to the point that you no longer cared. The acting, for the most part, was pretty good. The script was a tad too formulaic for me. It is also a ""stolen"" plot from another movie. No one has any original ideas anymore and when they try to use others, the least they could do is improve it. It's not a horrible watch but I fell asleep multiple times trying to finish it.",figurative
"Great distraction With everything going on right now, this is a fantastic distraction. It's a nice break from the madness in the world currently.

Thinking about people who serve other people and the funny instances that occur within that circle is a great break from current issues.

Also, I'm so happy to see Wendy in another sitcom, she's got amazing timing and talent.

The chemistry between the actors is awesome. I'm pretty confident this can run for multiple seasons due to how relevant the subjects discussed are.

I'm really happy another sitcom was made that is not just a remake. It does have Scrubs vibes but only in the sense that it's good like Scrubs. It's a totally different POV and very relevant. You all have done a good job and should be proud.

Thanks for getting new stuff out there.

If you think about it, comedy is kind of medical relief due to the stress relief provided. Keep up the good work.

"Protect Keanu Reeves At All Costs This was a nice comedy with a winning cast. Aziz Ansari, Seth Rogan, Keke Palmer, Sandra Oh, and the one and only Keanu Reeves. I didn't even care what the movie was about.

However, I will say that there was a story and a positive message about having hope even in the crappiest situations and helping others whenever you can. At least that was my takeaway.

I thoroughly enjoyed watching Reeves play a clueless, albeit well meaning angel just as convincingly as he plays a skilled assassin. He is truly precious.",literal
"MMP, True Sunlight, and Cup of Justice Mandy and Liz have done a fantastic job bringing light to the darkness in South Carolina with their podcasts. I have been a fan from the original MMP.

All 4 of you make it work along with the interruptions from Luna and Joe Pesky.

"Honest conversations could have prevented much regret. Regretting You is a new romantic drama directed by Josh Boone, the director of The Fault in Our Stars and The New Mutants. The film is based on the novel of the same name by author Colleen Hoover.

Morgan (Allison Williams) became a mother at a young age to her daughter Clara (Mckenna Grace), together with her partner Chris (Scott Eastwood). Their relationship is often tense, and when Chris passes away, things only get worse.

When Morgan's sister Jenny (Willa Fitzgerald) also dies, Jonah (Dave Franco) - Jenny's partner - and Morgan try to navigate this period of grief and loss together while supporting their children. During these difficult times, they learn more about each other and about their deceased partners than they ever expected.

Because the film tries to quickly introduce the four friends - two couples - it can be hard to follow everything clearly. In addition, some events come across as somewhat implausible, as if they would fit better in a teenage drama, even though the story revolves around older characters.

These unclear and unrealistic elements sometimes make the film feel a bit tedious. For a film running nearly two hours, the screenwriter seems to have paid insufficient attention to the development of all the characters, making the whole feel somewhat unbalanced. Some questions raised by the story remain unanswered, making certain plotlines feel unnecessary.

The title of the film, referring to the regret over certain people or choices, could have been more impactful if the characters had more honest conversations and behaved in a more mature way.

Because of the unclear and implausible aspects of the story, the cast members don't always get the chance to shine. Most do their best with the material they're given, but many have delivered stronger performances in better-written films.",figurative
"I've watched this pilot 5 times. Zach Hadel has been a huge part of my childhood, and it was incredible news to hear he got a pilot picked up by Adult Swim. Upon watching, and I'm super biased on this, but it felt like something completely new. I can tell, based on what I have seen from both Hadel and Cusack, that this project means a lot, and it feels completely separate from everything else they've done. Seeing just how fleshed out they could make the plot, bits, and writing, while also giving themselves room to tease their comedic strengths, I felt like I was watching the culmination of years of preparation. Both creators have such a unique outlook on how to execute a storyline, and how to deliver a character, and honestly I felt like I was being introduced to these two animators for the the first time. I am highly anticipating what comes next, and who will be involved. With all the work that Cusack and Hadel have independently produced, it was painfully entertaining and impressive, easy to recommend to friends, and left me wanting so much more of the same. The only difference is, not these two formerly self employed animators have the resources to make a whole series!",literal
Incredible and Intriguing Good writing fantastic casting and a brilliant story . I'm hooked .,literal
"Was Much Better without Missy Peregrym I like the program but Mossy Peregrym as Maggie is laughable an agent who always needs her partner to protect her.

The show improved a lot when she left for maternity leave but now she's back its taken a dive again as they want her to appear tough like her well received temporary replacement but she's a joke!

Sorry but just kill off her character so she cant return and the show improves again, she's boring to watch and unbelievable i cant see how she's given top billing when she's soooo bad in the role.

Without her the script writers began to build the other characters and their dynamics which was great to see. It was also good because it was more believable. Instead of the always in trouble character who plays smarter than her bosses and everyone else but isn't capable of doing the role.

The Big boss played by Alana De La Garza would be more believable in the field.

Missy Peregrym the clue is in teh name GRYM!",literal
"This is just painful I liked Justin Hartley on This is Us, so I thought I would give it a shot. This show is so bad. I'm not sure if it is Because of trying to make each of the episodes self supporting, but the simplicity of the plots has been laughable. The characters are boilerplate, from the chiseled, indestructible lead, to the hacker dude that can access data in seconds that evidently Iowa enforcement can't find, to the multitude of attractive women with little depth all fawning over the lead.

This dude can somehow home in on people that have been missing long enough to require a reward being posted without a single stray thread to chase down or a single wrong turn in the expanse of the Rockies. Even more miraculous is that he has cell reception every time he needs it, and he never gets hurt despite being in fights in every episode.

I'm still trying to determine what exactly differentiates the roles of the supporting characters. There is no depth for any of them. They all seem to be caricatures of roles the writers once saw on other shows and the actors do nothing to add to their parts.

This would have been so much more watchable if they would have allowed each trek to span multiple episodes which would have allowed for a few red herrings and less predictability. Then they wouldn't have needed the road grader to flatten the plot and character development.",literal
"""Supernatural"" is easily one of the most creative, addictive, intense shows on TV If you have yet to watch Supernatural, now is the time to do it. Fans of lore and legends will eat up ""Supernatural"" without a second thought, and come back for seconds. From Demons to the Devil himself, this show has got it all. Here is a small introduction to the series, to all of you newcomers.

Supernatural is the story of two brothers, older bro Dean Winchester (played by the sexy, fantastic actor Jensen Ackles, who would be known from shows/movies such as My Bloody Valentine and Dark Angel) and younger bro Sam Winchester (played by the just-as-sexy-and-fantastic actor Jared Padalecki, known from his role as Dean on Gilmore Girls) being trained to hunt and kill supernatural beings by their father, John (played by Jeffery Dean Morgan of P.S. I Love You and Grey's Anatomy, on which he played the memorable character Denny). Years before the series takes place, John's wife, Mary, woke up to the sound of baby Sam crying over the baby monitor. She peeked into his room to see a figure,presumably John, standing by the crib. She left the room, but on her way back to bed she heard the Television downstairs. She walked down to see John watching TV. Noting this, Mary ran back up to Sam's room only to find a yellow-eyed demon standing over her baby boy. Seconds later, she was dragged onto the ceiling with a large, bloody gash in her stomach. John, hearing a commotion, quickly made it to the room, only to see blood dripping into Sam's crib and Mary on the ceiling. Before he could react, the room burst into flames. John had Dean take Sam outside while he tried to save his wife, to no avail. The house was destroyed, Mary was dead... and John had no where else to go. After that day, he swore vengeance on the Yellow Eyed Demon, and he took his sons along for the ride.

Flash forward to 22 years later. Sam is now in college, preparing for an interview at Stanford University to study Law. He is with his long-time girlfriend, Jessica. Late during the night before his interview, Sam awoke to a sound of someone in the house. After a brief struggle with the intruder, he realized it was his brother, who has been away with John for years. Dean tells Sam that their father has been missing for a while on a 'hunting trip;' a hunt for supernatural monsters, that is. After a very unexpected turn of events (which I will not state, for it will spoil some things), Sam reluctantly joins his brother on the search. The ""Supernatural"" series begins here.

""Supernatural"" goes beyond the unexplained, hitting everything from a paranormal spirit haunting a house to the war between God and Lucifer's army, along the way meeting creatures such as the hilarious and uncalled-for Trickster, a Valentine's Day Cupid, shape-shifters, werewolves, vampires and even angels.

""God? Does this show turn religious on us?"" No.

Starting in season 4, you are introduced to Lucifer, God and the angels. But, the thing is, it is definitely not what you expect from it. the lore of angels and demons is kept in parts and completely thrown on its head at others. God isn't necessarily the 'God' you know, and neither is Lucifer for that matter. They don't show the devil in the traditional way, with red skin, a pitchfork and horns. He looks like a human being. A very creepy and sadistic human being, but a human being nonetheless.

Which brings me to what I like most about the show. The effects. Many shows on television use a crap-ton of CGI (computer generated imagery) to make their monsters. Supernatural, although a fair amount of CGI is present, uses makeup effects and short cuts to get away from the bad-looking CGI beasts. Hellhounds, for instance, are invisible to the human eye. You can hear them and feel them, but you can't see where they are. Demons are large wisps of black smoke that enters a human to possess, at which point the eyes of said human turn completely black. The demons can hide the blackness to get into different areas of society without being noticed. These little alterations make the show worth watching. You don't get the cheesy looking CGI characters that most Sci-Fi shows do a poor job on due to budget and time. You get creepy, evil beasts and creatures that can scare the daylights out of you.

One more thing I ought to mention is the unfathomably amazing season finales this show puts on. Seriously. Yes, the storyline and the relationship between the brothers keeps you interested, but once you get to the finale of a season, you automatically want to watch the next. Every season has a perfect cliffhanger that will leave you on the edge of your seat. Summers are a very hard thing to get through with this show.

All in all I have to rate this show a 10 out of 10. I can't seem to find anything to fix. The acting of Jared and Jensen as the brothers is fantastic. Their moods and actions are perfect, and you could seriously believe they were real-life bros (likely due to the fact that they are best friends). The storyline is extremely well-written and perfectly paced. The dark and terrifying episodes are balanced out by the humorous ones that leave you laughing until your stomach hurts. Everything about this show is worth noting, but I can't say it all. I'll leave the rest up to you.

Now stop reading my rant about this show and GO WATCH IT.",literal
Outstanding Cast I love this show. I can't miss or stop watching. Love the cowboys. Best thing on TV. Once you start watching you can't quit! Wonderful 👍 love Kevin Costner and the whole family. Everyone is tough as nails. No wimps. Beautiful scenery and animals. The actors act like they're really related 😂 everyone can relate to that. Rip is so handsome and he doesn't hesitate to take care of a problem. No matter what Kevin Costner plays in he's one of the greatest actor I know. Beth what can I say that girl can kick some ass! Luke another handsome man and he's tough too. Jamie is kinda a wimp! Start watching you'll love it and be hooked!,literal
"gut wrenching, stomach turning, masterfully created I will start by saying this, I watch a lot of true crime. Whether it be 48 hours, or documentaries, biopics, you name it and i've probably watched it. That being said, I have yet to see something as jaw dropping and moving as this series right here. I am pretty numb to the brutality of all of these events because i've read about them or seen them portrayed so many times in different variations of media, so it is very rare for something to actually evoke a sort of emotion out of me.

Evan peters' portrayal of Jeffrey Dahmer is the best I have ever seen. I'm a fan of his work in previous projects (ahs, american animals, x men etc) so going into this I already knew I was in for a treat. But MAN. I genuinely became nauseous at the sight of the vicious acts displayed in this show, Ryan Murphy held back no punches, and I believe the show is better for it. The reality of what this sicko did is just beyond comprehension, and I truly believe that Evan and Ryan and the entire team involved have truly captured that. I am 4 episodes in as of now and am sitting in absolute shock.

This is the first show I have actually had to take a break from, sit back and just let it soak in the true horror of what i'm witnessing. I'm no actor myself so I won't say I know what it takes to play a murderous psychopath like Dahmer, but I can't imagine it's easy. Kudos to the entire production team, Ryan Murphy, and Evan Peters. I will ALWAYS be a fan!",literal
"Really Good Show After the first episode I was skeptical, dialogue seemed off and the actor who I do love that they chose to play the villain, gave a spy kids level of unserious to me. However from episodes 2 and ongoing the show has drastically improved. It remains fresh, fun, and contains so many mysteries within the bigger plot of the show, that keeps you intrigued, it's cool how you get to learn new little things about the team members under Dr. Watson, as the story line progress each episode, I think the only issue with the show is the villain role, but maybe they will go more in depth and the actor who plays the villain, can show me something new that will help me take his part seriously.",literal
If you liked The Fugitive... And The Shooter... this is a series about an apparently framed person using her own resources to prove her guilt or innocence. Pretty good for around 75% but then seems to drag out in the last 2-3 episodes. But that could also be a side effect of binge watching! 7.3 seems a fair rating.,literal
"Nurse Junkie-Jackie I have seen this show a couple of times and it is somewhat interesting. I like the side-stories they actually are pretty good. I am not a big fan of most shows and movies directed at women...but this one has more than potential, it has pace and seems to be well written and well acted. I guess the most irritating part about this whole story is also the most captivating. It seems Junkie-Jackie is always screwing up her life at every turn. If she is not main-lining, she is selling her 'woman-hood' for dope, and other odd (but real) stuff. The screwing around and drugs has been going on for a long time. I think it is time to make some changes (and we want to keep this real). She needs to dump her family, they are not important anyways. The only thing important to her is her job – very noble – just as noble as the executive who stays at work late at night with the sex-retary. Once troublesome husband is out of the way, she can now try a new way of getting drugJunkie-Jackie can do it all the old fashion way and peddle her femininity on the streets. Not only will she experience 'variety is the spice of life', but she could really get some excellent drugs. This show has too much potential to cancel.",literal
"Could have been a 10 except the weird stuff This series had a lot of potential and could easily have become ""the next Yellowstone"". Acting is great, and the storyline is interesting. Taylor Sheridan is very good at what he does. But, as many others have noted there are aspects of this series that are disturbing, and others that are annoying.

First, the annoying. Tommy Norris' ex is a nut, which might have been entertaining done right. In this case, however, it wasn't done right. There is nothing entertaining about this particular character. Her presence in the show is purely aggravating. In short, she spoils the show. Also, the long drawn out scenes with the oil men doing their thing to Western music is unnecessary and more than a little irritating.

Second, the disturbing. What's with Norris' relationship with his daughter? Something is more than a little off here. How they speak to each other, how she dresses and acts around him... I don't understand what Sheridan is doing. Whoever is responsible for writing this stuff is not right in the head.

I have watched almost everything by Sheridan, and there have been disturbing elements in a number of his productions. This one, however, is on an entirely different level. Disappointing.",literal
Such an epic show The best of what i have seen of Jeremy's works so far after Wind River. This show has its own dim atmosphere with intense events. No shred of boredom will enter while watching this series. The events are organised and well set in a really heated environment. Just mind-blowing.,figurative
"To Grinch or not to Grinch For anyone not enamoured by the spirit of Christmas, they will understand the cynic in disguise. Or you can just call him Grinch. Jim Carey gives out quite the performance as a villain/good guy. He kept the latter for his Sonic performance I watched recently. I watched this back to back with the newer Grinch (and saw on imdb there is another Grinch movie with Bela Lugosi? Another one for the have to watch someday list) and it made it obvious that this is not as good as the newer version - at least to me.

Having said all that, the movie is still funny and just for Carey it really is more than worthwhile. I guess some watch it every year, so depending how your emotional connection to it is ... otherwise I'd suggest go with the new and entirely animated one.",literal

"A Beautifully Shot, Half-Haunting Horror That Loses Its NerveQ The Black Phone 2 starts off strong - haunting cinematography, eerie sound design, and solid performances all promise a worthy continuation of the first film. Visually, it's stunning: the cold, isolated scenery; and sinister 3rd old camera shooting filming effect creates a creeping dread reminiscent of Sinister movie. The opening half feels atmospheric, tense, and emotionally grounded.

For about 45 minutes, I thought I was watching one of the best horror sequels in years. Then, suddenly, the movie loses its way. The pacing drags, the mystery dissolves, and the suspense evaporates. Instead of escalating, the story stalls, recycling ideas and substituting real tension with vague dream logic and exposition. What began as an unnerving psychological horror turns into something surprisingly bland.

By the final act, the tone nosedives completely. The last twenty minutes are painfully cliché - a Disney Channel-style finale that feels disconnected from everything that came before. The emotional ""big speech"" at the end is forced, cheesy, and utterly unearned. It's as if the film got scared of its own darkness and decided to play it safe.

Despite the strong craft - beautiful visuals, effective sound, and capable acting - Black Phone 2 ends up a frustrating near-miss. It had all the tools to be great but fumbles its momentum and dilutes its own fear.

A haunting setup ruined by a hollow finish, this sequel is like a phone call that starts clear and crackles into static. You'll admire its style but mourn what it could've been.

Verdict: Visually striking, well-acted, and atmospheric - yet ultimately lost, predictable, and disappointingly tame.",literal
"People must have watched a different movie This movie is very easy to follow if you pay attention to everything. Even though I figured out the ending, that doesn't make it a bad movie. Things make sense if you've paid attention throughout the movie. I have no desire to explain why things made sense to those who would like to disagree. It won't scare the pants off of you but is definitely worth the cost of admission.",literal
The GOAT This will be short and sweet. The Sopranos is hands down the greatest TV show of all time.,literal
"A Mystery at the Heart of a Retirement Community Although not particularly a great mystery series, it's a great showcase of some amazing actors who have been around for decades in the industry. This is a series that reminds audiences that you're never past your prime as the entire cast brings their A-Game. Ted Danson is fantastic as usual and he anchors the entire series. There's nothing particularly special about the overall series as it's a decent time waster, but you'll will wish the overall mystery was a little better handled. This being said, this isn't that bad and second season (which has already been confirmed) can expand on this premise in a big way.",literal
"Mediocre adaptation that fails to excel The movie is an adaptation of an rather obscure Korean black comedy. The source material may be considered a cult classic but seeing Begonia I feel like there was a reason it never got popular.

The film goes places well with commentary on the state of misinformation and self-victimisation plaguing our society. In what could have been a good movie about the dangers of such trends, it falls flat on its face with a ridiculous over the top ending. The adaptation is faithful but fails to exceed the original, and is an indictment on the lack of originality and creativity of the director.

The movie is carried by Emma Stone who is fantastic in her performance. Jesse Plemons plays the same character he always does - and I feel like he fails to capture the breadth of emotions required to generate sympathy for his character - which on paper should have come off a lot more sympathetic than he did on screen.",figurative
"I don't understand the low score This is so good. The plot is so catchy. It is like a perfectly assembled web with so many threads coming across one another and creating multiple contingencies. Of course, it is ""predictable"", granted that we all are assured the eventual ""success"" of the heroine once the show begins (and this is what makes it a comedy; comedy does not mean laughing). But the way the elements (the events!) come up together makes the details of this climb so exciting.

I love the characters too. Mary is my favourite. She is surprising, capricious, eccentric, beautifully radiant, and wonderfully weird and always endowed with that funny grace which suits her as a rich widow.",literal
"If I had a nickel for a Netflix animated movie about divorce.... In Your Dreams is the story of two siblings who find themselves in the dream world and hunt for the Sandman to solve their family issues while themselves stalked by a mysterious force.

The animation is a bit on the ugly side. They tried a semi-photorealistic approach with some weird stylization, making the characters fall easily into the uncanny valley. The story is alright, and the core problem isn't just magicked away which is good. But man those two kids can be annoying.

An alright reccommendation.",literal
Show's over! Turn out the lights! The show has lost two many of the the stars. Same with LA. Hawaii was terrible from the start. New Orleans is already gone. The NCIS Dynasty is over!!!! There's no-one left who can carry the show.,literal
"awesome anime So happy to have seen this. Its looks a bit goofy at first, but you'll love it.",literal
"A very uneven, drawn out series The entire series had some very bad flaws and had poor writing off and on. I am not on the Soprano bandwagon. There were so many side stories which were just a complete waste of time. The longer the series went on the worse it got.

I really dislike watching things which are not that great but some people insist are the ""best ever"" or ""flawless"". It's an attraction to people until they actually see it for themselves. This show had many parts to it which were designed to hook certain demographics to the show. What is funny is that these same people now state that if you don't get the show then you are not up to par with them. Excuse me but you are the ones who are manipulated and don't even realize it. 

The show was mediocre with some good characters and acting at times. There was some good writing at times as well. There were however some episodes which were not needed. This series could have been done much better in half the time. I would not recommend this show to anyone.",literal
"Excellent I was not sure I wanted to go back to the time of Jeffrey Dahmer however I turned EP 1 on this morning and I could not stop watching it. This series is so very much more than the gruesome reality of Dahmer. It delves into much, much more, equally disturbing facts / truths regarding the parents, victims and the police. In my view, the ugliness of the police is equal to the evil of Dahmer.

A standing ovation to all involved in this production as every aspect is sheer excellence.

Be prepared to binge this whole series in one sitting! It is truly that great.

Thanks to Netflix for producing some of the very best streaming out there!!!",literal
"so good, then not so much This show really plummeted in quality around season three and then never completely seemed to regain its footing. 

Rory and Jess got together way too fast and their relationship was a disaster. They didn't get together in a super-satisfying way, and Rory never learned to assert herself. That remained the biggest problem I had with the series, in fact. Rory never grew up from the whip-smart, sensitive, scared little girl who couldn't set boundaries and was terrified to detach from her mother. When she did finally manage to create her own identity for herself, it was an utter failure that led to criminal behavior and delinquency. What kind of a moral does that send--defy your parents and your only option is jail? This kind of behavior's hard to believe out of a girl as smart as Rory is.

The show spent two years at least building up Rory's relationship with Logan only to reveal that Logan was in fact NOT the one. Did anybody not know that? Raise your hand if you didn't. No? I didn't think so.

I sound so irritated because I spent so much of my time thinking about this show between season two and three. I was so eager and excited to know what would happen next. I thought the show and its triangle and the setup for season three were all excellent. I thought the bit about Chris was particularly well done. 

Then, somehow, it all went bad in ways I could not have seen coming.

Jess was rude and at times inconsiderate and selfish, yeah, but he became increasingly self-serving. He turned into the guy Lorelai described him as, the bad boy most girls have to go through in order to learn we don't want that. 

He was in fact still a step up from Dean, who had to be caught in the act before he would leave his wife for Rory. Somehow, she had allowed herself to become his mistress, at which point I lost all hope in the midst of my utter disgust and despair at the direction her character had taken. For a smart girl with so much potential...there's no excuse.

Jess and Rory ought to have been together at the end of the series. Tristan ought to have come back, rather than simply disappearing. Rory should have taken time to find herself instead of hopping into Jess's arms straight from Dean's car. This show's writers have some learning about real life and how real people behave to do.

Perhaps this is how some women behave, but they are not women I want to know. They are also not women I want broadcasting into my living room once a week. Hence, I stopped watching after season three.

Paris was the only interesting character left. I figure I'll catch that actress on a different show and be done with it.

Oh, and one more thing? No woman who is that skinny can eat hamburgers, fries and a shake once a day every day without working out and stay looking that good. It's impossible. No one has that kind of a freakish metabolism. In this age of obesity, thanks ever so much for giving your viewers yet more incorrect ideas about life.

Note my sarcasm.

By the time Luke and Rory's Mom finally got together, no one cared anymore. Their relationship was well-written, I thought, though I seem to be in the minority among viewers. It didn't matter. No one cared. It took too long.",figurative
"This show is an IQ test This TV show is a mess.... It is a literal assault on your intelligence.  .Characters pop in and out of existence for no reason. The producers were trying to be ""clever"". Keeping the audience guessing, but never coalescing into a coherent and logical ending.  It's as if the writer(s) placed possible suspects names in a hat and pulled out the words (random person from the past)... EYE ROLL MOMENT.  .People know each other with NO explanation at all.  .FBI Agent has book that points to him being the killer, yet agent has no affiliation to accused.  Lead actress is homeless, disheveled, injured, bruised in one scene.  Has make-up on and hair curled in next.  .People are driving cars that are only found in Canada and not legal to drive in the US.  . Mass grave found, only one person is identified. Mass grave not part of original back story.  .Brother into snuff films, references names of deceased females; just into kinky stuff.  .Lead ACTOR tried hard to show he's watched every Ryan Gosling film and that he can imitate his facial expressions.  .BPD officer is 100% cliche', he's a caricature, no substance at all.  . And the ending.... UGH! what a total mess, leaving it ""open"" for season 2.  .PLEASE DO NOT MAKE A SEASON 2.",figurative
"Not Good Only giving this 3 stars because Seehorn is always good in anything she appears, but the show itself is typical of most streaming TV: slow, meandering, tedious and pretentious. I don't mind a slow burn, but this show is pure style over substance. Nothing is intriguing enough to keep you invested. It has all the hallmarks of a VG show. Nice looking cinematography with a lot of window dressing to purposely slow down the pace to mask the fact that absolutely nothing is going on. The dialogue is over the top and has this air of gravitas like most modern cinema and TV, desperately trying to wow audiences ""omg did she just say that?"", but actually sounds hollow.",literal
"action packed thrills and great stunts This film was filmed with action and stunts, many of which vin diesel did him self which is pretty impressive. He played good at the lead character, and asia argenta as the beautiful yelana were a good match. I was surprised seeing jackson in this too which was nice. The cameos were good aswell. The plot of mixing stunt sports with the hunt for a bio weapon I liked and thought it was intergrated well. Altogether a pretty good action ride.",literal
"Doc surprised me -- I am thoroughly enjoying it so far! True, I'm only 2 episodes in so far but it's really grabbed me. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that, too, what with the absolute deadzone of new mainstream media shows clogging up the airwaves, sprinkled between the frustrating (I HATE THEM) reality pap. It could still go off the rails -- I'm a very tough taskmaster on TV/movies -- but, watching the 2nd episode last night, I realized I was hooked. Only character I find ill-cast is Scott Wolf. Since it's filmed in Canada I felt it was probably going to be a good replacement for another of my local favourites (and I'm Canadian) ""Transplant. Fox is making a number of good shows right now. WAY better than CBS, NBC and ABC which are mostly so predictable I can spot the ""bad guy"" the minute they walk onscreen. Doc offers lots of twisty secret pleasure kinds of moments as you get to see her interact with her younger boyfriend doc, but since she's lost her memory, she has no idea. And he's staying mum on their previous relationship. While she's still in love with her husband because they were married at the time she last remembers. Anyway, looking forward to see how a number of interesting plot points play out. I'm actually a bit miffed it's not on a streamer so I can binge it.",literal
"Beautiful music and animation but hollow on the inside. The music, the visuals, and the character designs were super cool.

Unfortunately, the story is extremely rushed.

I usually prefer shorter movies however this one needed a lot more time to spread its roots before trying to bloom.

Despite the morale of the story and the conclusion being pretty obvious and simple, it could have felt a lot better and more impactful if we had more time to understand the other girls, the demons etc.

Feels like so much has been cut out and this could have been much better.",literal
"Just me or is season 2 just a bad repeat I LOVED the first season it combined all the needed elements of drama and intrigue characters you cared enough about to see what happens to them ... Season 2 you can't just push repeat and hope it sticks.

She goes back to the guy who sold her into slavery (really) after he was the only guy ever to do anything real for her.

He walks all the gangsters voluntarily into prison??, He wanders around into mobsters' lairs beating them and disarming them, and they don't get wise to it... It is all very Silly.

It must be very hard to keep creating new stories and sending them into drama and danger without stretching credibility however how did they get it so right in season 1 and completely wrong in season 2?",literal
"Three Wisest Men Tyler Hynes and Erin Karpluk are by far my favorites in these movies.

There quirky chemistry with each other is off the chart. But this movie did not take advantage of this at all.

I believe they make a movie with the two of them where they do move San Francisco and their wackiness is on full display!",literal
"Workplace comedy! Everyone loves a good workplace comedy and we need more of them. This one isn't peak but I think it will come together with time and chemistry. Set in Hollywood because of course it is. Had a great many of chuckles in the pilot and the second episode just got better. Hope they renew it, definitely has potential!",literal
It's a decent movie Well to start we never had a great fantastic four movie so far for some reason so compared to that this was an improvement but that doesn't set the bar high. The movie has great visuals and a soundtrack and actors are decent in their roles. The movie felt a bit soulless at point and sometimes just jump from scene to scene bit too rushed I felt. Also didn't really dig the action. The action scenes are way too short and don't really give time to appreciate it. It's strictly average and shows Marvel still can't replicate the fun we had in old marvel movies.,literal
One of my favorites Some of the best acting I've seen. Though I knew the story of the Murdaugh family I was still entertained by the way it was told in the series. Whoever did the casting is a genius. I can't wait for the next episode and the next and the next. Congrats to the cast and crew for an absolute success. Thumbs up.,literal
"Wow! Epic, stunning, genius movie musical! Advance screening of the new movie Wicked (part1): Wow! Spectacular, creative, wonderful dancing and singing and sets. Almost like old MGM massive musical movies from the '60's with CGI. I loved the brief cameo of Kristen Chenowith and Idina Menzel singing with Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo. The latter two leads have great chemistry together with wonderful voices and acting. A sweeping 2.5 hour epic that justifies its two parts. Incredible costumes. Michelle Yeoh is wonderful as Madam Morrible. Some changes from the musical are both necessary and wonderful additions to the movie. Make sure to see it when it opens this weekend!",literal
"Decent Into Insanity Interesting premise but too many threads. Is the story about a hard-to-locate company that makes office chairs? Or is it about a not-very-likeable guy who is promoted, proving ""The Peter Principle""? Some guy who easily cracks under pressure, to the extent of hiding under his desk? Or a guy who obsessively latches onto minor questions, obsessive-compulsive disorder? Or just an unpleasant guy it's difficult to care about?

My takeaway is that the guy is like a bull in a china shop with no self-awareness spiraling into insanity. Not my cup of tea.",literal
"Wow! This might be the best thing I've ever watched on TV. The acting is incredible. The direction is amazing. Scripts are believable and exciting. The pacing is insane. I found myself holding my breath in anticipation.

Noah Wylie heads up the masterclass. His lead character is amazing and the delivery is both believable and tear-inducing. You marvel at him in one instant and you're close to tears with him the next. It's an amazing performance that HAS to win awards.

And the show has awards written all over it.

Be careful, though. It'll hit you right in the feels. You'll be that invested.

Simply amazing TV.",literal
"Great Crime Drama Criminal Minds shows the viewers that it takes wits to beat the bad guys. The common link between CM & CSI is that the question of ""How?"" is always more interesting.

The only difference: CSI centers around physical evidence gathering & collecting the pieces to solve a puzzle.

Criminal Minds involves more psychology & sociology. We, as viewers, want to know what makes someone tick as a way to prevent crimes from occurring again.

Another reason why I enjoy this showed so much is how the characters put their expertise in play to solve some of the most twisted people around.

As casting is concerned: Patinkin is perfect as Jason Gideon. If you think about it, he's more like a professor citing famous lines from Einstein, Faulkner, etc.

When I first read those lines, it didn't make sense at first, but as you watch each episode , the lines that Gideon cites has more meaning to it.

For example: Einstein: ""Imagination is more important than knowledge.Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world."" Gideon is saying that the human mind is the deadliest weapon of all, & we are capable of anything & everything of achieving all kinds of possibilities.

In conclusion, Criminal Minds is the kind the of show that anyone can enjoy.",figurative
"Not exactly smart entertainment, but fun. Look, I'm not going to pretend that this is some sort of masterpiece. Though it is basically another ""generic action flick"", the twists that they add to it make it worth watching. The way they incorporate their ""recruitment program"" into the movie is fun and original, and though Vin Diesel doesn't really ""act"" in it, it's a lot of fun to watch. It has a few suspenseful plot elements, and the way they incorporate his status as an extreme sports star (not a spoiler, it's in the previews) into the way he conducts himself as a secret agent makes it more believable. Ever think about some of the stunts that go on in an action movie and wonder, ""Okay, exactly WHY would this particular person know how to do that?"", because it seems completely unlikely that there would be some sort of training program for the stunt they just pulled off? This movie doesn't have that, because whether he's on a motorcycle, skis, or whatever, you can believe that an extreme sports star would be able to pull off what he's doing. Though the plot is as unrealistic as most movies of this genre, the stunts are a lot more believable than you'll find in most.",figurative
"Get show but annoying ex wife Am I the only one who fast forwards when Ali carter is on? I have no issues with Ali as an actress she does it great....but that character just annoys me. It makes zero sense and disrupts the story.

It's like it's just eye candy but instead I just want to scratch my eyes out.

As for eye candy daughter isn't that bad. I can understand it. Yes your daughter is entitled and pointless but you can't kick your daughter out as it's your dam daughter and with love her no matter problem she is.

The son right now is doing a great job

The female attorny was dam brilliant ""jaw dropping as she put that guy in his place""

The workers aren't to bad. The conflict is good but same crew makes it a bit stupid.

I'm sure the show will continue to entertain.",literal
"Finally! Something good colorful happy, real world. people and issues. I recommend this to people who loved the beatljuice cartoon. Before parents show it to young children watch and make sure your ok with the content. Genuine comedy. No slap stick fox Sunday night cartoon comedy. What a relief to watch new content on the internet as a TV length program. 6m views already, that's more than regular TV views now a days. Time for more shows like this to change the way we watch TV. This break out crowd funded show should not be missed. Even the music isn't annoying, at first when I saw music coming I was nervous it would ruin the show. Many shows have tried to add original music but it misses the mark a lot of times. The music in this episode helped the story, with a catchy beat and easy to hear words. I didn't have to rewind to hear what the characters were actually saying. Some people might be upset a out the LGBT references and drug references but it's 2019 and this is how we should all be getting along. There was no pointng out a Manish monster wearing women's clothing, it was just accepted. Drug use and the reality it isn't easy to quit cause u sometimes have fun is a reality and snows the consequences of using also. In all give it a look enjoy 30 min of something new!",figurative
"Four great seasons Seasons 1-4 were very good although season 4 did start to drag with all the Smurf flashbacks.

Season 5 was a mess that was basically two different shows blended into one and moving at a glacier pace with nothing much ever happening. A young Smurf spinoff show could probably work on its own but totally does not work embedded into this show.

It's been a great trip but might now have jumped the shark.",literal
"The original cast made the show. They have gone now, time to say goodbye. Tony Dinozzo (Michael Weatherly) was the character that really made this show come to life for me. He was interesting, a film buff and very unlike the typical gungho cop you get in shows like this. 

When he left (and I know there were characters leaving before him) it left a huge gap that the new stable of characters just can't fill. In fact there have been a few newbies come in since he left and they are all so boring I cannot even think of their first names. 

Now Abby has also left and so we really only have Jethro, Ducky and Probie left. Probie was always a supporting character a good straight man to Dinozzo. Jethro worked well with the original cast but now looks bored but happy to be raking in the cash. Ducky is still interesting but not on the show as often as he used to be. 

And the others? Who cares.",literal
"Still like the show, but things have to change I like the show and I've watched every episode over the years. I do have feedback on the new season and this is the same feedback I have for the last season. The Olivia Benson character is turning into whatever male in authority that we all are frustrated with. Her character thinks she has to have the ultimate answer for everything. She acts like a freaking man. I can't believe that Mariska Hargitay doesn't see that while she shows extreme sympathy to women of sexual violence or any violence at all the rest of the time she conducts herself like a man. She is the only authority on the issue in this world and that is absolutely what we're trying to get away from with men. It's not working for me.",literal
"OMG ! I can say many things about this show, or even give a long review many of you may not be interested to read, But I can say one simple FACT, This show is a goddamn classic MASTERPIECE.",figurative
"Interesting but not enough I surprisingly got hooked the very first episode. Not gonna lie, my partner and I binged this show in one night. I could care less about the main character being trans, it didn't affect the overall story or performance.. although did not expect that vivid scene of Mae being yk what by the wife, just not needed to be portrayed. Other than that, I was rooting for Mae's character, I thought at first bad acting but I kinda started to vibe with the awkward, monotone act. The ending was awful. It suddenly shifted and made no sense as to why that white friend stayed, and would have loved to see that school get completely shut down. I thought Mae's character was gonna leave with the baby, really disappointed.",literal
"Cardboard acting. I actually liked the plot but it was so hard to get past episode 1 due to this issue and also the script. The conversation flow felt like theyre reading off a teleprompter, quite robotic and sorta unrealistic. Facial expressions were either overshown or underwhelming.

They should have at least spent extra budget for hiring experienced actors as the lead. If not, then just train Alyvia and Alex Dempsey more before shooting them. I especially think these two were not ready to be leads yet.",literal
"Masterpiece Spoiler free review of this and i am utterly shocked by how good this show was. Season 1 started off slow so dont drop the show so quickly, this show becomes one of the greatest shows of all time and my favourite show.

It really dives deep into Walter Whites character and his development throughout the show. He starts off as a boring high school Chemistry Teacher with cancer to a Drug Lord Millionaire. Another great part about this show is its Cinematography the shots and camera angles placed by Vince Gilligan are gorgeous and beautiful. And dont get me started on the acting, the acting for this show is absolutely amazing and gut wrenching. To Parents: DO NOT WORRY, This show isn't bad for children who are 13+ however, make sure that your child is VERY mature going into this show. Most of the sexuality is in season 1 and is almost completely gone by season 3-5 in fact, Season 5 has no sexuality, The Gore however is quite frequent and sometimes graphic Mostly in season 1 and 4 with Season 4 Eps 1 being the most brutal eps in the show but you can just close your eyes if you cant watch it. Season 5 is the most saddest season and has loads of intense scenes. This show might be a little Mature for the younger audience but it tells a magnificent story and you should definitely give it a go.",figurative
"Location Location Location This is a good show with some twists and turns in it but for some reason, I don't know why it bothers me so much, but why can't people get the locations right?

Yes, I understand that film crews can't always travel the country and shoot at different locations all around the nation but if you are going to say you're somewhere then at least make the place look similar to where you say you are. For instance in an episode they say that the location is Pine Bluff Arkansas and where they are shooting isn't even close to the region. I understand it's fiction but if you're going to be telling a story then just make up a towm or city name. Don't try telling us you're somewhere that you're not, your viewer's have a little more sense than that.",literal
"Another entry in Disney's line of tourism commercials Just like ""Brave"" and ""Frozen"", this movie feels like a tourism ad for a substantial part of the time (and indeed, Disney partnered with Hawaiian Airlines to promote the movie, despite its ecological message), but delivers some decent plot and character development in between, alongside the usual stunning animation. Should get a prize for the most under-developed sidekick characters ever.",literal
"Not as bad as I thought it would be, but... When I found out that they were making an American version of The Office, one of the most heart-stoppingly good situation comedies, I thought, ""Why?"" I thought that it would be simply awful, like many Americanised shows. I found a link for the Myspace pilot. I started it, and it actually wasn't too bad. It really wasn't. I really enjoyed it. It was really good. One of the funniest bits was where Mr. Brown got the little card that said ""black"" (I won't go further than that, and the show didn't go too far into that anyways, but it was really funny just seeing that). To be honest, it was one of the most excellent Americanisations of a British shows. There were some great moments, like the east Indian woman coming back into the room and the boss going ""Hallo! Welcom to my stor! Vuld yu like sum gooki-gooki? Tri my gooki-gooki!"".

However, I felt much of the time that the characters were rather lifeless. You couldn't really feel for them. They weren't as deep or real as the original BBC characters, to whom you could relate even if you'd never been in an office. The boss just wasn't good enough for what the original set the bar as (the David Brent character going down in history as ""most annoying boss""), although he tries, really hard. One never really gets into Jim, who was originally Tim (good one, NBC). Pam (aka Dawn) isn't quite as well-played as Dawn's character. And the hideous syncophant (Gareth) has been replaced by a simply-annoying Dwight.

But what really makes the show a lifeless slug is the running time, which is barely twenty minutes. The whole thing seems far too rushed, and there just isn't enough material to satisfy the typical BBC-Office-watcher. The jokes aren't quite as good as the original, and there are so few of them. The pilot never really goes into anything, although the real show may prove different. However, a good feature in The Office is that NBC didn't spring for a laugh track, which would've ruined the show.

All in all, The Office is a feeble shadow of its British counterpart, but it still manages to please.",literal
"Boring. Honestly I can't imagine that movie was made. The plot is so obvious and uninteresting. There was not chemistry between the main characters. I really want my time back.

Kreuk is a B actress and she plays the same character as she always does. But what's up with that ridiculous choice of clothing? It's like they were looking for a Church lady look. It's terrible.

Sutherland seems more comfortable in the role but it's still feels flat. Like he thinks his last name would do the trick. James Cromwell is under utilized. He does a really good job. But the dialog that he was given was just horrible.

So if you like a predictable, boring movie, this one is for you.",literal
"Wonderful Series! I have no idea how this series slipped by me. I stumbled across it and binged the entire series. I've watched it quite a few more times. It's on repeat for me just like The Last Kingdom and Outlander are.

I've never seen any of the actors in this series in anything before. I loved the characters so much that I've found more movies that Aidan Turner and Eleanor Tomlinson are in. They are fantastic actors.

The drama, the struggles, everything that the characters go through really keep you glued to the story. I just loved the chemistry between the characters Ross and Demelza. They really made it look so believable. Every actor in this show did an excellent job!",literal
"Brotherhood of the Wolf is one kinky French mix Brotherhood of the Wolf is what happens when you mix a cheesy violent American martial arts movie with an elegant period drama. You get a curious mash-up. Given a random test audience, this mash-up will probably result in half the people falling asleep from boredom, a third of the group trying to understand what the hell this movie is even about, and the remaining third will have their eyes enthusiastically glued to the screen, not willing to miss a moment.

Taking on the semi-historical Beast of Gévaudan, the film tells the story of two guys hired to help find a beast believed to have caused a series of brutal killings in the pre-revolution France. The film straddles the line between the elegant realm of French society and the spooky realm of the wild forests. The story starts strong, even if it is treading old ground, but it starts to weaken towards the end. In fact, it feels like the peak is about 2/3 of the way through the film and, from then on, the pace slows down, as if the creators were starting to get tired of the whole affair.

This causes the resolution to be not particularly exciting and, considering the full version of the movie is almost 3 hours long, it makes one realise that this movie could've used better editing. Nonetheless, the ending is satisfying.

Director Christophe Gans has a checkered and rather small portfolio, but this is arguably his finest work. The cast is a mix of international actors, reflective of the hodgepodge nature of the whole production. Samuel Le Bihan in the lead role is a fairly prolific actor but not known outside of France. His partner in the movie is Marc Dacascos, of all people. I'm telling you, it's like they took the French and the American cultures and smushed them together and made them kiss. Speaking of smushing and kissing, we have Monica Belluci playing a courtesan, and this is a French movie, so you know what's coming. Say what you want, but she is a professional at delivering sexuality and that's what she does. Vincent Cassel conveys a subtle menace as our primary antagonist, but also humanity and pain. In case you're wondering, Vincent Cassel is that French actor whose face you recognize but can't recall if you've ever seen him in a movie before. He is the go-to guy for French action movies, which this is.

The special effects are acceptable for a movie made in 2001, but they are used sparringly, with the movie relying on the performances and the choreography of Marc Dacascos to pull the movie through. The beginning focuses on different characters, helping the viewer establish who is who, which is important in a movie with so many characters and conversations. The theme of a pack of wolf is present throughout. The film mixes still shots of 18th century France with dark shots involving action or horror.

It will take a certain kind of viewer to enjoy period sci-fi thriller. There are flaws in the plot, but in general, it succeeds in keeping you connected, and at the end, you're interested enough to see the whole thing again in order to understand it better. The actors are good and the film has style.",literal
"XXX DELIVERS EXTREME FUN! PUT YOUR BRAIN ON HOLD AND ENJOY! Have you seen the trailer for this film??? Then forget about reading my review or anybody else's for that matter!  It doesn't take 2 brain cells rubbing together to know what you are going to get here, and you get PLENTY of it!  This was not a typical movie choice for me (my guy's turn to choose), but I had some idea what to expect and I think you do too. Having said that, here is a BIG SURPRISE - this was one of the MOST FUN, simply enjoyable movies I have seen in months, maybe a couple of years!!!  This film is wonderfully unpretentious.  It doesn't take itself too seriously, and we shouldn't either.  Does XXX provide deep intellectual insights, an elegantly constructed production with soul-searching performances, an air-tight plot with masterful dialog, gritty realism, completely true-to-life action scenes, brilliant editing?  Although the answer is obvious (in case you haven't seen the trailer, the answer is NO), a much better question is, WHO CARES?!  This movie is all about fun!  Crazy, mind-blowing, awesome (and in some cases,of course, obviously impossible) extreme stunts!  Diesel is charismatic and charming, the girl is sexy and engaging and the bad guy is appropriately nuts.  The plot is good enough. The way they take out a communications tower doesn't make much sense, but otherwise we'd miss out on another amazing stunt scene so once again, who cares!  (Hey, check out 'Signs', a supposed new masterpiece by a supposed great director, if you want to see a film that really makes no sense!) There's some humor and a few decent one-liners, too.  One of the Bond spoofs is even smartly hilarious (a car stuffed Bond-style with gadgets that end up being virtually useless).  The way this film is NOT extreme is also refreshing.  There is just basic shoot-em-up and action stuff - no extreme violence/gore, no extreme profanity, no extreme sexual content, and no extremely 'important' artistic message.  In other words, nothing to detract from the great fun of a fast-paced, amazing stunt-fest that is light, refreshing, and visually awesome.  The perfect summer action flick!",figurative
"Very streaming style but a decent film A Merry Little Ex-Mas turns out to be a surprisingly fun and lively holiday comedy, offering far more entertainment than expected. From its opening moments, the film establishes a playful tone that carries through the entire runtime, delivering exactly the kind of light and festive energy viewers often hope for this time of year. While the premise is undeniably a bit wild, the movie embraces its own eccentricity, making it an enjoyable watch from start to finish.

Alicia Silverstone slips back into the familiar style that has defined much of her career, and while her acting remains one-dimensional, it works within the comedic framework of this story. Her presence feels nostalgic rather than restrictive, adding a layer of charm that helps ground the film's sillier moments. She may not surprise viewers, but she certainly delivers what her fans expect, and in a holiday comedy like this, that reliability is part of the appeal.

One of the true highlights of A Merry Little Ex-Mas is seeing Melissa Joan Hart and Alicia Silverstone share the screen. For anyone who grew up in the '90s, this pairing feels like a delightful reunion of two iconic figures from that era. Their chemistry-rooted as much in nostalgic recognition as in performance-adds a spark to the film and elevates scenes that might otherwise have landed flat. The rest of the cast contributes well, forming a dynamic ensemble whose energy enhances the humor throughout.

The comedy leans into slapstick, but never to a degree that becomes grating or excessive. Instead, the film finds a surprisingly steady rhythm, allowing the jokes to flow naturally without overwhelming the audience. Even when scenarios veer into the absurd, the pacing keeps everything balanced, maintaining a sense of control that many holiday comedies lack. The filmmakers clearly understood the tone they were aiming for and stuck to it with confident consistency.

While the storyline is undeniably messy and could have benefited from tighter writing, its flaws don't overshadow the film's overall appeal. This is a movie that knows it's meant for streaming and embraces that identity fully. The lower expectations associated with a streaming premiere actually enhance the viewing experience; instead of aiming for theatrical grandeur, the film settles comfortably into casual, cozy entertainment. It's the kind of movie you turn on knowing you're in for fun rather than depth, and it succeeds on those terms.

Ultimately, A Merry Little Ex-Mas proves to be an enjoyable, easy-watch holiday film powered by nostalgia, spirited performances, and an ensemble that genuinely seems to be having a good time. Its humor, its cast chemistry, and its festive personality make it worth a watch for anyone looking for a breezy seasonal escape. While it may not earn a spot among the all-time holiday greats, it certainly earns its place as a charming and entertaining addition to the genre-and a film well worth checking out on streaming.",literal
"It was hyped so much but it was horrible First of all why did the D Rex have no screen time like it was hyped up so much to show up for 10 minutes and the end didn't even show how they got home.

Also there was no battles like when the D Rex came I was expecting a T. Rex and a ton of dinosaurs to gang up on the D Rex but no.

And also how did the boyfriend survive like there was over 100 gallons of water blocking the door and somehow broke through and when he got hit by the sail and just popped up like nothing happened?

"James Badge Dale gives standout performance. If you like 90's Oozarks movies with realistic acting of the savage, cutthroat peoples of these places, then you will like this movie. Where families rule, and not the Law. Similar to Winter's Bone.

While Billy Magnussen gives a solid performance (much more serious than hes used to), its James Badge Dale that stands out. His Oscar worthy performance of charisma and intimidation will make you forget he was ""dressed to invade Poland"" in The Departed. He sure has come a long way since then. And while his performance will no doubt be overlooked, Im really glad I got to see it. Havent seen a performance like that from a newer movie in quite some time. I truely felt fear while his character was on the screen, and thats so rare for me while watching a movie.

The directing was great too Its shot really well, which is what made me want to watch it in the first place. It's a tad predictable, but I didn't mind. I loved the subtle foreshadowing throughout the movie as well.

While Violent Ends does feel like its missing that special something to make it truly stand out, its a very solid movie, and I highly recommend it if you like these types of movies. For General Audiences and todays ADHD kids.... not so much.

I'm very glad I watched it. Years ago, I wouldve rated this a solid 7.5/10, but in terms of todays awful movies, Ima bump it up to a 9/10.",figurative
"Guillermo del Toro Is a Highly Overrated Director Can I just say that I think Guillermo del Toro is a highly overrated director?

I guess I shouldn't be surprised that his version of ""Frankenstein"" takes a novel of ideas and turns it into a thuddingly literal and overlong movie preoccupied with monster movie histrionics and graphic violence.

If you want to be given the freedom of having a thought or emotional reaction of your own, good luck, because this ponderous movie telegraphs every single thing you're supposed to think and feel along the way. For example, are you wondering whether or not del Toro is making a parallel between Mia Goth's character and the butterfly she's captured? Fear not, because she gets a whole monologue that flat out tells you he is. Are we supposed to think that Victor Frankenstein has become more of a monster than the monster he's created? If Oscar Isaac's hammy performance and del Toro's exaggerated direction weren't already enough to answer that for you, we get a character who literally just says that. And whenever you might be worried that you'll have to draw some conclusions for yourself, here comes an interminable voice over narration to fill in the blanks for you.

""Frankenstein"" does come close to having some emotional resonance in its last moments, but only almost and it's far too little too late anyway. And it's got a cool visual design, but that's not enough to keep someone interested for two and a half hours. The second half of this film, where the point of view switches to Jacob Elordi's creature, is especially draggy. And I don't know how anyone signed off on the terrible CGI wolves and sheep.

No version of this story has come close to James Whale's original.

Grade: C-",literal
"Strong performance but one casting missed the mark Overall, the show was very well done. The acting was solid throughout, with the actor playing Alec Murdaugh delivering a particularly convincing performance, both in appearance and demeanor. Most of the cast were well-matched to their real-life counterparts, which made the story feel grounded and believable.

That said, the casting for Paul Murdaugh was a noticeable weak point. He didn't resemble the real Paul at all, which was distracting considering how closely the others fit their roles.

Still, this is a haunting and tragic story, and the show handles it with care. A compelling watch despite the casting issue.",literal

"Very warm and makes you feel happy I started watching because of Justin Hartley, I will watch anything with him, really. The series turned out to be very interesting and makes me feel good. The first season was a little too ""by the book"", even though the cases were interesting. But the second one picked it up even more and I am really enjoying the stories, they seem to be more complicated. I wouldn't call this a masterpiece but it does make you feel warm and fuzzy inside. I miss these sort of easy-going and nice stories with an interesting twist. The main story is also interesting. I also like how they are showing different places in US in different episodes. Give it a try, the first episodes give you a very good idea of what the series is about.",figurative
"overhyped? There is a lot to like about Sinners, MBJ'S twin role showed top level acting, Delroy Lindo giving solid veteran acting, beautifully shot....however the story suffers the most, the twin brothers Smoke&Stack are coming home to Mississippi from Chicago after 7 years in the mob scene, but we(the audience) don't see any of that, we just see the brothers back in Mississippi, which IMO left the characters kind of shallow, not understanding how ""badass"" they were in Chicago.

We see or hear nothing of any vampires at this point, only later when the natives come in the picture, it would've been great to have some buildup between the two groups to have them meet in the end.

Showing the horror of the vampires, and how vicious they are, or really they weren't needed, this could've been the black gangsters against the KKK.

With them protecting their frinds and family against the Klan, it just felt like something was missing...",figurative
What I think of the show Great show I love watching this with my mom every Tuesday night. I love how you never know what is going to happen in the episode so it always has you on the edge of your seat. I would recommend this to anyone who likes shows about firefighters or knows someone or even works as a firefighter themselves. Or someone just like me who is a regular person that just loves these kinds of shows.I love how they have people that are serious with their job and are willing to do anything to help someone in need. I recommend you start with season 1 and go on to their current season they always leave you hanging because you never know what will happen next to someone in the show.,literal
"Watch at home in the background This movie is just ok. It's nice to see the original cast, but I didn't care about the new generation. Why everything needs to have a new generation? I didn't like in the second movie when they started explaining the tricks as they went and in this one they've doubled with that. No magic whatsoever. I was hoping to see a return to the original, but I was disappointed 😞

IMO the worst movie from the trilogy. The first one is the only one that should exist. 5/10.",literal
"Great film for the era/time it was made!!! This movie is truly ahead of its time!! Considering when it was made, this film is very impressive. Thoroughly entertaining, good action and actually predicts a lot of the technology we currently have today. Definitely worth a watch!",literal
"For entertainment purposes only! I found this show completely entertaining - except for the choice of 'modern' music mixed in with the traditional Irish. But similar to watching ""The Crown"" you need to suspend belief and acknowledge no one was in the room with these characters, real or fictional. There is not one word that is not 'scripted' and other than people with these names existed, it's 99% made up.

It is unfortunate that despite the simple, clearly written disclaimer before each episode, people are not understanding that. IT'S FICTION! And I stress that particularly after doing quick internet searches to separate the fact from the fiction. To reference The Crown again, I remember one episode where a young Elizabeth and Phillip went off on their own and stayed on some little farm. I was truly surprised when I found out that NEVER happened. Not even remotely. I felt so...foolish. I accept the fact conversations have to be 'scripted' but to make up entire events that never happened?! I didn't expect that. Same for this show. Spoiler alert! None of the MAJOR story lines occurred in real life, but they do make for an interesting series!",literal
"Really Boring I decided to watch this after hearing how good it was - I hadn't watched any of it by the time the last episode had aired.

After watching the pilot I thought that the show had potential and was looking forward to getting into a new show - (having just finished Dexter and whilst The Walking Dead and Game of Thrones were both on a break).

The short first season spent its time building us up for nothing to actually happen. But as it was quite short and all I had heard was how amazing this show is I opened up Season 2. This was very much of the same - every episode building up to something but not much actually happening.

Admittedly Season 3 was a bit better but still quite boring in comparison to many people telling me it's the best TV show ever. In all honesty I haven't bothered with the last 2 seasons as I feel that I have lost several hours of my life watching the first 3 and it's not worth putting the effort in watching the rest. There are plenty of TV shows worth watching before this one. I cannot honestly see why this program has high reviews.",literal
"Love it It's a crowd pleaser and I really love it. It's also refreshing to see a 50 year old star looks very beautiful without an apparent filler. Please don't change. I am tired with unrealistic face of a star of a drama who looks like a full on movie star with lots of Botox and fillers.

Ok, the story's premise is interesting. The medical cases are as good as it gets since I have no background in medical. Yet I am a psychologist and I appreciate that the psychological aspects of a character is considered in this series. The cruelty of the antagonist character is endurable since everyone is still behaving like normal humans with personal problems it maneuver hence the 'colorful' characters and not just non stop cruelty tô people or the main character that it becomes masochism.

I highly recommend this series. And can't wait for the second season to air.",literal
"If a Nic Cage movie were a tv show You know the stereotypical Nic Cage movie with the cheesy writing, horrible lines, and even better delivery? That's Tulsa king.

The story advances as if it were simply just ticking boxes on a to do list. You don't feel anything for a single character and there's very little tension. Things just always work out the first time.

The best way I can describe Tulsa king is like this: you know when you watch a movie after smoking a joint and it's hard to take anything seriously because you're hyper aware of the fact that it's simply people saying lines and they aren't really their characters? That's Tulsa king.",literal
"Nice show with diverse cast I really enjoyed that this show portrays the lives of older people and all the difficulties that they have to face (death, family, relationships, dementia etc.).

I think this is also the first show/movie that i saw, that took place in a retirement home (albeit a very fancy and sort of ""unrealistic"" one with beauty salons, happy hours and hotel-like rooms).

I also liked that they generally featured a more diverse cast :) The storyline itself was well written and had me excited until the end - i was really curious to find out who the thief was. I think the chemistry between Charles and Julie was also great with a lot of funny moments. All in all it's really worth watching!",literal
"Wonderfully acted Jason Clarke absolutely transforms in this miniseries. Every episode has me forgetting it's him; he does such a fantastic job. Great casting across the entire family as well, especially when you compare to the actual people they are meant to portray. There's a lot to this story I wasn't familiar with, and overall I found each episode to be interesting and moved the story forward.",literal
"Trash version of good 007 movies This movie is a waste of time. This is a poor and stupid version of the so much better James Bond movies - all the old well known ideas are there - the guy that beats everyone and will solve anything, the guy that has all the fancy weapons, the lady who's also an agent and the all so previsible end - the agend and the girl on some paradise place while the ""boss"" is calling on some com device.",literal

Cinematography right out of YouTube creator level of work. Having this much budget and so many stories about Japan and you end up with this!? Cheap taste what it is.",literal
"Pretty damn good for an American remake the original British version is one of my favourite shows on TV and when i first heard that they were remaking it in the states, i like many others had serious doubts of it translating well, especially if you think of how glamorous American TV is and how unglamourous a show like shameless is. However i can safely say that John Wells and Showtime really have nailed it in adapting the show for the US audience. this can be said with how successful the show has been in America, which is great because it sort of mimics the same success the UK version had when it debuted in 2004. Despite there being some flaws, Showtime have overall done a terrific job in adapting shameless. 

while the story lines for the first season are pretty much americanised versions of the first series of the British version, there are several episodes that have there own story lines and the whole of season 2 completely deviates from the British story lines, in fact while watching season 2, the show felt more of a completely different show rather than a remake. the acting from everyone is very good, especially from Emmy Rossum, Joan cusack and William Macy. the story lines that the US writing team come up with are generally very inventive and have that same tongue and cheek humour that the British series has. the chemistry between Lip and Ian as well as Fiona and Steve is one of the strongest aspects of the show. the music is also great and fits into the show well. 

Now i am going to talk about the flaws of the show. even though i am from the UK and am not entirely familiar with American culture and how people live, there doesn't seem to be that much poverty to the show. the show just seems to be too glamorous and clean as opposed to the grittiness of the original UK version. another problem i have is William Macy as Frank. to me, David Threlfall IS Frank and while Macy isn't bad in the role, he just doesn't have that same quality that Threlfall delivers in the UK version. many fans of the UK version may also find the deviations in this version to be quite off-putting.

Overall, do i prefer this version to the original? the answer is No, i don't. while the acting, the story lines, the music and the overall feel to the show is great, this version just doesn't have the same spark as the original one has and i can also relate to the UK one more. if you are a fan of the UK version, you may find this remake hard to enjoy, however if you are able to ignore the fact that it is based on a British show and treat it as an entirely different show altogether, Shameless USA can be a very fun and entertaining show. if your American and haven't seen either version, then you probably will enjoy the US version more than the UK version.",literal
"Ignore the rave reviews First off, I've been watching Taylor Sheridan's stuff since Yellowstone. I liked how he played the Sheriff in Sons of Anarchy then he started making movies and TV shows. Hell or High Water was a good movie. I gave Yellowstone a chance. It was pretty good although season 5 started to ""jump the shark"", 1883 was fantastic, 1923 was boring and I just couldn't get into Mayor of Kingstown, but that's a whole different review.

I gave this series a shot because I'm a huge Sopranos fan (Terrence Winters wrote a few episodes) and it has Sly in it. I was ready to be entertained. Boy was this a let down. Allow me to explain:

This show advertises itself as ""Crime/Drama"". It doesn't take itself seriously to call it that. I don't know what to call it. Maybe dramedy? I don't know. What I do know is everything in this show is unrealistic. The characters are unlikeable. God bless Sly, but at 75, you can't convince me he's some tough, mob boss that just got out of prison. I can't pinpoint it, but he doesn't play this part well. This Tyson character who can't even explain himself why he's ditching his family to join up with Sly to be his driver for life. The ATF Agent who sleeps with him during a drunken night of sex, finds out he's 75 and is disgusted by that, leaves him and keeps coming back to him for some odd reason. This passive aggressive Bodhi guy who owns a marijuana business, gets shaken down randomly by Sly and simply goes with it. The jealous son of the Godfather mob boss character. The Nazi, Irish, Biker guy. List goes on. This show is a mess!

Don't even get me going on the dialogue. There's a bunch of cringey one liners I imagine thought up by either Taylor or Terrence thinking this is how New York Italians/mob talk like and this is what cops do.

I'm absolutely perplexed at the high rating. People giving it 8, 9, 10 is insane. The Godfather was a 10! Sopranos was a 10! I'd give Yellowstone a 7, 8 at best. 1883 was a solid 8. Tulsa King was just garbage. This series feels like Taylor and Terrence one day got together during a party, got drunk and talked about a scenario where this would happen and presented it to executives. Seeing how Taylor Sheridan is a hot name right now, they green lit it and said why not? Let's make some money.

I could almost guarantee this won't even get pass two seasons. Sly doesn't have it in him. He just looks tired. These characters on the show are not likeable. The story is bland. Dialogue/screenplay is rudimentary, I would even say bush league writing.

You been warned, but go ahead and give it a shot if you can make it past a few episodes. By the end, you'll realize what I said was true.",figurative
"From dusk tik dawn blues I just watched this movie and it reminds me of ""from dusk til dawn"" in many ways.both from a story perspective and that in both cases they take a good movie and then rape it in the 2nd half. Not sure if I also needed the black vs white tension that is spread across the story given the current political climate in the US, but then again I guess it is fitting for the era of the story. Overall the story is a 6/10 but on an overall level I enjoyed it much more.",literal
"Overrated I tried to like this TV show, but just couldn't. Firstly the characters are annoying and not likeable whether it's Lorelai or Rory. And then most of the episodes I watch keep stressing on how hot Lorelai is or what a babe she is. There is hardly any content which is gripping or makes you feel like you want to watch the next episode I have watched many shows and you tend to start liking the characters as the show moves on. They kind of grow on you, even if they have a negative shade in them. But here, nothing. It's just boring or probably not my kind of genre of television series. I still give it a 6, as I just find it average.",literal
"Not without its flaws... Like most, I watched all 11 seasons. 1-5 were awesome, then things started going downhill. Don't believe the reviewers who gave it 1 star.....if it's a 1, why'd they hang in for 11 seasons? That said, the final season was entertaining, but had its disappointments: Hyper-politicized dialogue, the cheap laugh of the guy getting ran over by a truck, Kev & V's kids somehow ingest edibles and beer without getting sick, no mention of Fionna in Frank's letter, Mickey and Ian steal an Ambulance scott-free and if Lip is renting, why does he have to come up with $3-4k to fix the gas pipes? That's the landlord's problem. Ok, I'm done. Ya, I'm nit picking, but it just seams like the writing got sloppy in the end. Zero issues with the acting....well done. I never skipped through ""The luck you got"". Arguably one of the best TV theme songs ever.",figurative
"I still don't get it. I saw the first season with my ex a long time back. I remember the first season being pretty entertaining but after that it fell off the deep end with most episodes being procedural comedy with no real direction. As the seasons went by, the show fell into predictable groove of nonsensical horror and comedy and has been that way ever since.

However, this show is now on its 15th season, so its popular enough to keep running. Out of curiosity I decided to check out season 13 to see if the writing has matured... unfortunately its the same generic thin strand of good vs evil with none of it being very compelling. The show often tends to recycle the main plot with slightly varying degrees of characters wanting to destroy the world, agnels and demons have no real distinction in motivation and are generally just cannon fodder for some action. Even worse, the powers of a demon or angel are constantly in flux each episode. Sometimes they are powerful enough to take out everybody by themselves other times they have problems holding off a single hunter in hand to hand combat. There used to be times where Demons would somewhat act their part and possess people and make them do things but lately they are just a customary mindless distraction in the middle of every episode.

While the main casts of the series do an alright job of the acting, what really saves the show is Jensen's Ackles (Dean Winchester's) natural gruff but likeable personality. He often tends to be the badass as well as the comic relief in most cases and generally dominates most scenes he is presented in and its pretty obvious from most of the discussions that take place in the boards, most fans are mainly just worried about creating their own relationships with characters. If you are looking for a horror with some potency, this isn't it. It had something at the very start but devolves into a generic tv show with elements of supernatural action that gets rather stale.",literal
"Nobody want this. Exactly. One of the most boring things I've ever seen.

I gave it three episodes to see if it could get any better, but no, I just wasted my time on one of the most boring, cringe and useless things I've ever seen.

Characters are flat, story is just boring and unoriginal and for a series that's supposed to be a comedy I haven't even had a mild smile once.

Netflix once again shows that it's not about the money, it's about quality and ideas, and both are nowhere to be seen here.

I'm wondering if all these reviews that are praising this thing are just fake at this point.

Do yourself a favour and just skip this.",literal
"A Poignant and Hilarious Journey Through Tokyo As someone less familiar with Japanese filmography beyond a watch of the recent hit, Shogun, this was refreshingly different, but not in an unapproachable way; the friendly face of Brendan Fraser provides an instant point of recognition for westerners such as myself. Throughout this two-hour journey, the audience are given insight into the many joys and throws of modern Japanese culture, whether it comes from cleverly written emotional dialogue or visual cues such as the Monster Cat Festival - yet the film is far from an oversimplification of modern Japan - as Takehiro Hira says in an opening sequence, you could live in Tokyo for 100s of years and still not uncover all of its secrets. Director Hikari builds upon this cultural foundation with a poignant and hilarious emotional odyssey, featuring gut-wrenching moments of pain juxtaposed by much needed comedic relief. Neither sides are done cheaply - although the plot is generally predictable, it does not need to be complex; the writing is intelligent enough by itself. I thoroughly look forward to the film's general release, when I will be attending again for a second viewing!",figurative
"Whats with the low ratings I honestly thought this was a good movie that played into the first movie better than I thought it could. What was once superstitions led into a Freddy Krueger nightmare of events. It made sense though with the first movie. I really liked it surprisingly. My only real beef with it is the going into final dream to all of a sudden him being able to come out and kill people. It was just weird.

Watched at AMC with Heather on 10-19-2025.",literal
"S2 suck so far While season 1 was really dark, funy and good, seasn 2 is none of that so far. The show first season focused mainly on Wednesday where as s2 make a lot of time for the family with not interesting storyline. Its going in multiple direction with the lack of focus of the first season. Hope we go back to a more linear, coherent and more focused storytelling for the next season.",literal
"Joke This film is renowned amongst my group of movie going friends as the worst movie we have ever seen. It is regularly joked about, the mere mention of the title prevokes guffaws of laughter.

It has become the standard against which all other incredibly bad movies are scored.

The friend that selected this one has had, from the night we saw the movie, the reputation of being the worst selector of movies.

Try as we may, we have yet to find a movie as bad as this one.

Don't do it to yourself, unless you want to see a true 1 out of 10.",literal
"I'm very impressed Predator: Badlands was amazing! The CGI and landscapes were absolutely stunning - seriously, some of the shots were so cinematic I was just blown away. The action was intense and really well done, keeping me hooked the entire time.

That said, I've got to mention the robot girl... her acting and some of the stuff she did were just too cringy for me, haha. She honestly took me out of the movie a few times. I also wasn't the biggest fan of the boss character, but thankfully the rest of the film made up for it.

The ending was great - that revenge moment hit perfectly, and the cliffhanger got me genuinely hyped for the next movie. I'll definitely be there to see it when it comes out!",figurative
"This movies is so nice,I love the actors in this film This is an easy-to-watch crime series with predictable plots, likable characters, some fun cameos, and nice scenery. Viewers who grew up watching Murder She Wrote or any number of prime-time crime shows will likely enjoy Murder in a Small Town. Talk to Your Kids About ... Families can talk about the storyline of each show and whether they can tell, at the onset, who committed each crime, and what the clues were that they observed to reach their.

On a social-emotional level, the two main characters, police chief Karl and librarian Cassandra, are two kind but complex characters. Do your children identify more with the strong and silent type of personality as portrayed by Karl? Or do they see more of themselves in the emotional but wounded Cassandra?",literal
"Perfection. Fantastic in every way. Keri Russell is at her best (and thank you for making her look like a real human being.) The relationships are complex and interesting, the events plausible, and the music a little nugget of joy that adds to this series.

If you enjoy the political dramas with an element of espionage this is your cake. If you enjoy the Bridgerton/Downton Abbey cultural components of decorum and architecture then that's your frosting.

Beyond that I wish to add nothing else because I hate spoilers and giving away too much. The only downside is that its only 8 episodes. Cannot wait for season 2.",literal
"A Lovely Introduction As someone who doesn't have much prior experience with DC movies, this movie has compelled me to get into the DC-verse. I absolutely loved the tone of the film -- it's positive and upbeat feeling alongside it's serious political themes and messaging really appealed to me. I like the idea of a humble Superhero who can get hurt, but what makes them super is that they get back up and they never give in. However, I understand that I am a new fan, and so it makes sense that I have no complaints in any potential differences between this portrayal of Superman when compared to other portrayals of him. But I have also noticed that many people were relieved by this Superman and his cheerful, sweet, nature. So I'd like to look at this in the only way I, a new fan, can -- separating it from other Superman films. In that light, the hope and joy this movie gives me cannot be tainted by things like pacing or worldbuilding. I am happy with this film. I love it.",literal
"Not British Worst British accent by an American actor. Kills the show. You can hear the actor is trying, but he comes in and out of the accent which is very distracting. Pity, I had high expectations. I consider Morris Chestnut to be a very good actor but not all actors can play certain characters and in this case, it's not a good fit. I did watch the entire episode and I have to give credits to the writers, Job well done. I am sure however, sure that fans of Sherlock Homes will give this one a try. Fans of Morris Chestnut will definitely tune in...but in the long run, Holmes has always been played by a Brit and the accent does matter.",literal
"Perfect I have to hand it to you Americans - when it comes to decent TV shows, you have us Brits beaten, hands down; Sopranos, Six Feet Under and this, Law & Order.

It's an excellent show which makes for firmly compulsive viewing, with great scripts and solid acting. The icing on the cake for me is the stunningly beautiful Angie Harmon as an Assistant D.A.

It's a top show - if you haven't seen it already, then make sure you see it next time it's on - well worth a look.",literal
"Finally - A New Medical Drama That's Good It's been a very long time since I watched a medical series. OK, so I watched House but for me it was never about the medical stuff. It was always about Gregory House. WWHD? One of the best characters ever written for television.

Anyway, prior to House, I think it was E. R. but that was literally a soap opera. 'Nuff said.

The Pitt is different.

The cast is great.

The acting is top notch.

The writing is excellent.

The characters are engaging and relatable.

It's very easy to get sucked into the show.

Some of the medical stuff is maybe a bit much but it's not loads of miraculous crap that you see on other shows. For the most part, The Pitt is realistic.

The final Season 1 episode airs tomorrow. I can't wait to see it but I also don't want to watch it because then the wait is on for Season 2 in January 2026.

It's really a very good show. Check it out and see.",literal
"Great movie The Movie feels like pure entertainment from start to finish. It keeps the energy high, the pacing tight, and the personality of the original show completely intact. The cast chemistry is the standout. You get the same playful competitiveness, the same smart humor, and the same chaotic charm that made the series a hit.

The movie balances comedy with action in a way that pulls you in without ever dragging. The missions are clever. The twists land. The jokes hit. You stay hooked because the film knows exactly what its fans love and delivers it with bigger scale and sharper production.

Whether someone is a long-time fan or brand new, the movie works. It's fun, fast, and full of character. It feels like you're sitting in a cinema smiling the whole time.

If you're after something easy to enjoy with personality and momentum, this one's worth it.",literal
"The Special Effects Are the Movie The plot reminded me of Aliens with unscrupulous business people going for the big buck, regardless of who gets crushed in the wake. As others have pointed out, I, too, didn't have much of an emotional connection with the characters. They seemed to be props for the main attraction---the dinosaurs.

The dinosaurs are amazing. I have no idea how they accomplished the special effects at all. They alone are worth the price of admission. No expense was spared in that department. David Koepp wrote the script and considering what a busy year he's had, I guess I'll let him slide on the this one and just focus on the dinosaurs.",literal
"Not worth the title 'The Running Man' I am a big fan of Stephen King. I loved The Running Man. So obviously I was very excited that someone had made a film of it. And when a local network showed the film, I was in heaven. I was all ready for a night of fun!

The first indicator that something was wrong was when I noticed that someone had cast Arnold Schwarzenegger. I could simply not believe that a man who got famous for films filled with runnin' an' shootin' could play a more cunning part, as was described in the book. I still was convinced that this would be a good film, however. Who knows, maybe Arnold had some hidden talents?

Well, he didn't. I soon found out that the only reason he was even cast was because someone had re-written the entire story to MAKE it about fightin' an' shootin'. Yup, it was a standard Arnold-film: hero is done wrong, hero solves problems by flexing his mighty muscles and scaring everyone away and hero gets the girl.

I was stunned. This is NOT what the book said at all. I know that books can't be put on screen literally, but this didn't even have ties to the book. Stephen King should have openly denounced any affiliation with the film and he should have forbidden using the title The Running Man for this shameless waste of film. I don't say it often, but this film was BAD. If I weren't at home watching, I'd have tossed rotten tomatoes at the screen. Once again: bad.

(Note that I used 'someone' a lot. I did this because I'm sure a lot of people are ashamed to have worked on this and I don't want to embarrass them even further by naming them here)",literal
"A Great Edition to TV Entertainment....Chicago Fire When this show first aired, I was not interested on watching a fire fighting drama. Besides, I've been watching another Wolf Production since 1999 and that was good enough for me. However, when Chicago PD was introduced, I decided to watch it because it came on directly after my favorite show and I love TV drama series. I feel in love with Chicago PD because of the zest and criminal kick-ass and I was hooked.

When Chicago Fire crossed over with Chicago PD recently, I was forced to watch Chicago Fire. Hummm, Chicago Fire very interesting and exciting I thought. I went to HBO On Demand and watched Season 2 of Chicago Fire. Let me tell you, I didn't cook, I didn't answer my phone, I ordered food delivery service and didn't move off of my sofa(only for bbreak) until I watched every episode. I then went to a local retail store and bought Season 1 and the disconnect from the world started all over again. By now you know where my review is going.

Watching Chicago Fire help me to understand Detective Voight, Dawson etc.. and how Chicago PD was piloted. I was upset with me for not watching Chicago Fire initially. Readers, to understand Chicago PD, you have to watch Chicago Fire. I love the intertwining of the shows. It is so damn interesting.

Chicago Fire is a potpourri of diversity, family, loyalty, emotions and laughter. A show that promotes life/death,the response and the danger firefighters face everyday, gives me a deeper respect for my local firefighter and EMT services.

I commend Mr. Wolf for having such great writers and actors/actress, I am humbled. I am aware it's only entertainment. However it's entertainment in a true and realistic form.

One of the Best Shows on TV.",literal
"Big, bold original cinema at its finest Sinners is an extremely rare original, R rated, big budget film from an auteur operating with what feels like complete creative control as different genres collide in a crowd pleasing horror film that absolutely delivers all the goods. It puts a fresh spin on the classic tropes of Vampirism which also directly links to what it's saying about artistic expression and colonialism whilst lovingly homaging the work of John Carpenter and being a love letter to the transportive power of the blues.

Michael B. Jordan nails the duality of playing twins by convincingly portraying Smoke and Stack as two entirely different personalities who care about each other. Smoke is commanding and wise whereas Stack is more prone to making mistakes and is generally a lighter presence. Miles Caton is phenomenal thanks to his steely determination and youthful charm combined with a fantastic singing voice. All of that is made even more impressive considering it's his screen debut.

The supporting cast is full of actors at the top of their game. Wunmi Mosaku and Hailee Steinfeld both have a uniquely palpable chemistry with Michael B. Jordan and it's especially satisfying to see how quickly Wunmi Mosaku understands the gravity of the situation. Delroy Lindo is having a ball getting some of the biggest laughs whilst still feeling like a three dimensional character and Jack O'Connell truly relishes the complex yet gleeful villainy of Remmick.

Ryan Coogler's direction takes some seriously bold swings and is confidently methodical, properly taking its time to immerse you in this story so you care about the characters once the much bloodier horror moments begin to creep in gradually before eventually letting all hell break loose in a show-stopping finale. It also contains the most substantial end credits scene of all time that is basically the actual ending but it genuinely works better in this separated structure.

Autumn Durald Arkapaw's cinematography is consistently stunning and only gets better when it's in the glorious IMAX aspect ratio which is employed for a standout one take during the best musical sequence that transcends space and time. Ludwig Göransson's score is a character in itself and one of his best in a career almost exclusively full of genre defining work. It constantly oozes style with a broad range of styles contained in the one soundtrack.",literal
"meh... Ok. Disclaimer. Huge King fan. Seriously, i normally do not watch the books adapted to movies. I usually hate them. But my son really wanted to watch so... Here's a review. It's not bad. It's not great. It does follow the book in some aspects and ignores in others. If you haven't read the book, watch it. If you're a King fan, well, don't expect much. And, being brutal, Tim Curry as the original Pennywise is freaking fantastic. The other actor cannot compare or compete.",literal
"Mind you this is a weak 8 !! My girlfriend and I were discussing this and we've come to this conclusion. Overall, there were a couple episodes that were top-tier, would rate them in the high 9s. They were thought-provoking (mainly season 1), great cinematography, great acting, great score (esp season 3). But the other episodes would fall around a six or seven which is pretty solid. However the hour long run-time on those meh episodes just made it feel like it was dragging on for the majority of the episode just to reveal some big cliffhanger at the end (this is my gf's opinion not mine, i thought it built suspense nicely). So rounds out at a weak eight overall. Season one was the best, then three, then two.",literal
"The shadows of human connections Task is the kind of show that crawls under your skin. What struck me most is how the show portrays connections between people - not just love or loyalty, but also the ways dependence, manipulation, and fear can twist those bonds. It makes you question what we accept from others, and what we become willing to give up just to feel needed.

It's not an easy watch. At times, it feels almost too much, but that intensity is exactly what makes it so powerful. It's rare for a show to feel this raw and uncompromising.

""Task"" is dark, complex, and haunting. If you're looking for something light, this isn't it. But if you want a series that challenges you and lingers long after the credits roll, this is the one.",literal
"Absolute Brilliance From the Start I've been watching since the Pilot, which had incredible pacing & more content than expected. I knew that every episode had to be like the Pilot if it had chance of being a good show, and I must admit it exceeds my expectations every episode. I'll even go as far as putting it in league with Game of Thrones, just because that was the last show that kept be excited throughout episodes until I started the Rookie. I've watched Nathan Fillion since his Firefly days, and I knew he'd be the automatic highlight of the show. Much like Firefly & Castle, Nathan is the heart soul and being of the show and carries it on his shoulders. And as the show keeps going, we see different sides to all the other characters and have been able to see the immense talent the other actors possess. This is a great group of actors that carry the mood. And the best part of this show is the writing. The pacing never slows down, there's nonstop action but also breaths of brilliance for emotional scenes, no issue or story arc lingers too long and resolutions are constantly met as new challenges for characters arise, and there's a great balance between drama, humor, and emotion. This is easily the best show on television right now and I hope they have at least a few seasons under their belt before the inevitable dry seasons that most shows endure once their greatest stories are told. I'm a fan. Can't wait for the future.",literal
"Underrated show on Prime If you like a show with an unreliable lead then you can do worse then this. The basic premise is a simple one. FBI Agent Emily Byrne (Played by the incredible Stana Katic - and the show is worth it just for her alone) disapeared and was declared dead seven years ago; the last victim of a serial killer she was chasing. Even though her body was never found she was declared dead ""in absentia"" (get it) in order to put the serial killer in jail for her murder since the FBI could not directly connect him to any of his other crimes. But when she reappears and bodies keep dropping and get connected to her not him it sends her, her ex-husband (also an FBI agent) and the FBI on a trail into Emily's past.

Season 2 also deals heavily with Emily's past and her connection to a series of odd murders. Emily back in the FBI with her own agenda investigates a series of murders by Fentanyl injection which leads her all the way around the world and back again.

I am on season 3 right now but again since the show is what it is it is bound to circle to Emily and her family and an emotional trauma both Emily's, her ex husband's and her sons. But that is what makes the show special. It is to bad the show has so few viewers because it is a great show and it is worth the watch.",figurative
"American TV at its most mediocre Yet another CBS show that takes itself far too seriously.

The main character is flat and what we used to call 'serious delirious'. The dude needs to lighten up some. The supporting characters have potential, but don't get enough screen time to properly develop beyond the superficial. The only exception is the lawyer. Fiona Rene seems to be having fun with her character, and the character does have fun. I do wonder how she manages to make a living when she is galavanting around the country helping Shaw rather than practicing law.

Another huge problem is information gathering. All the people who provide support seem to be savants. They research or hack all the information needed to crack the case wide open in record time. Bob seems able to access real time phone records and track it faster than a normal person could just type a name. There's a lot of belief to be suspended here.

Then there's the amazing discovery of the missing person that law enforcement, with all their resources, wasn't able to manage. Everything wrapped up in a tidy bow in under an hour.

Shows like this are why I prefer to stream Nordic noir.",literal
"Just As Good As The Book I had read this book when it was originally published (in 1979 under Stephen King's nom de plume Richard Bachman) and I reread just last year so I knew what to expect going into this film. The story is dark and dystopian and not for the faint of heart. Plus the violence in the film is extremely graphic. But I found the acting to be superb, especially the two young lead actors Cooper Hoffman (as Raymond Garraty) and David Jonsson (Peter McVriess). Like a lot of films adapted from books there are a few changes so if you know the plot from the book you'll still have some surprises.

I gave this 7 out of 10 stars. Extremely intense and, like I said, really solid acting.",literal
"Wildly overrated I watched four seasons of this show and then lost interest completely.

It's not a terrible show but it is a wildly overrated show.

Before I started watching it people said the first season was just OK but it got much better after that. I think the opposite is true.

The first season was all about the meth side of things. That made it interesting. It quickly developed into a kind of dark, dramatic farce that I found most enjoyable.

Also, the characters were great. I really enjoyed the development of Walter and Jessie's relationship. It was strained but funny because of it.

From my point of view the show jumped the shark between the end of the first season and the start of the second. Only a small shark; maybe a barracuda; and it spent the rest of its run straining against the urge to execute a further, much bigger leap, like a superman punch over a great white.

1. It quickly regressed to the mean and became a soap opera. Soap operas are popular. That must be why it got MORE popular. The humour took a back seat and the melodrama grabbed the wheel.

2. The characters became unknowable. They felt and acted in whatever way was necessary to progress the story regardless of who they had been before. They made more and more out of character choices until they lost all definition. It began to appear that everyone in the show had some sort of borderline personality disorder.

3. It became increasingly reliant on hang time. This is when a very predictable chain of events is set in motion but takes an excruciatingly long time to resolve, by which time any resolution feels unsatisfactory. It's like you feel like you need to sneeze for weeks and then the feeling just fades away.

4. The lack of coherent character development seemed to lead to an inability to progress the story. The characters seem to start down one path; then backtrack; then try another; and they just never go anywhere. They keep having the same arguments and making the same mistakes and doing random inexplicable things.

5. Jessie. In the beginning it looks like Jessie is a smart kid that has gone off the rails. Bit of cliché but it still had merit as an opportunity to see what kind of person he might grow into as a result of the journey he and Walter had embarked on. What actually happens is that he turns into an idiot. People are affected by their relationships and their actions; that's how people develop/grow/change. Jessie did not grow. He devolved into a half wit. He had to because the Jessie from the first series, while not a Mensa member, was not stupid enough to end up where he did later on.

6. Coincidence driven. This is one of the main reasons why I can't understand all the talk of great writing on this show. Using coincidence to progress a story is a sign of very poor writing.

7. The end of season four felt like the end of the show to me. Walter had emerged victorious but in doing so he had become just like his mortal enemy. I thought that was quite a cool ending. Then another season happened but I just couldn't get interested.

Having said all that, I did watch four seasons and I did enjoy it a lot in patches. It retains some of the season one humour throughout, the acting is great, and there are a few great characters skirting around the central group of narcissistic personality disorder sufferers. Mike, Hank, and Sol are my favourites.

I think I'm just a little disappointed in the show. There were so many interesting directions to go in after the first season and really it didn't go anywhere. I think of I knew how to make meth and I decided to go into business today I'd expect to be a long way from where I started in five years time; a long, long way.",figurative
"They should rename it Beth I loved the first four seasons, but the new season is so Beth-centric, it's lost its spark. While Beth in small doses made for a great sub plot, her brooding, anger, hate and self destructive attitude as the central character has become so annoying and tedious, I found myself cheering for Jamie to punch the accelerator and run right through her.

Every time a new sub plot pops up, there's Beth to skull a vodka and storm out of the room, or sit at the table and whinge. There's still time to salvage things, but more Casey, Rip, John and the Cowboys, and less Beth, would go a long way to getting back on track.",literal
"Epic fail! As someone who was a child when the original came out, I know how great of a movie this was. I have no clue what this garbage is that I was watching. After the first 30 minutes, I'd had more than enough torture and turned it off. Beverly acting like a prostitute in training, cutting her hair off, the kids making sexual jokes and using profanity, a totally weird looking Penny Wise, and various other ridiculous occurrences I'm sure I very fortunately missed....this movie is an insult to Stephen King, as well as time wasted on this film that we can never get back.",literal
"Reminds me of Uncut Gems. Every bad decision leads to another problem and another bad decision, ratcheting up the pressure on both Jude Law and Jason Bateman. The pressure gave me anxiety - in a good way.

I don't want to give too much away but the twists and turns have you yelling "" no!!!"" To the main characters as they wander intro another problem.",literal
"It turns the world of Leaphorn, Chee, and Manuellito upside down. I have really respected Zahn McClarnan's work in the past and looked forward to this version. Acting was good but the script and concept is so far from Tony Hillerman's (and later Anne Hillerman's) vision that I elected not to pursue future episodes.

I admit that I am old and well steeped in the Leaphorn and Chee tradition from the excellent novels and the Robert Redford PBS American Masterpiece programs so this version- which discards the most basic elements in favor of superficial oh so predictable plot progression and politically correct characters that this is thin gruel indeed.

Joe Leaphorn is NOT Joe Leaphorn. Bernie is NOT Bernie. And Jim Chee is from another universe altogether. It could be that everything was changed to make the series more palatable to a younger audience which has not experienced the richness of the novels from Tony Hillerman and continued by his daughter Anne, but there is no there, there and Jim Chee is NOT Jim Chee- not even close.

Maybe as a stand alone with new names for the characters it might work, but it plods and skims along the surface of something that has great potential to tell a great story.

I hope that those new to the Lephorn Chee Manuelito canon might take the time to read or listen to the books as written by the Hillermans, both father and daughter there is much to be drawn from them and, in my opinion, provide a much greater return for the time invested.",figurative
The Artist over the Manufacturer Smiling Friends is a testament to the creative landscape of what personal content creation can lead to and how it focuses on artist to consumer interactions that allow the creators of animation or anything of the sort to be more grounded and appreciative of the craft and their impact on it. The animation is not too large a departure from other familiar styles. The characters and personalities are by far the most driving factors of the show itself. The dry and absurdist humor as well as the range of which the show can strike your funny-bone is incredibly enjoyable. Coming from the platforms of Newgrounds and Youtube has allowed for some truly interesting and hilarious comedy from the likes of Zach Hadel and his constituents. I have no doubt in my mind that there is more to come from the minds behind Smiling Friends and I am left eagerly awaiting.,literal
"Terrible movie with even worse acting. Except from a few impressive effects, nothing about this movie is good. The plot is oh so weak and even that weak plot is poorly executed. The script could very well be the dumbest, most cliché filled and all over worst script written. Unlike som flicks such as for example Tango & Cash the script isn't bad in a funny kind of way. It's just bad. Vin Diesel's performance is one the worst I've ever seen in a movie this big. Asia Argento puts in a decent performance and Samuel L Jackson does what you would expect him to do in a crappy movie like this, plays on routine. He has played that part so many times he could do it in his sleep. You can tell that none of the actors in this movie belived in it, and why should they? They did their job (poorly) cashed their checks, went home and never thought of this movie again. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. If you want to see a cool action flick, just re-watch Die Hard.",literal
"Absolutely boring movie I wasted my Saturday evening and money watching this film, and honestly, I wonder how such scripts are turned into movies. I then can't understand how it's receiving 10-star reviews from others. Don't waste your money going to the cinema. Being a Disney movie it might get released on the Disney app or some other app.",literal
"do your research before watching this show If you actually know the full, true story of Jeffrey Dahmer, much of this show is infuriating. It is riddled with inaccuracies and over dramatization. However, it's wise to keep in mind that this isn't a documentary on Dahmer, it's a TV show, so excess and ridiculous drama is expected. The show overall is pretty good, but surprisingly SO slow. Each episode lasted an eternity and was wayyyy too drawn out. I understand this is how shows make their money, but it's rough as a viewer. I was also expecting much more gore and violence. There's next to none. Almost all graphic content is described by other people in the episodes, not actually seen. I really dislike how the show is pieced together as well. The first episode starts with Dahmer being arrested, and we backtrack from there, spring forward, backtrack, spring forward, etc. It seems like a really strange way to tell a story like this. It makes it more confusing than it already is. The timeline they actually lay out for Dahmer's life is wack. Finally, the involvement of basically everyone involved is super exaggerated, but this is how they make the story more compelling I guess. They also make this story 1000x more racially charged than it actually was. However, I was definitely expecting that. My biggest piece of advice before watching Dahmer is to do your research. There's a short documentary on Peacock called ""Dahmer on Dahmer"" that I highly recommend watching FIRST. Even simply reading Jeffrey Dahmer's Wikipedia was incredibly informative and it gives you a knowledge base for this show. The show itself is decently entertaining, but all viewers should keep in mind that this portrayal is not at all accurate. The ratio of accuracies to inaccuracies are 1:10, seriously. It's almost like the writers took the story of Dahmer as a template and made up 5 other storylines and mashed them all together to make a show that is kinda about Dahmer, but really not. It's so weird and annoying.

I'm giving this show a six because the acting is top tier, especially by Evan Peters. He absolutely nailed the character of Jeffrey Dahmer. Unbelievable acting all around.",figurative
"What's wrong with Hollywood? When people say that Hollywood is going down the drain, then this movie and its 10 Oscar nominations proves why. Where are the days of good storytelling? Why does a musical have zero good song, why does a one-night show have to be dragged into two movies of supposedly 5 hours when even after one hour nothing happens? Oh, here is the answer: It's all about money. It's not about quality or any sort of artistic value. It's simply about making money. And I cannot understand why people still attend such stupid shows on Broadway. The biggest joke of American pop culture right now is the actual political situation. Does it really need second rate music, too? And a singer that's over-hyped as an actress?",literal
"Disappointing The psychological terror of the book was largely lost, and cutting scenes like the hordes of fans taking side-bets or collecting mementos missed an opportunity to comment on the voyeurism seen with reality tv. The changes to the end weakened the story considerably. The book has stayed with me for about 30 years. The film, not so much.",literal
"Expected More from You, Jonas Brothers Come on, Jonas Brothers... I really expected more from this movie.

The directing was truly the only strong point.

I kept hoping for a fresh and exciting story, but it felt a bit too familiar , almost like watching older movies repeated in a new wrapper.

This film had so much potential, and it could have been amazing, especially for us '90s kids who grew up with you and hold so many nostalgic memories.

The teenager inside me was honestly a little disappointed... I was hoping for something more special.",literal
"The biggest disappointments of 2025 I am a fan of the original movie with Schwarzenegger, but I also think that it's the perfect movie to remake since the premise is cool, but the movie was quite cheap looking and oozed b-movie.

That's why I was really hyped for this one, especially since I've always enjoyed Edgar Wright with his witty humor, world class editing and high-tempo action.

But man, we got the exact opposite.

I was expecting a tempo non-stop action, but what we actually got was a 2hr long movie with maybe 15 mins of actual action? The rest of the movie is below average dialoge with zero tempo what so ever. I actually considered to walk out from the theatre for the first time ever

Avoid at all costs.",literal
"Deeply affective tale about family and healing Watched at the 2025 Toronto International Film Festival.

Ouch. This movie really hit me close to home.

Joachim Trier once again has crafted a masterful character study tale about family, healing, and the dramatic elements between the dynamics of conflict and characters. Trier's direction on the writing, the setting, the characters and the atmosphere feels genuinely raw realistic and portraited with every dose of naturalist, faithfulness, and emotional weight. He understands how people are act, their personalities and how human connections work, which allows the movie to bring out the light and realistic nature successfully.

With the great color presentation, camerawork, atmosphere and direction, the narrative is really strong. The writing offers great character moments, emotional connections, and well-crafted dialogue between the characters. There are some dialogue pieces that, as of writing this, are still grained and burned into my memory. Alongside with the wonderful performances from the cast members.

I really love the usages of how sound plays in, the themes that are explored, and the established setting and environment that Trier captures. Each felt purposeful without being over the top, and the emotional barrier weight remains reflective and powerful.

Having gotten lots of buzz from Cannes, I can safetly say this is one of the best movies of 2025.",literal
"Why the Negativity? Why does everyone think they're a legit film & TV critic? For what this show is, it's wonderful! While they're are airways going to be the WTF moments in a show, it's a show. It's to entertain us with fake scenarios. I do wish it was more outdoorsy, since the opening scene showed different elevations from a map. As a geographer, that's what drew me in initially, but I'll stick with it though. I thoroughly enjoy seeing this side of Justin Hartley. I also love the lesbian couple, though I don't think they've even explained who they are. I think, in time, they'll flesh out all the characters for us.",literal
"Excellent Hawke vehicle Ethan Hawke plays a rare book seller and writer who leads this modern western noir, navigating his way through brutes, femme fatales, and confederates (sometimes literally) to write a follow up to a surprisingly successful story he wrote for a long form magazine about a prominent family. Danger and mystery meet him at every turn.",literal
"Phenomenal I don't know much about the musical, but I'm familiar with the classic Judy Garland version, The Wizard of Oz. The world-building in this film is the best since Harry Potter and delivers everything you'd want from a fantasy experience. It looks, sounds, and feels exactly as a great fantasy movie should. Ariana Grande brings her own unique personality to Glinda, blending charm with a playful, modern energy that feels fresh and exciting. Cynthia Erivo delivers a powerful and heartfelt performance as Elphaba, infusing the character with raw emotion and a profound sense of strength. Their on-screen chemistry makes every scene between them unforgettable, elevating the story's magic and emotional depth. Can't wait for part two!",literal
"Series was great until Stella Kidd/Miranda Mayo took over We loved the show until all the stars started leaving, wondering if that's why they're going? So much drama when Stella showed up, over what? Such a drama queen, all the time.! Way way way too much drama all the time with Stella, we'd love to see more of the other actors, but there's way too much Stella! Large & in charge now. We change channels if we don't see enough of the other actors, that's so sad. We still have our Chicago PD to watch :)",literal
"Wonderful show! Finally a high-quality Netflix show! If you loved Kerri Russell in The Americans, you'll love this one. I personally love any government / spy thrillers and this has that, plus great relationship storylines. I think the show does a good job showing just how much professional demands dominate the lives of government agents, forcing them to have complicated personal relationships. Overall great acting as well, with bits of fun and humor that brings lightheartedness to an otherwise serious theme. The show has a refreshing twist on an otherwise repetitive theme, and I felt like it was very well balanced. Can't wait for season two!!!",literal
"Words cannot describe how much I love this show. If you are considering watching this show, do yourself a favor and watch it. It is superb. The acting is so good. TMS reminded me why I love Reese and Jennifer so much. Perfect casting. Aniston and Witherspoon blew me away. Apple is going to provide quality original content. I am so proud of the leading ladies. Unbelievable performance.",literal
"I am not watching past first episode I can see how people can like this show, but I just can kinda see where it is going.

Also, a really dumb plot thing, and I am not giving away too much, since this happens pretty early on, but it is completely unbelievable that having just had several stash house robberies, the gang leaves just a skeletal crew of two people defending. These jokers should have gotten ambushed like 4 robberies ago.",literal
"After the Last 2, I was anticipating... Now you see me, Now you don't, and you'll wish you hadn't.

Too many Horsemen, too much virtue signaling, too many generational archetypes.

Just 10 people with different opinions and of different generations arguing about nothing and achieving about as much.",literal
"Unexpectedly good entertainment What I most admired about this film was the restraint. Small town America, a story told perfectly. No hyperbole, very little moralising and a great deal of fun, particularly showcasing the hero's gymnastic abilities. But he was a low key hero, just working to solve everyday problems, how to find food, where to sleep. Two believable children, Kirsten Dunst putting in a good performance. Somebody worked hard on this script, the pastor and his wife providing an excellent comedy routine, Ben Mendelssohn in particular was excellent. Even the accomplice spoke perfectly believable commonsense, saying to the hero (I am paraphrasing) your practical skills are good but you are weak on the emotional level.",literal
"Gold plated rubbish... Flamboyant, charismatic, and impressive that's Dwight sent to sort out the turkeys in Tulsa rather than the tonkers in Yonkers. The part of Dwight was moulded for Sly Stallone and he is supported by some great casting, character development and a speedy script.

If you don't take it seriously, it's very enjoyable and easy on the brain. Nothing original about the Mafia and it's tentacles but some thoroughly dislikeable characters add the edge.

Stand out support from the likeable Dania Delaney as Maggie and Andrea Savage as PC Stacy. Neal McDonough and Domenick Lombardozzi are thoroughly dislikeable and the ones you love to hate. Go for it ! You will know within 5 minutes if the rubbish is gold plated for you !

Here's an UPDATE...latest series whatever but episode 4 it's really boring. Script has no sparkle, Stallone no sparkle, scenes no sparkle. Lost the plot but maybe there wasn't one.",figurative
"""It"" review, spoilers free I don't have much to say about ""It"", because it's a perfect horror masterpiece.

"Truly Delightful This was unbelievably entertaining. Ted Danson is amazing. He is charming, a little sexy and thoughtful.

I realize a lot of people think this is a mystery, a whodunnit, it is not. It's about how we treat the elderly and how they feel about it. It's about relationships and trust. It's a lesson in respect. And it's just so funny. Ted Danson ages like a fine wine, he just keeps getting better.

The supporting cast was so much fun. To see all these older actors and actresses come out of the woodwork for this was exciting and satisfying. A constant where are they now question.

Stephanie Beatriz was at her best!

I highly recommend it as light fun with a hidden lesson.",literal
"Great Performances, Minor Flaws: All Her Fault Reviewed All Her Fault delivers a compelling mix of gripping storytelling and standout performances, making it a series well worth your time. Michael Peña is an absolute highlight so captivating and natural in his delivery that you could easily watch an entire documentary series with just his voice guiding the narrative. His presence adds depth and warmth to every scene he touches.

Sarah Snook and Dakota Fanning, unsurprisingly, steal the show. Both bring a magnetic intensity and emotional precision that elevate the series beyond its genre roots. Their performances feel lived-in, layered, and consistently engaging.

Sophie Lillis is another bright spark, showing clear promise and a screen presence that hints at a strong future ahead. She holds her own alongside the seasoned cast, adding freshness to the ensemble.

While a few moments fall slightly short of the glamour or polish the series seems to reach for, the overall execution remains impressive. The performances are stellar across the board, and the storytelling stays tight and engaging.

In short, All Her Fault is a solid, enjoyable watch carried confidently by a talented cast and anchored by performances that linger long after the credits roll.",figurative
"A Fantastic Musical Disney have made some undoubtedly great films since the turn of the century, but with the notable exception of Tangled, their musicals have been a bit hit or miss. But with that said, wow is this a hit. All of these songs are just absolute bangers. 'How Far I'll Go' is beautiful, 'Shiny' is obviously iconic, the opening song is a fun introduction to the film and even 'You're Welcome' is an enjoyable time. This might just be the best Disney soundtrack since Hunchback, or at a push The Lion King, it's that good. Moana is a really well developed character, the animation is beautiful to look at and the ending wraps all of the character arcs and the main story up perfectly. All of the side characters are loveable and enjoyable, with Maui and Tamatoa being my personal favourites. The actual musical score is fantastic, the performances are solid - I just love so much of this film. As far as negatives go, some of the slapstick fell a bit flat, and I was kind of annoyed at the main-characters-splitting-up-before-the-climax trope that was used here. But still, just a fantastic film, and definitely one I'd recommend.",literal
"Enjoyable fun campy Ok it can be a bit silly. It's meant to be a bit over the top. It gets better as it goes on and finds its way. Kristen Wiig does a great job and Ricky Martin does a great job as as being the straight man (no pun was intended here) adding a layer of sanity to the crazy antics of the rest of the cast.

Carol Burnett's role increases throughout the season and she proves she still has it. It has a solid cast with most in the correct roles. There are one or two that are miscast but on the whole the show pulls it together. Good entertainment if you like campy over the top comedy that doesn't take itself seriously.",literal
"Japanese Taiko Drummers Invade the FBI! I have to say that, in general, I like the FBI /Most Wanted /International shows, but I find the sound track to be ANNOYING.

It seems that no scene of these shows should proceed without a thrumming, percussion-laden ""music"" track. ""Listen! This is building up suspense! Something IMPORTANT must be happening! PAY ATTENTION!"" It doesn't matter if we're watching a chase sequence, or just two people walking down a hall, the same background noise must prevail.

Someone, somewhere has decided that this is the kind of sound track that viewers should be subjected to in any kind of action/adventure show, and I'm getting sick of it. Nobody is going to win an Emmy for this kind of repetitive, annoying clangour.",literal
"Definitely a Show I Chose to Binge Watch When Nurse Jackie was originally on the air, I didn't have an interest in it. I was never a huge fan of Edie Falco, but this show changed my mind.

I have to admit, it wasn't the first episode that got me hooked, it took me a few episode to get the gist of what was going on for me to really start to love it. Each character's depictions truly represented a real life person. All the characters were relatable in one way or another. You could definitely feel for these characters. Even though Jackie did some deplorable things to support her habit, you could really see that her job and her daughters were super important to her. Even though her relationship with her husband it rocky, she will always care about him and her for her. It is very realistic to see the evolution of all the character's relationships between each other.

After season one, I couldn't put my iPad down. I watched and watched to see what would happen during each episode. I truly love each character and each episode brought something new to the table.

It was a great show, and I would love for it to either be resurrected or spun off some how.",literal
"I hate musicals. I really, truly, don't like musicals. If I want to see a play, I'll see a play, I've always thought musical cinema is derivative and cheesy. Wicked isn't really a departure from that thought. I DID find it somewhat watchable, though. If you love musicals, this will probably be a solid 10 for you.

The production is excellent, the acting is decent, but I'll be damned if I can remember a single song. Unlike the original Wizard of Oz, there really isn't anything to take away, musically. The lyrics are bland, and each song seems like a continuation of the others. With a runtime of nearly 3 hours, it would've been nice to have at least one or two decent songs.

So, to sum up, you'll love it if you love musicals, and if you don't, you won't.",literal
"My comfort show Oh boy, here we go.

I never liked Supernatural, I thought it was annoying and dumb. When Sarah Z's video about Destiel (SPN ship) came out, I put it on in the background while I did schoolwork, thinking I'd never watch the show in a million years. Soon after, I watched BBC Sherlock because the two main characters were in the Hobbit movies. I tried joining the Sherlock fandom, only to realize that almost everyone else there liked Supernatural along with it and I learned that SuperWhoLock was a thing.

So I continued to avoid Supernatural until I saw it on my Netflix suggested category. I gave up and watched the first episode. This was in January.

Fast forward to now and it's literally my favorite thing. I'm in the middle of season 4 right now and in love with Castiel. Okay I'm done. It's good.",literal
Cringe This isn't a cop show. It's a cringy drama where the some of the actors are playing cops in a badly written soap opera. The storyline was shallow and predictable.

"Engrossing I need to start a list of all the films that have cemented the fact I will never have children. 'If I Had Legs I'd Kick You' would go somewhere near the top. This movie was nightmare fuel.

This is one of those rare movies where there's no real plot or story, and yet you're still captivated by every moment. You need to know what will happen next. And it feels like anything could happen next, which is great feeling.

The final sequence was an interesting one and something I had to do some reading about to fully get my head around. I liked it but it wasn't quite the knockout blow I was hoping the movie would end with.

This is exactly the kind of movie where a Q&A with the director afterwards at Fantastic Fest would be a treat. To get their first hand interpretations on what certain things meant would be priceless.

Overall though I really enjoyed 'If I Had Legs I'd Kick You'. It was unique and it gives you a lot to think about. Throw in some great performances and you have a pretty engrossing couple of hours. 7/10.",literal
"Predictable Predictable - Having studied this particular historical moment, I was expecting more from this. Good soundtrack and acting. Nice inclusion of actual film from the trial.

"From Jag to 17 and counting seasons From JAG episode to 17 and counting Seasons . NCIS started off as very generic show with crime of the week that we saw thousands of times before only thing changed is that it surrounded the navy and the marines . But from season 3 the show changed, the coming of Ziva ,the story about Gibbs, the improvement in the writing plots made NCIS standout and become better show. The other characters Ziva Tony Abby McGee Ducky were all interesting and made me love NCIS more.

But from season 15 with the leaving of Ziva Tonny and Abby, it's not the same as it was. It's not awful some episodes still standout but the new characters are pale compère To the old characters. Even the writing is not as it used to .",literal
"Stumbles and falls. Glen Powell stars as Ben Richards, who signs up for a TV show where contestants are hunted by killers; if they can survive for 30 days, they win a fortune in prize money. Josh Brolin is the villain of the piece -producer Dan Killian - who will go to any lengths to ensure the show's popularity and high ratings.

The 1987 adaptation of Stephen King's The Running Man, starring everyone's favourite Austrian bodybuilder, is a lot of cheesy '80s action fun, but it's far from my favourite Schwarzenegger movie. That said, I'd rather rewatch Arnie dropping corny one-liners while battling cartoonish, colourful, over-the-top villains than sit through Edgar Wright's version for a second time. The tone of the new film feels all wrong - Wright attempts to combine satirical humour with hard hitting violence, but fails to pull off the trick: he's no Verhoeven. He should have either leaned into the campiness, as per the original film, or gone serious and super dark and ultra violent - in attempting to do both, he merely succeeds in making his film feel very uneven.

This new adaptation is also unnecessarily long (2 hrs and 13 mins), losing a lot of steam in the second half. I was willing to give the film a fair crack of the whip, 'cos when Wright is on form he is great, but I really found my mind wandering once the film passed the hour and a half mark. The action scenes fail to get the adrenaline pumping - I felt no jeopardy for Ben Richards whatsoever - and the humour doesn't land (only the Y/Why? Gag made me laugh). I really wanted this to be good, so it pains me to say that The Running Man is far from Wright's best work and will probably be forgotten about fairly quickly (unlike Arnie's film, which is a cult classic).

4.5/10, generously rounded up to 5 for IMDb.",literal
"Mixed emotions This was an interesting movie it's not bad, but definitely not amazing just an average watch,it's got potential but the pacing of the storyline was mediocre and felt very slow at times, making it hard to stay fully immersed in the movie it had its moments were a few funny scenes that actually landed well and broke up the tension nicely but this film also had alot of direction from the movie poor things 2023 which personally I didn't think was anything special What really became bizarre and really confusing was one specific scene I didn't see coming at all it genuinely shocked me in the best way possible because I wasn't expecting it at all.

As for the movie ending, it was a more on the comedic / goofy presence which didn't totally fit the tone of the rest of the movie but was at least a little bit of entertainment.",literal
"Predictable formula from the past It took all of 10 minutes in episode one to include climate change, politics, and blame.

No need to have context, the shows doesn't.

Witty banter and new medical devices in this show makes it Chi ago Hope/E. R. revisited. It's not as good.

Real hospitals are not like this. Real doctors are not like this.

This is a form of sensationlized & imaginary medical situations that appeal to those hopeful, not those who know.

I'm not a doctor nor do I play one on TV. Neither was Mandy Patinkon or George Clooney but they both portrayed caring professionals better than any person in this show.

Let's be brutal, if you think this is a real environment, you will be disappointed when you visit a hospital.",literal
"Still a very entertaining show I've watched NCIS right from the beginning and still find it very entertaining and watchable. Given some of the dross that I wade through to find something good to watch I wonder at all the people who comment on this board who are desperate for this show to end. What are they watching that's so much better? It is a very good ensemble cast and although that has changed over the years, it's still an interesting mix of people. I did wonder how it would be after the Gibbs character left, as he felt so integral to the show, but I didn't need to worry as Gary Cole is doing a great job. It's a different show to the original, but still going strong in my opinion, I look forward to it every year.",literal
"MUST WATCH I absolutely love this movie. This will be a new obsession movie for a long time. I really hope Netflix creates a sequel to the movie just because of the way that it ends off, but this overall has the best production music and everything else. If you haven't watched this, I would definitely recommend watching this, especially if you haven't listened to the music the music is really good and the people who are singer very talented. I can tell that this movie put a lot of thought into it and it was by far one of the best movies that I think I've ever seen all the actors in the voice actors are very talented and they did such a good job portraying everything. It was funny, sad, and joyful all at the same time and I definitely sobbed.",literal
"There are moments in life when a stranger... There are moments in life when a stranger can make you feel more understood than someone you've known for years - and sometimes that connection comes from the most unexpected places.

That's the feeling this film left me with.

Rental Family dives into Japan's rental-service industry-something that often gets misunderstood or written off as ""strange"" by people who aren't familiar with Japanese culture. But instead of treating it like a curiosity, Rental Family shows something deeper: the quiet emotional needs people have, the parts of themselves they can't openly reveal, and how rental services become a safe space to express those hidden truths.

There are situations where people can't show their true selves - not because they're emotionless, but because the cultural pressure to maintain harmony or meet expectations is incredibly strong. And when you can't openly express who you are or what you need, it becomes hard to feel seen or understood, even by the people closest to you.

Rental Family shows how these services can sometimes offer a rare, quietly powerful alternative - a way for someone to experience honesty, support, or connection in circumstances where they simply can't reveal the full truth to their real family or community. It's not about deception. It's about finding comfort, dignity, or emotional safety in a world where not everyone has the freedom to live openly, the way they wish for or is expected of them.

Brendan Fraser plays a foreigner living in Japan who speaks the language yet still doesn't quite fit in-a feeling many expats know all too well, including myself. He's unfulfilled at work, chasing purpose without even realizing what he's actually looking for. And then he's presented with a job he doesn't understand, nearly rejects, and ultimately discovers himself through. The fulfillment he finds doesn't come from success, money, or accolades, but from emotional connection in one of the most unconventional places. And that's the beauty of the movie.

It also reminded me of my own time in Japan. When I first arrived, new to the country and with very few friends, I actually looked into renting a boyfriend for my birthday-not as a joke, not out of desperation, but because the idea felt comforting. As someone who couldn't celebrate with anyone, it sounded like a brilliant way to create a meaningful memory. The agency told me the guy I chose wasn't available on the actual day, so it didn't happen. But I still think the concept is wonderful for people who need connection when they don't have access to it.

And then there are host clubs. They get a bad reputation, and I'm not promoting them, but taken the right way, they can give people a sense of warmth or companionship they may be missing - whether they're single, far from home, or simply craving connection in a safe, controlled environment. It's another one of those very Japan-specific situations that looks unusual from the outside but makes a surprising amount of emotional sense once you understand the culture.

Because the truth is this: everyone wants to feel seen, accepted, and understood - but in Japan, expressing those needs openly isn't always easy. Cultural expectations, social harmony, and family pressures can make honesty complicated. So these rental services become a rare, structured space where people can access feelings they can't show in their everyday lives. A quiet bridge between what they can't reveal and what they still deeply need.

That's what the film captures so beautifully: that beneath the surface - beneath the politeness, the social expectations, the silence - people still carry the same longing for connection that all of us do.

And that's why this film is worth watching.

By the way, I saw this at the pre-premiere screening - and the full release is on November 21st.

If you want a nuanced, heartfelt insight into a uniquely Japanese corner of human connection, go see this movie.",literal
"Dissappointing Spent the first half waiting for it to start. Watching the same events from a million different view points doesn't add anything and is incredibly boring. It doesn't cleverly come together as some have said, it's just unnecessary filler.

Second half is more of a spoof than a horror. I laughed a couple of times but at no point did I jump, feel on edge, or even get a creepy feeling from this film.",literal
"Just Horrendous and Predictible So (spoiler alert). The movie starts with a guy being told his employer's family has been murdered - or least some of them. By the finale it's never clear on this point.

Then - about ten minutes into the movie, you realize the ""bad guy"" is the bad guy, and is the one who committed all the mayhem leading to the murders. There. Skip watching the rest. No pathos, no depth, just a poorly written revenge movie that takes a whole season to tell you a worse story than every Clint Eastwood/Charles Bronsen movie does in less than two hours.

In watching the finale, I thought that maybe the reason the series was so horrendous was that the writers were caught up in some political point about the evils of capitalism - but then I realized it didn't even have that depth of thought. Just putrid. Nothing. Not a single redeeming quality - other than, perhaps, the beauty of the Greek Islands. Skip it. Trust me on this.",literal
"One of the stupidest movies I've seen in a long time I went into Bugonia without having seen the original Korean film it's based on (Save the Green Planet!), but even without that comparison point, this remake is a misfire from start to finish. What could have been a sharp satire ended up as a frustratingly juvenile film instead.

From the outset, the film struggles to justify its own premise. We're told in the synopsis that two men are convinced the CEO of a pharmaceutical company is an alien. But the storytelling never lays groundwork for that belief. There's no buildup, no evidence, no psychological exploration -- just a scattered, generalized conversation between the two men with abrupt cross-cutting to the woman in question going about her day, followed by a very sudden kidnapping. The audience is left bewildered why she's targeted, or why they believe she's an alien, and the narrative offers no breadcrumbs to follow.

Only much later do we learn that the CEO is connected to the men thru their dying mother, whose illness was allegedly caused by a drug manufactured by the company. This revelation would have been better served as the emotional and narrative foundation of the film, not a later stage casual info drop. Had that connection been established early, with some parallel to the alien angle, we might have had a chance to understand their paranoia or empathize with their motivations.

The script is another casualty. Dialogue thruout the film is either clunky or childish, never once landing with wit or weight. And while the portrayal of conspiracy theorists is meant to be exaggerated for effect, it is caricature so extreme it becomes offensive. The film parodies rather than explores their character, which only sabotages any thematic depth it might have been aiming for.

Visually, there are moments of enjoyment. The litany of tracking shots, in particular, are well-executed and add a sense of style to an otherwise mediocre storyboard.

By the time the big twist arrives -- one that's so telegraphed it barely qualifies as a twist -- I was already long disengaged. Bugonia wants to be provocative, and emotionally or intellectually resonant, but it only comes across as insulting and imbecilic. I left the theater actually disgusted, relieved that the ordeal was finally over.",literal
"Refreshingly simple and fun With even the John Wick franchise now getting chock-full of complex lore, it was nice to sit down with a small-scale action thriller with toned-down stakes and gleefully destructive violence.

The silent protagonist gets a few small satisfying moments of character, and the quick runtime & simple premise kept the movie engaging and a more-than-pleasant watch.

That being said, this definitely isn't a groundbreaking piece of work by any means-it lacks the polished direction and awe-inspiring stunt work of other recent action flicks, and the writing dives too far into absurdity.

My suspension of disbelief can only stretch so far with a gritty movie like this, and this film surpassed the limit many times with implausibility piled on top of implausibility.

I liked the unpretentious, funny, and zany nature of Sisu and had a good time with it, even if it's not something special that I'll come back to.",figurative
"If you like this Superman movie, more power to you. I am rating this movie 6 out of 10. There's something very off about it, and the closest I can describe it is ""meta."" This is the kind of movie that Superman, in a real Superman film, would be watching on TV. Do you understand what I'm getting at? This isn't a real Superman movie; it's some kind of knockoff, much in the way the all-female ""Ghostbusters"" was a parody of a real ""Ghostbusters"" movie.

I know James Gunn is trying to build a DC Universe, but I just can't feel it. I'm not interested in seeing the next installment.

There is far too much talking in this film. The interview scene, for instance, went on for way too long. They could have easily cut half an hour, making it a 90-minute movie instead of two hours. I didn't really care about any of the characters. The robots were cool, I guess, but the dog was annoying.

Ultimately, I hope somebody likes it. If you enjoy it, that's fine. I'm not going to fault you for it. You have a right to like what you like, and if you like this Superman movie, then more power to you.",literal
"Truthful review to help potential viewer set expectations I was home sick for 2 days and watched this in its entirety. I'm the kind of person who once starts watching a series will usually see it through. I wish this was 2-3 episodes shorter. They could have done it and it would not have felt so long and had a lot of the ridiculous things happen that did not seem to add any value. That said, the fact I'm posting on this (unusual) means both the show has grabbed my attention and also left me confused and disappointed and I came looking for answers. The reviews that mention huge plot holes are right on. UNLESS, there is some VERY clever writing and it has been done purposefully in a longer story arc. If you watch network TV shoes (CSI) and want to step up, this might be a satisfying show. If you like and keep track of character arcs on HBO drama's, this will feel thinly written.",literal
"Very nice Christmas Movie Great for fans of Jonas Brothers and/or their Disney show.

Bean back on the screen together, they kept everything as light and fun as their original TV show. This was put together very well. Some funny dialogue and the need to watch it more than wants to pick up all the lines.

I believe this will go in a few People's Christmas watchlist for years to come.",literal
"Chicago Fire Shows dealing with fire departments has came a long way since the show Emergency with Squad 51 to Chicago Firehouse 51. Chief Boden seems to always some kind of problem going on every day. But in the end he always figures out and solves the problem quickly. Lt. Casey and Severide does a great job holding the crew together through thick or thin. They picked great actors to play those roles. I love Mouch, he is awesome! Great role for him. Christopher Herrmann sounds like it's hard for him to make it to be a fireman, let alone to run a bar. But I have to say he does do a good job at it. All the crew of Firehouse 51 are great and when it comes down to it they do their job right and get the situations under control fast but safely. I like how the writers bring into the show each of the fireman's personal life's. I hope Chicago Fire goes a long way. Keep up the great work!",literal
"STOP CASTING ADULTS AS TEENS I don't know growing trend with shows and films where they cast of grown adult female to play a teenage girl... It's not convincing and it's almost insulting to our intelligence. They did this in the new Leonardo DiCaprio movie where a 25-year-old woman (Chase Infiniti) is playing a 16-year-old and they're doing it again in this where Silvia Dionicio is 26 years old and We're supposed to believe she's in high school. Give us a break, are there no talented teen actresses???",literal
"Would be better as non-Holmes It is a really interesting medical trauma with good acting. Pleasant scenery, not boring cases, interesting actors. But the thing that's ruining this show for me is that a sort of Sherlock Holmes universe? There has been done so many shows at this universe it is already overused and annoying.

The whole Moriarty premise trying to drug Watson is beyond amateur and takes significant amount of showtime that could be well spent on developing characters.

The previous medical drama Rosewood was excellent, this is not near to be on the same level.

I wish they could dial down all this nonsense connecting this show to the Sherlock Holmes, etc.",literal
"Don't waste your time I rarely ever write reviews, but felt called to write one about Wayward. The plot and story line had so much potential, but man did they drop the ball. The casting was just wrong, and that was showed by how horrible the acting was. Seemed so beyond forced by the adults. Just felt so amateur. The teens that were casted did well and were the only saving grace.",literal
"The future IS the 80's Of all Arnold's mid-'80s movies who would have thought that most relevant today would be The Running Man. A chilling and surprisingly realistic tale of reality TV gone mad. It may have been far-fetched back then but not so now. Not when you think about it. Currently, Reality TV shows are either scraping the bottom of the barrel or desperate to raise the bar. If the next one isn't more controversial as the last, it's a dud. How long will it be before we really do see shows like The Running Man? How long before we have 'court-appointed theatrical attorneys' or the entertainment division of the Justice Department? There is so much satire and intelligence in this movie that may have been missed back in 1987 that is desperate to be seen again considering the current state of TV shows.

The biggest message of all is 'You are being lied to'. It's no secret that the Government and the media work in cahoots. And the masses believe what the media tells them to believe. It's a very scary state of affairs and unless more accurate representations of the truth emerge we may easily accept a brutal show like the Running Man in the near future. It's no secret that Reality TV is not very realistic. It's edited and reshaped before being aired and it's only what the networks want you to see. Usually it's far from the real truth.

Although rather different than Stephen King's book (the ending is completely changed) the script does conform to the typical Arnie formula. Yes, he does have numerous and very corny one-liners and he does say 'I'll be back' (which he never REALLY said that often anyway, when you think about it) in the most ironic situation yet but he's still a zillion times better in the role then Christopher Reeve or Dolph Lundgren would have been (these two were considered BEFORE Arnie believe it or not).

The director is none other than Dave Starsky himself (Paul Michael Glaser). It may not be artistic but it is still strong enough to generate excitement and his use of neon and flourescent colors gives each individual set a pretty cool look. Andrew Davis (not a director I particularly like) was attached before Glaser, though no matter who directs, the film is still marred by a very heavy 80's feel.

First of all, Harold Faltermeyer's score (remember him?) is incredibly dated and robs the action scenes of any timeless integrity. And the fashion sense of the movie is far too excessive to be convincingly set in the future. Apart from the dated feel, the only other thing that bugs me is the poorly staged shoot-out that passes as the climax.

This new DVD is a zillion times better than the original release. Gone is the horrid letterbox picture. In its place is a brand new hi-definition 1.85:1 anamorphic transfer. The colors sparkle and literally pop from the screen. The new Dolby 5.1 EX and DTS ES soundtrack are also amazing. There constant use of the surround channels to great effect and the bass is strong and powerful. Definitely one of the best re-masters I've seen so far. Two intriguing documentaries, a trailer and a 'Meet the Stalkers' gimmick are included in this 2-disc set that comes in a rather neat slip case.",figurative
"Glossy But Too Familiar THREE WISEST MEN I Third in the Christmas-family series, Three Wisest Men is more of the same Hallmark-esque gloss and hijinks. Even though all three leads have pedigree in the genre they still are all acting in separate films and never feel as gelled as the script wants them too. Margaret Colin continues to be a commanding presence as their mother. Terri Ingham's direction is typical copy/paste of similar movies before it.",literal
"Intense and Relentless The Pitt is from the same producers who brought us the iconic medical series E. R. Initially, I tried to stay disconnected and distant, and managed to remain somewhat aloof for about six or seven episodes. But by episode eight, it sucked me into its grinder, minced me up, and spat me out. It's intensely tough viewing-you're repeatedly battered by heartbreaking emergencies. You find yourself deeply invested in patients, like one man who falls off a ladder and finally recovers enough to be extubated, only to discover that his wife had secretly been medicating him to suppress his libido, suspecting he might be molesting their daughter. The show isn't just about what's happening in the ER-it's about the relentless emotional toll constantly battering you. Each episode covers just one hour in a 12-hour shift, but the relentless waves of trauma leave you questioning how anyone could survive a career doing this day after day.",literal
Peak asf Friend recommended me this movie as a joke and i did not take it seriously at all. I saw that it had a decent rating on this site and decided to watch it as a joke with him and another friend. This was one of the best decisions i could've made. This movie was like uncovering a treasure that had been forgotten and overlooked. It was a god level movie with top tier EVERYTHING. Thought this was going to be horrible but it changed my life forever. I immediately stumbled across 100 millions dollars in my yard and my amputated leg grew back. WATCH THIS MOVIE ASAP IT IS SO GOOD 10/10. Bobby the goat.,figurative
"Felt like a buddy cop movie This movie could have been amazing. Just the mere concept of telling a Yatkuja story is bold, and makes this worth a watch. However, it didn't quite follow through.

It started off amazing with action and little passion. Even it didn't start becoming lame until early in the second act. It became too light hearted. And by the third act it felt less like Arnold's original predator and more like a family movie.

Dek was amazing. The world building and the Yatkuja passion for violence couldn't have been introduced better. Dakota fanning was ok.

I think the faults really boil down to the directors choice to go all family/team on us. That is lame, and this was definitely a missed opportunity.",literal
I don't get it.. After 15 seasons and 2 episodes of the 16th. I can honestly say 'I am addicted'.

"He's done it again -- and might even have outdone himself While the first 8 months of 2025 weren't anything spectacular in terms of movies (unless you lived where I live and got stuff like Nickel Boys and The Brutalist during the winter and early spring), the year's festival season entailed some mighty promising titles. When I saw that the latest Yorgos Lanthimos-Emma Stone collaboration had scored 100% on Rotten Tomatoes and even won over certain Lanthimos nay-sayers after its Venice premiere, I knew we were gonna eat good this autumn. (This is to say nothing of the buzz around One Battle After Another, as well as Park Chan-wook, Chloe Zhao, et al., but more on them another time.)

Based on Jang Joon-hwan's Save the Green Planet, Bugonia is the tale of two conspiracy theorists -- or rather, one conspiracy theorist and his less-than-adroit cousin -- kidnapping a Big Pharma CEO whom they believe is an Andromedan extraterrestrial, complicit in a grand master plot to mess up the ecosystem, make humans into obsequious drones, conquer us via division, and whatever else is secretly going on behind the scenes of our shared bedlam. They believe she can be persuaded, or forced, to contact the Mothership and get the Andromedans to leave us be.

This is a marvelous film, and further rumination and a rewatch may force me to conclude it's the best work of both Lanthimos and Stone's careers. I know I say this almost every time there is a new Emma Stone film -- especially one where she works with Lanthimos -- but she truly is at that level.

Jesse Plemons is also superb, which is once again expected, but there is something truly special about how he here captures the incorrigibility and main character syndrome of conspiracy theorists (who have only gotten worse with time; the film partly examines why), as well as the way they snap during conversations when they realize the sheer irremdiable wrongness of the narrative they've made their raison d'être. The big ""find"", to use Brandon Streussnig's phrasing, is Aidan Delbis, who knocks it out of the park as the slow-witted cousin.

I can admit a few issues with the film; more negative reviews posit that its social commentary -- its satire of girlboss feminism, late-stage capitalism, political labels, the yearning for purpose, and just humanity's trajectory in general -- occasionally sounds a bit obvious and shallow. It doesn't have the Poor Things excuse of filtering everything through an infant-brained Frankenstein-ian creature, but I do think the comments that people are referring to (some of them, at least) work well enough for the context in which we hear them: which characters speak the dialogue and what exactly they're attempting to convey to each other.

Like Poor Things, Bugonia has of course also come under fire from the ""depiction v endorsement"" understanders, who think Lanthimos gets a kick out of putting women through Hell in his movies. This is not (and has never been) anything more than a 2020s sequel to Roger Ebert's pearl-clutching about women in the films of David Lynch. (I'm sure Emma Stone -- the film's co-producer, by the way -- is just as aghast to be forced to work with Lanthimos as Dern, Lee, Watts, and Rossellini were with Lynch.) And while I can understand why critics find it weird that Lanthimos changed the torture-and-kidnapping victim from male to female, is it not also weird that y'all more clearly understand that the torture is bad when it's happening to a male character (Save the Green Planet) than to a female one (Bugonia), in which case you need someone to look into the camera and clarify it to us (read: you)?

I will also say this (if we must speak about the potentially harmful impact of Bugonia): There is a good chance IRL conspiracy theorists will be humored by this picture -- yes, in spite of the fact that they are being critiqued.

I mentioned before that the portrayal is strikingly accurate, and I very much speak from first-hand experience (I have even done exactly what Stone's character does, being forced to correct their grammar but then joking about how speaking correctly must surely also be part of the grand master plot to ""indoctrinate"" us through education). I am thus painfully aware that they think films like this prove them right, not DESPITE satirizing them, but because of it: the movie exists specifically as an NWO-mandated countermeasure to make them look silly, on top of signaling what's next in the reptilian scheme, because confession protects them from bad karma or something. (Even the depiction of Flat Earth, which initially looks to be floating in space, which more and more tinfoilers don't even believe exists, turned out to be -- essentially -- accurate to how they think our realm functions.)

But then, on the other hand, conspiracy theorists may feel that parts of the movie ""get to the bottom"" of them -- the theorists, I mean -- to such an uncomfortable degree that they might not run with it. It isn't wholly accurate to say that the text mocks these people wholesale. There may be jokes at their expense, but it does endeavour to understand where this brand of working-class wreck comes from, and why so many have gone down this path in recent years.

Dunning-Kruger narcissism (wanting to be smarter than experts, and those damned ""normies"" who blindly agree with facts) and lockdown-induced brain rot only explain some of it, as I noted in my 2023 Conspiracy Guide parody. But Bugonia acknowledges the desperation that lower-class folks find themselves in, in this age of illness, death, and ever-so-hopeless visions of the future; the desperation to sense that there's some great master plan that ties everything together so that reality makes a lot more sense than it actually does. In a sense, though, something does indeed tie it all together: late capitalist society -- a world where everyone has nothing, and more and more is taken from them -- created many of these wretches.

Anywho, what else did I like? Well, as is par for the Lanthimos course, there is plenty of personality to the cinematography and editing; the black-and-white flashback sequences have a particular pulsating rhythm to them. Then there's Jerskin Fendrix's awesome music, which sounds a bit like if John Williams' Star Wars score went to Hell and came back again.

It is true that I am a sucker for movies with this particular view of humanity -- and the future we may all be headed towards, however much we cling to this or that ideology/deity/""explanation"" as doom nonchalantly creeps ever closer. But I think most of the objections to Bugonia are fairly meaningless (and can be excused by its status as a comedic satire) and that you should all watch it. As Streussnig's review also notes, you might even discover a certain emotional resonance to it that makes it stand out from Lanthimos' other, supposedly ""just plain kooky"" works.

A friend wrote that you might like the film more if you dislike Lanthimos (supposing you're not one of the aforementioned ""nothing bad must ever happen to lady characters"" bloggers). As far as I'm concerned, however, he's done it again!

I am beyond glad this man gets the freedom he does in Hollywood. Maybe, as much as the Andromedans would disagree, there is some hope for us all. Oh, and before I forget: Yes, Stavvys' gut looks exactly as epic on the big screen as you've heard.",figurative
"Great story and characters ""NCIS: Origins"" is an exciting and solid prequel that delves into the origins of the franchise's most beloved characters, especially the young Gibbs. The plot successfully captures the essence of what made NCIS so popular, while also introducing new layers of story and character development. The cast does an exceptional job, especially the actor portraying young Gibbs, who manages to convey both the toughness and vulnerability of the character. The 90s setting is perfectly executed, with details that fans of the era will appreciate even more. The series balances action and drama well, with an engaging narrative that keeps interest from the first episode. If you're a fan of NCIS or enjoy crime and action stories with an emotional touch, this show is definitely worth a watch. Highly recommended!""",literal
"Absolutely incredible!! Don't know why this doesn't have a higher score. It is the best thriller I have ever seen as a mini-series or TV show. Claire Danes gives the performance of a lifetime, surpassing even her work on Homeland in terms of nuance, as well as breadth and depth. Matthew Rhys plays the perfect narcissistic sociopath. The direction is superb, an incredible building of suspense. The writing is very good, not 'high art' but great for what it is. If you enjoy a good Fincher-style psychological thriller with excellent acting that will keep you on the edge of your seat and has enough smarts, this is an excellent choice.",literal
"Worse than Willy Wonka starring timothy chardonnay, and that says alot I wanted to like this movie so bad but throughout the entire movie my friend and i kept thinking ""when is it getting scary and good, when do we actually understand ANYTHING.

It seemed like the person that made the movie was more interested in the scenery rather then the actual story. I got the feeling a very egotistic man was behind this and just LOVING this thinking its award worth shii. No questions was answered in the film and if the director wanted to make the audience question the story he did it in a very lazy way. Cuz im not wondering i dont even remember anything bro.

Cheap jump scares that had zero substance to the story. The main actress did everything she could with what she got. Poor her man. She must have the worst backpain after carrying that entire movie. I recommend to not pay to go see this film, download it or something, not worth the pain.",literal
"What a great start!!! TBH, This show popped up as I opened the HBO/Max app, and I drilled into it on accident.

After reading a brief synopsis I decided to give it a try as I had an hour to ""kill"" (no pun intended). Wow, what starts as a peek into the lives of two families on opposite sides of the law, eventually converges to the scene of a gruesome crime; a robbery gone wrong. The events that lead up to the scene lay the groundwork for what I feel will be another hit crime drama for the Network.

With Mark Ruffalo and Tom Pelphrey at the helm, you can expect a great product. For a show that I had no background on, and didn't anticipate, I am thoroughly happy that I have discovered a new show to look forward to in the weeks to come.",literal
"Masterpiece ""Better Call Saul"" stands out as a masterpiece in television history for its impeccable storytelling, complex characters, and brilliant craftsmanship. Set as a prequel to the renowned series ""Breaking Bad,"" it delves deep into the evolution of the beloved character, Saul Goodman, portrayed by the exceptional Bob Odenkirk. What makes ""Better Call Saul"" extraordinary is its meticulous attention to detail, meticulously weaving together intricate plotlines that captivate audiences from start to finish. The show's character development is unparalleled, allowing viewers to witness the transformation of Jimmy McGill into the morally ambiguous lawyer, Saul Goodman, with depth and nuance. The moral ambiguity of its characters adds layers of complexity, making every decision and action thought-provoking and compelling. The writing is sharp and intelligent, filled with witty dialogue and subtle nods to its predecessor, ""Breaking Bad."" Moreover, the cinematography and direction elevate the storytelling, creating visually stunning scenes that immerse viewers in the gritty world of Albuquerque. From its gripping courtroom drama to its heart-wrenching personal struggles, ""Better Call Saul"" offers a rich and multifaceted narrative that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. Its exploration of themes such as morality, ambition, and the pursuit of identity resonates deeply with audiences, provoking introspection and sparking conversations long after the credits roll. In essence, ""Better Call Saul"" is not just a television show; it's a work of art that sets the standard for excellence in storytelling and cements its place as one of the greatest shows of all time.",figurative
Silly fun I've never seen the British version so I'm rating this only on its own merits. It's is hilarious. It's over the top but on a good way. Great ensemble cast who could settle into being less caricatures and more interesting. Fix the direction and this is a good show with good writing.,literal
"An immensely bingeable, infectiously funny thrill ride! When the initial episodes of 'Only Murders in the Building' started raking in 100% on Rotten Tomatoes, I must confess that I was skeptical that Steve Martin and co could keep up the quirky fun nature of this comedy-thriller series till the last episode.

But Martin Short, Selena Gomez and him form an unlikely yet rambunctious trio who keep us hooked and entertained till the very last episode of this brilliantly written, infectiously funny series.

Steve Martin and a fantastic Martin Short star as a pair of geriatric has-been performers who run into a young gild (Gomez) who also happens to be a fellow murder podcast fanatic. How this rag-tag trio come together to solve a strange murder that takes place in their apartment forms the rest of this story.

Although some comedy-investigative series' have had huge fan bases like Monk (2002-09) and Psych (2006-14) this genre has always been a tightrope walk that most creators shy away from.

Finding humor in the most unlikeliest of places and filled with unexpected twists and turns and a host of delectable supporting characters, it is no surprise that Steve Martin was also one of the creative geniuses behind the writing of this work.

Leaving us on a tantalizing knife-edge with a cliffhanger climax, I cannot wait for Season 2. Well worth the 100% Rotten Tomatoes rating. An immensely bingeable, suspenseful, laugh riot!

Highly recommended!",literal
"Another Sterlin Harjo masterpiece! Sterlin steps back up to the plate, without Taika's Watiti's help this time, and knocks it out of the park. His excellent ""Reservation Dogs"" (also on Hulu) was a brilliant character and location-centric series that should be shown in movie direction/production classes. An absolutely brilliant series that, in my opinion, should NOT have been marketed as a comedy.

Sterlin's obvious love of his home state of Oklahoma is evident in both series, and his direction makes us love it, too. The scenery brought me right into the story and kept me intrigued. He and Ethan Hawke obviously worked well together during the final few shows of ""RezDogs"", and I'm happy to see Ethan leading this cast. He has a great ""everyman"" sense that engages us viewers and keeps us interested in the next scene. The casting department brought in some really impressive characters for Ethan to work with, too. I feel safe in saying Sterlin is an ""actor's director"" and maintains an enjoyable, open-input type set. I predict a huge future ahead for him.

Sterlin has also surrounded himself with a talented behind-the-scenes crew. As of this writing there are only three episodes avaliable (of the eight in the season), but I'm already a big fan of the cinematography, scoring, and set direction. All three of those departments nicely maintains the same feel of the script and overall ""dusty, lower-middle class Midwest"" storyline.

I'm hooked! Great job, Sterlin Harjo and crew.",figurative
"The worst movie I've ever watched While I'm a fan of Jennifer Lawrence and Robert Pattinson, I really can't like it. The theme is meaningful, but the way they illustrate it is awful, and even vulgar, making people confused. It's fine to be abstract, but it shouldn't be plain and dull. Also if you already have depression, watching this will be really overwhelming: it tried to unfold sth but never really worked.",literal
"Good Mix of Everything! If you are looking for a mindless series with a good mix of drama, comedy, action, suspense all wrapped in one, you have come to the right place! The acting is amazing from all, especially Ethan! He is brilliant as Lee and did not disappoint. And the supporting cast are equally amazing, so if you aren't looking for a bit of everything in each episode, this is the show for you!",literal
Most selfish characters in a series I saw this back when it came out and then saw it again this year. I realized how annoyingly selfish all the characters were. The series had potential but fell woefully short.,literal
"It's always something! I love the show. Only half way through the third episode and there it is, our star confidently states; ""Well, when 11,000 gallons of crude oil hits 100 octane av-gas, it tends to go boom"". Let's assume he's referring to the impact, because I don't know why crude petroleum mixing with refined petroleum would go boom. However I do know that the plane used in this story is a Beechcraft 1900, and has turbine engines. It doesn't burn avgas! It burns jet fuel, which is basically kerosene, and does not explode unless subjected to extreme pressure. As a show about oil and blue collar workers, you would think they would do their research and at least try not to look like idiots!",literal
"Melodramatic tripe I'm probably going to keep watching it but the actors are pretty bad and everything is so over-dramatic. Kind of surprised given Mark Harmon is involved.

Seems like ""Gibbs"" is forever going off the rails and Franks is wrapped as tight as piano wire. Acting seems forced and uneven at best. Hoping it gets better as the show develops but I'm guessing the show gets canceled.

Arguments in the dialog erupt constantly which only makes the drama seem all the more forced. Dialog after dialog seems forced and uneven and emotion forced as well.

Instead of what would seem to be a professional organization everything is over the top.",literal
"Absolute excellence by Disney AGAIN !! Moana (or Vaiana in my country and many other European countries) is an animated musical adventure directed by John Musker and Ron Clements. It is the second Disney movie this year after the incredible Zootopia that was released back in February, and now I can say it is the second incredible movie released by Disney in 2016. Moana is a very interesting and touching movie about a girl named Moana (Vaiana) who dreams of sailing the world. She is voiced by Auli'i Cravalho who does a fantastic job on the role with her insanely talented voice, singing all the wonderful songs that will very soon be considered as classics. Dwayne Johnson is great (as per usual) as Maui - a legendary shapeshifting demigod. He brings such a fun, lovely, and comforting voice to his character that very few actors can do. And he is great at singing too, which was a surprise for me. It also has great animation, with incredible visuals as we've come to expect in Disney movies nowadays. I truly believe that in this decade, Disney has absolutely taken over the reigns in the film industry, and especially on the animation side of things. With movies like Tangled, Wreck-it Ralph, Frozen, Big Hero 6, Zootopia and now Moana, Disney shows no sign of stopping in their road to greatness and taking over the world.",literal
"Good but needed to finish in S1! This is one of those series which is made well performed well by actors directed well, good screenplay, good background music, but at end of all the episodes needs to end as a limited series. Unfortunately, it does not! It especially seems to have become a thing with Netflix series. I don't know why. Needless to say it generates more revenue from viewing hours for Netflix, but on the other hand, it is becoming a torture for the viewers to not get redemption at the end of a series like this which definitely did not need another season. This story with all its good characters and a good story would have been perfect to finish at the end of season one. It is definitely going to be stretched into next season rather a boring one, I am already predicting and forecasting. Here is the request to Netflix to not stretch what does not need to be. Thanks in advance Netflix! I have taken away one star for that reason alone!",literal
"""The closer you think you are,the less you'll actually see."" Talking to a family friend about a friends upcoming birthday,I was happily caught by surprise,when he revealed that he had picked up a film to give as a gift,due to it having ""inspired"" the Bollywood flick Dhoom 3,which led to me getting ready to step into the magic circle.

View on the film:

Whilst the guys do dominate the flick,the two girls shine in magical performances,with the very pretty Isla Fisher (who almost drowned when a scene which has Henley Reeves fail to get out a water tank,turned into Fisher being unable to get out of a faulty tank) giving Reeves a sassy curl of the lips,whilst an elegant Mélanie Laurent gives the title a perfect light touch.

Always kept one step behind the magicians, Mark Ruffalo gives an excellent performance as Dylan Rhodes,thanks to Ruffalo avoiding the easy option of making Rhodes look like a hapless idiot,by displaying intense desperation in pulling the bottom card from everyone else's pack.

Reuniting from the Batman movies,Michael Caine & Morgan Freeman both give charming performances,with Caine barking orders at everyone,whilst Freeman walks across the title with a wide, charismatic grin. Addressing the viewer at the start of the film, Jesse Eisenberg gives a very good performance as J. Daniel Atlas,whose showmanship hides nerves of doubt over their tricks being a success,as Eisenberg's former Zombieland star Woody Harrelson chews the scenery with a hilariously dry wit.

Increasing the elaborateness of each magicians act,the screenplay by Ed Solomon/Boaz Yakin and Edward Ricourt casts a dazzling twist ending over the film,which whilst coming from a rather left-field position,gives the magic an unexpected darkness,as the writers reveal the ""final trick"" that the magicians have been playing from the very start.

 Although the writers do use magic to make some leaps in logic disappear,they keep the movie moving at a sparkling pace,by turning the magicians into a gang of outlaws,whose heists go from a misdirection bank robbery to transforming into falling money.

Capturing every wave of the wand,director Louis Leterrier and cinematographers Mitchell Amundsen & Larry Fong build a thrilling atmosphere with stylish frantic scatter-shot camera moves,as the gang casts their spells in order to stay ahead of the cops. Diving into Las Vegas,Leterrier brilliantly uses vast wide shots to capture the spectacle and every gasp that the audience makes,as Leterrier grips the viewer and casts a spell,which reveals that the closer you think you are, the less you'll actually see.",figurative
"Take the long view This had 2 strikes against it in the first few episodes. It was really raunchy in the interaction between the two sisters and their parents. I'm in the oldest possible generation but I can't believe even Gen Z women talk that candidly with their parents. And actually these two sisters were in their 30's so I would think they would be slightly more inhibited.

The other flaw came with the introduction of the members of the rabbi's family. They were so stereotyped they made the Goldbergs look like Episcopalians.

Fortunately, as the story unfolded,the tone got less over-the-top, and the characters more believable.

What really set this story apart was the same honesty Kristen Bell brings to all her characters. Her courage in standing up for what she believes in and never apologizing just to get along is so refreshing.

I binged the whole series today and feel sure the gods will provide a second season.",literal
"Crama dramas are usually the best Slyvester Stallone is a legend!

10 episodes where a mafia capo is exiled from his family after 25 years in prison and you will empathize every minute of it.

I liked the show, but maybe it's because I'm a big fan of Sly. It is possible to come across cliches from time to time, as if the story was formed when many movies and TV series came together.

However, it easily adapts the audience to the story with its fast pace, simple script and pretty good acting. While watching you will not see any nonsense that you would think ""what is this?"" Everything works in harmony with real life. Keep punching, Sly! God bless you.",literal
"Mixed feelings... On the positive side, ""Nobody Wants This"" is a very stylish and clever show. Kristen Bell and Justine Lupe (Astrid on Mrs. Maisel) play sisters who host a sex and dating podcast, one similar to Call Her Daddy. Adam Brody is the newly single ""hot Rabbi"" who broke off a long-term relationship with Rebecca because he knew in his heart she wasn't the one. Kristen Bell's Joanne meets Adam Brody's Noah at a dinner party and their chemistry is instant. We watch their relationship develop over the series even though initially they have nothing in common (except they both have wealthy families) and are polar opposites. Noah is an honest, moral, straitlaced Conservative Jew who grew up aspiring to be a Rabbi. Joanne is a hip, modern, agnostic, freewheeling hot mess with a zigzag past. Noah and Joanne navigate multiple family and career issues that arise because of their relationship. The biggest hurdle they face, however, is that Joanne is not Jewish. Being with a ""shiksa"" causes his family great anguish and also puts his goal of becoming senior Rabbi at his synagogue in serious jeopardy.

It's a fun show to watch. The acting is phenomenal, the dialogue is witty. It's hysterically funny at times. The entire cast is fantastic with some endearing and charming characters.

The downside: Too many Jewish stereotypes to the point of it being almost a parody. It started out funny at times, but increasingly it felt more uncomfortable as the Jewish women characters were being portrayed as the villains while the blonde non-Jews were seen as the heroines. Also, Rabbi Noah is almost too perfect. He literally doesn't have a single character flaw. I feel that we didn't really get to know him or understand why he became so quickly invested in his relationship with Joanne.

Overall a good show. Looking forward to and fingers crossed for Season 2!",figurative
"Incredible show but my review is based off of one season ""Doc"" is a television series that premiered on Disney+ in 2025, after its original run on Fox, and it stands out as one of the most compelling shows of recent years. From the very first episode, the series grabs you by the collar and refuses to let go, immersing you in a world that's both intensely dramatic and emotionally resonant. The storytelling is carefully layered, blending suspense, intrigue, and human drama into a seamless narrative that keeps you guessing while also giving the characters room to breathe and develop. Each episode is meticulously structured, balancing high-stakes conflict with intimate character moments, making binge-watching feel almost impossible to resist.

At the center of it all is Amy, the lead actress, whose performance is nothing short of phenomenal. She embodies a character who is multidimensional-flawed, vulnerable, intelligent, and fiercely determined. Watching her navigate challenges, make morally ambiguous choices, and confront her own demons is a masterclass in acting. There are moments when you feel frustrated by her decisions, moments when you are moved by her vulnerability, and moments when you cheer for her victories with an intensity that few shows manage to evoke. Amy's ability to command the screen while maintaining the subtle nuances of her character is what makes ""Doc"" so immersive.

The supporting cast also deserves high praise, particularly Heller and Gina. Heller's character development is substantial, evolving in ways that are unpredictable yet believable, providing a strong counterbalance to Amy's intensity. Gina brings warmth, empathy, and a grounded perspective that helps anchor the series emotionally. The relationships between these characters are complex and layered, ranging from deep camaraderie to tension-filled confrontations, all of which feel natural and integral to the narrative. Each interaction is carefully crafted, revealing hidden layers and motivations that make the story feel both intricate and real.

In addition to the performances, the direction and production quality of ""Doc"" elevate it far above typical television fare. The director demonstrates a keen eye for composition, pacing, and visual storytelling. Scenes are framed with intention, whether to heighten suspense, emphasize character isolation, or underscore emotional beats. The cinematography, lighting, and set design all contribute to an immersive atmosphere, creating a world that feels lived-in and palpable. Music and sound design further complement the series, subtly amplifying tension, emotion, and thematic resonance without ever feeling intrusive.

Another standout aspect of ""Doc"" is the way the series balances episodic storytelling with an overarching narrative. Each episode offers a satisfying arc while also contributing to a larger, season-long storyline, creating a rhythm that keeps viewers engaged without ever feeling repetitive or forced. Plot twists are well-executed and often catch you off-guard, but they never feel contrived; they emerge organically from the characters' decisions and the narrative context. This careful attention to pacing and storytelling allows the series to maintain suspense while also giving viewers the emotional depth and character insight that makes it memorable.

Perhaps what makes ""Doc"" truly exceptional is how immersive and rewatchable it is. I completed the entire first season in just two days, yet even after finishing, I found myself going back to rewatch certain scenes to catch subtleties I missed the first time. The show is layered with small details-gestures, expressions, and visual cues-that enhance character development and deepen the emotional impact. It's a series that rewards attention and reflection, offering new insights with each viewing.

In addition, ""Doc"" succeeds in creating a world that feels lived-in and authentic. The characters are flawed, their struggles are relatable, and the stakes always feel real. The writing is sharp and precise, tackling difficult topics without feeling heavy-handed, and allowing viewers to connect emotionally while still remaining engaged in the suspense. Themes of morality, loyalty, ambition, and human frailty are explored in ways that feel organic and resonant, giving the series depth beyond its surface-level drama.

In short, ""Doc"" is a television series that excels in nearly every facet-from writing and directing to acting and production design. It's a show that commands your attention, immerses you in its world, and leaves a lasting impression long after the final episode ends. The characters feel real, the narrative is compelling, and the suspense is meticulously crafted. Whether you are a fan of complex dramas, thrillers, or character-driven storytelling, ""Doc"" is a series that demands to be seen. Personally, I plan to rewatch it before the second season airs, not just to refresh my memory but to relive the brilliance, tension, and emotional resonance that make it such a standout series in contemporary television. It's a rare show that both entertains and moves, and it's a remarkable addition to Disney+'s growing catalog of quality content.",figurative
"The best show Manages to balance depth and humor perfectly. Just pure amazing. It is difficult to say much without spoiling anything, so I will keep it brief, but this show is yes, a parody. It makes fun of the typical sequence of events that occur in 99% of fighting shows. But any idea of normality is turned on its head here. Instead of watching a show about some guy who has a great gift building himself up in power, magically acquiring a under dressed girl in the process, this show is about a guy who already is the most powerful, who is bored, and who no one acknowledges. The plot sounds stupid, yes, but it is well executed, and its impressive how such deep meaning was created out of something that was originally meant to be a joke.",literal
"Better than it's predecessor! Better call Saul is one of the shows that your first sceptical about because lawyer stuff sounds boring compared to the high stakes adventures of breaking bad where Saul was just comedic relief, but in this great prequel the characters are better written, it's shot way better and we finally get to see more of a backstory on the Salamancas and how nacho played a major part in the reason of their downfall. Last few episodes look amazing with the nice noir look to it. Really love Kim in this series because she has some really great arcs and falls in love with slippin jimmy (Saul Goodman) and they do more and more schemes together as the series progresses. Love it <3. Best series ever made. BRAVO VINCE!!!!",literal
"Good I liked the show for a while, but eventually the only reason I was watching was because I was attached to a few characters. Then, Perette left. I had been looking for a reason to stop watching for a while and that was the one.",literal
"As good as the first movie... The 2021 movie ""Nobody"" was such an unexpected blast of a movie, and I thoroughly did enjoy it, so of course I needed no persuasion to sit down and watch the 2025 sequel ""Nobody 2"".

Derek Kolstad, who also wrote the first movie, returns to write the sequel alongside with Aaron Rabin, and they really put together a script and storyline that captured the spirit of the first movie and also expanded upon it. I was genuinely entertained throughout the course of the 89 minutes that the movie ran for.

Leading actor Bob Odenkirk really carries the movie phenomenally well, just as he did in the 2021 movie. It was also nice to have Connie Nielsen, Gage Munroe, Paisley Cadorath, Colin Salmon and Christopher Lloyd return to reprise their roles from the first movie. In addition, the movie also brings John Ortiz, Colin Hanks, Daniel Bernhardt and Sharon Stone into the storyline. It was really nice to see Sharon Stone in the movie, and also nice to see Colin Hanks branch out into a role such as this. Needless to say that the acting performances in ""Nobody 2"" are good.

There is a lot of action and fighting in the movie, just as in the previous movie. And it was nicely choreographed and brought to the screen, adding a lot to the overall enjoyment of the movie.

If you enjoyed the 2021 movie ""Nobody"", then you most certainly will also enjoy ""Nobody 2"". This is definitely a movie that I warmly recommend.

My rating of director Timo Tjahjanto's 2025 movie ""Nobody 2"" lands on a well-deserved seven out of ten stars.",literal
"About time It's about time they gave this series more life, they definitely cancelled the wrong Law & Order series. I would have loved to have seen Jeremy Sisto carry on next to Anthony Anderson but I do like Jeffery Donovan.",literal
"Fun, easy binge with interesting but unrealized themes A fun and easy binge, this show isn't really breaking any new ground (despite the culture war accusations). Half cult/mysterybox show, half teen drama, the show explores the troubled teen industry through two arguably codependent relationships: BFFs in danger of failing high school due to truancy and the romance of a troubled cop and an adult graduate of the problem.

It's supposed to be set in 2003, which is easy to forget until someone pulls out a walkman or cell phone. Some of that is because of how chill everyone is about Alex's gender identity; I was momentarily confused when Alex said he his wife weren't legally married because they couldn't. It is a bit hard to buy the Detroit Police hiring a trans man in 2003, but it's not a big focus of the show, and I don't think anyone's picking this genre based on a desire for historical realism.

The finale asks what sort of sacrifices different people are willing to make in exchange for social acceptance, but it's kind of an afterthought. For instance, it's implied that we sacrifice our core values in the process of growing up, but teens are FAMOUSLY susceptible to social pressure even without cult-imposed groupthink.

Ultimately, I think, I would have liked to see the series explore this question a bit more, and not just in the last act. It's a teen story in the ""Holes"" tradition, but Louis Sachar's did a much better job of tying his mystery and social commentary together. I'd give it a 6 or 6.5/10, but the finale bumped it up to a 7 - 7.5. A cut above your average Netflix release, and definitely better acted.",literal

It's all ridiculous but I sat there with a stupid smile on my face the whole time. I thought Alan Ritchson was hilarious.

Not a bad way to waste a couple of hours. Switch the brain off and embrace the ridiculous.",literal
"Please be serious. It's not a bad movie but all these reviews saying how original and unique it is are reaching.

You have seen this movie before.

It's interesting, it has occult elements and it has some good performances from the actors. But it is being severely overhyped.

The plot progression hinges on people making stupid decisions. If the characters acted reasonably, it would have been much shorter.

For me, the scariest movies are ones based on a true story. This movie boldly claims it's based on actual events, but it's really not.

It's like saying Scream was based on a true story because some teenagers got stabbed.

It's not one of those cerebral horror movies that demands a second or third watch. It's not really even a horror movie. At the core, it's a movie about a search for kids with some random horror elements mixed in.

Just to be clear, I'm not saying it's a bad movie. But the claims that it's the best horror movie in years is nonsense. It's not even the best horror movie THIS year.

People in the theater laughed through most of it and the ending was pretty ridiculous.

Watch it if you want, come to your own conclusion, but I saw it once and that was more than enough.

Anybody that rated this over a 7 is either lying or has really low standards.",literal
"You see that? Sick, right? Ah, it's so bad... it's so terribly bad... BUT Alan Ritchson is a comedic powerhouse and Kevin James is decent. Every time that Ritchson opened his mouth, I couldn't stop laughing.

The rest of the movie is painful. There were moments where it looked like the actors were reading cue cars (Sarah Chalke on the couch), the non-improv dialogue is painful and the plot is full of holes.

My main question is ""why?"" Why is Kevin James' character involved at all? I went back to see if I missed something and I didn't. There is absolutely 0 reason why Jeff is recruiting Brian for this ""mission"". They could have at least made him a programmer or someone whose help Jeff needed to get access to a building or something.

Honestly, I laughed my tail off for the majority of the film but the structure and story are so dang lazy.

Best Character: Jeff Best Quote: ""You see that? Sick, right?"" - Jeff Best Scene: The car chase.",literal
Magnificent mystery movie! Genius I would've seen later in the week delighted it was the Monday mystery movie. Might not be as loved as part one but totally epic nonetheless.

"Anthony Michael Hall as a geek? I didn't see that one coming! Most teenage boys probably can't help but relate to Gary (Hall) and Wyatt (Ilan Michell-Smith). They're just average sex starved teens that create a living, breathing, aerobicizing woman with super model looks, the brain of Einstein and the magic of Houdini with Wyatt's home computer. Yeah, I know, it might sound cheesy but it's still fun. There's plenty to see and laugh at, and there is something for everyone. If you're a girl, you'll love seeing the two boys embarrass themselves to no end. If you're a guy, you won't care about dialogue or anything else as long as Lisa (Kelly LeBrock)is on-screen. Although I can't say, I liked it as much as some other John Hughes movies I've seen, it is still great entertainment when your just in the mood to fall into the 80's or have some mindless laughs. If you like teen movies, you'll want to see this one.",literal
Always loved it always will Even as a straight man. I can say that Benson serves as a symbol for strength in women. Having watched the show for 10 years now and seen likely 95%+ of the episodes from her partnership with Elliot (my favorite wish he'd come back) as a young inexperienced detective to a force to be reckoned with. She developed from an actor playing a role. To a social figure 20 years later. No one could've seen this coming,literal
"It was clear from the first EP that it was a disaster, but as we move forward it becomes a massacre of topics treated sufficiently and superficially Whatever dramatic topic this series deals with ruins it because it deals with it with little conviction and in an approximate way, and this causes me a lot of sadness because the dramatic topics covered in this TV series are many but unfortunately they are all very badly written, the worst of all and the ending, now I'm not here to say whether it ends well or badly because clearly a series must be judged regardless of an ending with a happy ending or an ending without a happy ending, having said this the problem is that the ending is a nice mockery a bit like those films or series of the years 70 where you saw a car fall into a ravine and the protagonist together with the car but in the following episode you saw the protagonist open the door and throw himself from the car before falling off the cliff and this brings us back to the fact that the topics are treated superficially and without commitment. This thing can also be seen in the actors. Many seem unconvinced of what they are doing. Going back to the ending, the same ending could have been done but in a serious way without stupid games and without approximate dialogues and, and in any case many things are designed for a second season which will ever see the light!",literal
"paycheck project Holy cow! This is more abysmal than i thought would be. None of the actors give good performance. The plot is pathetic. No twists, surprise, addition of a 'family' as if we should care about a bunch of no-name actors with nothing to add to the plot. Hard to believe this is written by David koepp, a master in his own craft. The first flop of this franchise. Universal deserves every piece of criticism it is getting. Horrendous CGI is an added disaster for this slop. I had high expectations after the previous two garbage entries in this franchise but i never felt any excitement in the trailer so naturally the movie is even pathetic i thought it would be.",literal
"Season 21 awful Terrible writing! Terrible casting! Hugh Dancy is just plain awful in his role. In episode 5, his witness ""hangs himself"" while in custody, and when he's told he shakes his head up and down while having a dumb look on his face! That's just one of many horrible pieces of acting!

The stories are poorly written, and the character played by Jeff Donovan is just unlikable, and I'm a big fan of his and his starring role in Burn Notice.

She is the main villian of the show and somehow the main character. But even without her, I don't see the point of the show. I gave it a lot of chances since its Vince but whats the draw? I don't see any conclusion to be satisfying except for killing Carol and its a happy ending.",literal
"some more ideas I guess It's hard to get the very last episode of any show completely right without thinking of more ideas or missed opportunities, there is always going to be room for improvement no matter how they end it. Yes, the toothbrush idea would have been nice, but I think it would have been lovely perhaps to have seen when Cathy opens the door at the end Dr. Sherman be the first person she sees standing there say the words ""Hello, my dear"", then reach out his hand to lead her into the afterlife, especially with his last words he said to her being ""I'll see you again soon"", when she had a visit from him in her ward after he passed away. Once there, we should have seen the all the characters on the show who have passed on be in one room all together to greet her including the guardian Angel she kept seeing, Marlene, Leigh, Joy and Thomas the dog...and perhaps even baby Cathy.",literal
"Göring, Kelley, and the Dangerous Cost of Empathy Nuremberg is one of those films that reminds you just how powerful great casting can be. With performances from Rami Malek, Russell Crowe, John Slattery, Leo Woodall, and a handful of other strong supporting names, the movie feels stacked from the moment it opens. And despite its nearly three-hour runtime, it never drags. Instead, it holds you in this tense, intellectual grip from start to finish.

Russell Crowe delivers one of his most unsettling performances in years as Hermann Göring. He captures the charisma, the self-importance, and the chilling delusion that defined the man-making him both fascinating and repulsive at the same time. Rami Malek matches him beat for beat as Dr. Kelley, the psychiatrist who enters the prison confident and cocky, only to slowly unravel as he comes face-to-face with a type of narcissism and manipulation he's clearly not prepared for. Their dynamic is the backbone of the film, and it plays almost like a subtle psychological thriller rather than a traditional historical drama.

One of the film's biggest strengths is the way it forces the viewer to wrestle with an uncomfortable idea: do evil men retain a human side, or do ordinary humans all carry a capacity for evil? The script doesn't preach either message directly, but it places you right in the tension of those questions. It humanizes Göring just long enough to make you uneasy-right before reminding you in disturbing detail exactly what he was responsible for. That emotional whiplash seems entirely intentional, and it lingers.

The movie also shines a light on a part of World War II history that isn't taught in depth in most American classrooms: the Nuremberg trials themselves. It brings the legal, ethical, and psychological stakes into sharp focus. At the same time, the film isn't shy about drawing modern parallels, reminding us how easily societies can be swayed by narcissistic leaders and how devastating it can be to underestimate them-something Dr. Kelley learns the hard way.

All that said, Nuremberg still lives in a category with an enormous number of World War II films. And while it's well-acted, engaging, and absolutely worth watching, it doesn't quite reach the heights of the very best entries in the genre. It's a strong film-not a masterpiece.

Final rating: 7/10. A compelling, uncomfortable, and well-performed historical drama that earns your time, even if it doesn't fully set itself apart.",figurative
"Move over NCIS This new series is off to a great start. The story lines are exciting and there's never a boring moment. With each episode, we learn more about our main characters. Great acting! I believe it will give NCIS a run for its money.",literal
"A triumph of American television I've grown up with the original Shameless. It's a fast paced Comedy-Drama like no other, in that it lends itself perfectly to both without apology or hesitation.

Whereas the British original finds it's characters living, fornicating, screaming and jumping in the revelry of zero-expectation in a rigid class system, the American remake masterfully equivocates the triumphs and the tribulations of a lower class family existing on the edge of acceptability at the heart of society in a flawless, delicate and shameless manner.

The pilot introduces the characters, much like their British counterparts, not in an effort to garner their sympathy but simply as a statement of fact. The aspiring teen marine struggling to hide his homosexuality only fears losing the love of his brother, the absent drunk dad who loves his children but through the haze becomes a heckling prophet - a Shakespearean fool who sees through the thin veil of sanity and order, a young woman struggling to keep the family together seeing a way out through a handsome highwayman. These people are not bad even if they do bad things. Society has forgot about them and for that they couldn't care less for it.

The whole cast is tremendous but William H. Macy rises to the occasion with the father, a Frank Gallagher straight out of a bar in Memphis at 3 a.m. on a Wednesday, last orders, don't interrupt him because he hasn't finished yet, he's got to tell you what's wrong with the world before he wakes up and it all ends. You would believe this guy was a war vet or something with the confidence and delirium at which he pontificates.

No matter what your race or background you can take something away from Shameless. Most television that likes to call itself Comedy, Drama, or both, tends towards a particular demographic, offering an escape fantasy for, say, the 'off-beat' teens in Glee or the sexually deviant young adults in True Blood or the repressed housewives in that show about the repressed housewives.

As the designated guardian's new boyfriend takes a seat at the head of the table, he pushes Frank's legs aside as he crashes drunk on the floor. Shameless doesn't escape anything, it lives in the world it is given and every so often reminds you, during those joyously chaotic scenes, that the sweetest lemonade is almost bitter, so it's just as well every episode is only an hour for you to laugh, cry and enjoy.

Moments of anarchic jubilation inter lap, run over and sometimes juxtapose flourishes of near-the-bone reality, served eloquently on a fresh platter to which America needs to to have the stomach for.",literal
"[9.2] The cut off thumb disguised as chicken meat A horrifying tale of madness, arguably half-bad genes, mind shaking disgusting experimental lobotomy with acid infusion in and out, brilliantly told, depicted, played and acted.

The unfolding of events near superbly depicted, the protagonists and antagonists devilishly and marvelously doing their respective acting job, the cream of them being Evan Peter's mindless acting, embodying the twisted serial killer with ease and dark charisma.

The story and depiction of events are superbly told, a little light though on gruesome scenes all the while piercing your olfactory sense with horrifyingly masterful effects, literally ""sensing"" together with the neighbor next door, the feel and odor of decaying flesh laced with debilitating acidic vapors.

It's a tale of madness that hopefully would never happen again with also hopefully, law enforcement forces doing their job way more correctly in all aspects, ""awarded"" when it's rightly due.

The storyline makes no sense at all as it has no framework to hang the plot on that you expect in well-written, structured fantasies.

"Good one, but... A decade after and this show can still offer a quite fun time watching. Once you get used to the type of humour, you watch it very easily. 10-2 rating because of the Robert California role (terrible casting choice) who destroyed one whole season. I really couldn't stand watching the scenes with him. He was so out of the series vibe, so bad influence for the continuity of the plot. And second reason was Andy's unfortunate effort to copy Michael character (serious lack of inspiration from the directors). The producers should have stopped the series when Michael left the building, it would be so much better.",literal
"A moody, nostalgic, and supernatural mystery that just needs a little technical cleanup. Shelby Oaks may not be perfect, but it's haunting and absolutely worth seeing. As someone who's followed Chris Stuckmann's YouTube reviews for years, seeing Shelby Oaks hit theaters was a surreal moment. The question on every fan's mind was simple: could he pull a ""Danny and Michael Philippou"" and make the successful leap from film critic to filmmaker?

The answer-mostly yes. Shelby Oaks is an intriguing, eerie, and emotionally grounded debut that shows real promise, even if it occasionally stumbles on execution.

The film opens like a crime mockumentary, establishing a grounded tone similar to true-crime docs before shifting into full-blown supernatural mystery. The setup revolves around the disappearance of the Paranormal Paranoids, a YouTube ghost-hunting team led by Riley (Sarah Durn). Her sister Mia (Camille Sullivan) becomes obsessed with uncovering the truth after a mysterious man appears at her door with a videotape that may hold the key to what really happened. It's a strong hook-and one that keeps you invested from the start.

Stuckmann and his wife, Samantha Elizabeth, crafted a story that feels like a love letter to both classic horror and the digital-age fascination with found footage. Shelby Oaks carries the DNA of '60s supernatural horror-films like The Omen but filters it through a modern, YouTube-era lens. It's a restrained, slow-burn approach that lets the tension simmer before paying it off with real dread.

Where Shelby Oaks falters is in its visuals. A few scenes... likely CGI or AI-generated, stick out like a sore thumb. They don't mesh with the otherwise grounded, documentary-like style. It's understandable given the film's indie roots and Kickstarter origins, but these moments pull you right out of the atmosphere Stuckmann works so hard to build. It's the kind of issue that could easily be fixed with a small post-production polish, especially now after the films opening.

Despite those hiccups, Shelby Oaks succeeds in what it sets out to do: tell a creepy, emotionally resonant story about loss, belief, and the dangers of chasing ghosts-literal and figurative. It's a strong first effort from Stuckmann, proof that his passion for the genre runs deeper than critique.",literal
"Enjoyable show but lazy writing The show isn't bad. It's certainly entertaining and has a lot of humor in it. The actors are great as well. I didn't see many miscast in the whole show (except for the returning of Meg which was terrible) 

So, what's the problem ?

The writing is very lazy, not only in a way that makes the show very predictable, but they also rip off other great shows like the X-Files by copying out either entire episodes or scenes. In the season 11 for instance, the telekinetic baby is a whole scene ripped off from William's episode of X-Files.

The worst thing about the show is clearly the plot. It is ALWAYS the same : One brother dies / gets tormented by a terrible curse / has to endure an ordeal. The other brother tries to save him at all costs and against the will of his brother, often by unleashing a worst evil leading to the next season. Note that there's often a ""superweapon"" involved that's needed to kill a ""supervilain"" which conveniently falls out of fashion next season even though it's ""all powerful"".

Some things also don't make any sense. At the beginning of the show, they were all trying to save people and got really afflicted with each innocent's death. For instance, they would always carefully exorcise demons to try to save it's host. But, after some point, they stopped doing that out of nowhere and started blasting demons with a ceremonial knife and thus killing it's host. Worst thing about this is they felt no remorse, and the writers didn't bother to explain the psychological event that lead to this drastic change of mindset.",figurative
"Worthy sequel I just got back from seeing it at the theaters

The movie, overall, matches the original, which is a big accomplishment for a sequel: the original will always have the distinction of being the first, and with this particular premise, a huge hindrance is that he can't really be a Nobody twice. Part 1 could build up the moment where the audience and supporting characters find out who he is, but the franchise can't replicate that plot device in sequels. By Part 2, he's a Somebody.

Still, though, the movie surpasses the original in 2 areas. Firstly, I think that the comedy in Part 2 surpasses the comedy in Part 1. There were numerous instances in Part 2 that legitimately had me laughing, and I'm not easy to please on comedy (e.g. I found the 2025 Naked Gun movie to be unfunny). To say what parts had me laughing might ruin those parts, so I won't say. Secondly, I think that Sharon Stone makes a better, more memorable antagonist than the Russian guy in Part 1.

The movie's other positives are basically the same positives that apply to Part 1. Bob Odenkirk is a likable and charming protagonist. Though his role as Saul Goodman is iconic, you don't actually see Saul Goodman when you watch him in this movie; he occupies this role entirely. The movie blends the slick, intense action scenes with hilarious comedy in a way that neither clashes with the other or creates awkwardness. The compact 90-minute runtime is perfect. And I like Christopher Lloyd. We don't know how many more big-screen movies he'll appear in, so we should cherish them

In terms of flaws - the movie has a predictable plot; nothing here is really original or creative. And I don't imagine that many people, after watching, will remember this movie in the long-run. The movie builds up Sharon Stone's character, yet the protagonists take her out relatively easily. There are some cliches. There are some elements recycled from the first film

I gave the original a 6.5/10. I'll give this one the same score

6.5/10.",literal

"It's fun, but has nothing to do with the Adam's Family Who is this show really for? Smells like young adult content, but they did not grow up with the original cartoon or the live action movie.

But then again.. the show is not really about the Adam's family or what makes them fun, because we focus on a ""who done it/murder mystery"".

The Adam's should if true to the original story love/dislike the opposite of us and that is the core of what makes them special. So basically Wednesday should love all the murders and not try and solve the mystery.. since when did she become a detective? Her father should love the idea of prison and the pain it brings.

Why not just make an original script with similar setting with a girl solving the same mystery? Oh right.. because Netflix.",literal
"""Strong Cast, Weak Movie"" This film felt like waiting for a bus that never quite commits to arriving. The pacing crawled along so slowly that by the time the actual story peeked out, I'd already checked the clock more than the screen. The plot itself never paid off; it wandered without purpose and left me wondering what the point was supposed to be.

The soundtrack didn't help. Instead of lifting the scenes, it dragged them down with tones that felt mismatched and distracting, like background noise fighting to be noticed for all the wrong reasons.

The one bright spot was the acting. The cast did everything they could to breathe life into the script, delivering performances that deserved a far better story to stand on.

Overall, great acting trapped inside a slow, uneventful, and poorly told narrative. Not a movie I'd sit through again.",literal
"A Refreshing New Show! Edie is excellent! ""ER"" with humor Edie Falco, best known for her role as Carmela Soprano on HBO's ""The Sopranos"" amazes viewers with her talent and versatility. ""Nurse Jackie"" is hilarious, dramatic, sensitive, touching, and feels very real. As someone who has spent time working in an ER, the nuances and interactions between the characters have me asking who wrote this, because this weird random stuff has totally happened. 

You have to have a good sense of humor to enjoy it. It may be a little bit of dark comedy. I highly highly recommend it if you are a fan of ""The Sopranos"", ""Six Feet Under"" , ""Nip/Tuck"", ""Rescue Me"",or ""Dead Like Me"" then you will definitely love the show. Edie Falco is fantastic. I have re-watched every single episode. You may not like the first episode, so I'd urge you to watch the first two. I guarantee you'll be hooked.",figurative
"Highly enjoyed I went in with no expectations or any knowledge of the film just wanting to see something different. That's what I got different and enjoyed the whole movie from the music to the visuals to just acting and made me remember what seeing a movie is like again that's not action, horror, or cgi. It's been awhile since I have seen a movie that has made me cry and feel something and I respect the work they did for this film. I will now have to read the book cause I found out it was based off a book and in the past movies have always been ruined to me by reading them first. I would recommend seeing this and go in with and open mind and heart and see it to see it.",literal
"Some cultural mistakes, good nevertheless I've watched two episodes, and will at least hang in there for a couple more. The acting is adequate, and the story line doesn't drag. I struggled with managing all the sub plots and the many characters-at times I felt I needed a diagram to keep them all straight. A few times all this complicated storytelling was unnecessary.

Two cultural mistakes: episode 2 showed a Plains teepee being used as a Navajo dwelling. I wish this old tired stereotype would die, because it implies a generalization to all indigenous peoples. Navajo rituals would take place in a six sided mud roofed hogan, their traditional dwelling. I'm surprised the accuracy folks working on the show didn't veto this right away.

Second, Navajo people don't typically keep chickens. The coyotes would eat them up every night, and without water-most rural Navajos don't have plumbing-using water to raise chickens would be wasteful.

I've lived in northern Arizona much of my life , have Navajo friends and spent a lot of time in the Navajo nation. So yes, I know of what I speak here.

Hopefully these cultural stereotypes and outright mistakes will disappear in later episodes. It's ruining the show's credibility for me.",literal
"All bark no bite. If you like strong and logical plots, you are likely to dislike this one. It's all about appearances and show in this one, rather than actually being brilliant, the characters and story just ask you take their brilliance for granted. 

The story revolves around illusionists (implicitly portrayed as demigods I would say) and how they manage to fool everyone and get a little fooled themselves. Of course, with all this fooling around there are always chances that something might strike the funny bone, that is to say it has its humorous moments now and then but on the whole the illusions and tricks etc. is just more of a dazzle than something logical and realistic. There is not much depth to the characters and a lot of misdirection to make the climax more effective, but the misdirection only adds to the illogical nature of the plot and makes the story hollow.

Having criticized enough the good parts for me were the cocky-as-usual Jesse Eisenberg and some of the funny moments but nothing else. Even the dazzle of the magic tricks was made slow and plain by all the simple filler like dialogues. Final word; skip it unless you don't have a better choice for a movie in mind.",literal
"The Cast and Crew Led by Jenna Ortega Elevate Wednesday Beyond The Usual Genre Trappings The biggest reason I was hesitant to watch Wednesday was because of what it was advertised as. It's pretty hard to do a respectable job with a young adult property let alone produce a good one. There's been so many attempts, anything geared towards teenagers is almost forced to parody itself just to dodge people overtly giggling and smirking at it. Wednesday doesn't avoid all the pitfalls but I was pleasantly surprised that it navigated its way around as many of them as they did. The central mystery was interesting enough that I didn't know outright guess it halfway through and although I'm not the biggest Tim Burton fan (I like some of his work, other projects... not so much) his experienced hand and Gothic sensibilities are perfect for this budding franchise. Despite the occasional misstep, I was impressed at how the show kept up the pace and didn't become too rote after each adventure with Wednesday. The creative team may not have created the new Citizen Kane but there was effort put into the story here and I appreciated that.

Instead of the whole Addams Family being at the forefront, we focus on the titular Wednesday as the protagonist and there's a lot of work put into understanding her mindset at this point in her life. She's a sullen and angry teenager but she's also got a razor sharp wit and a passion for seeking out the truth in her surroundings. I do think they sanded off a couple of the sharper edges from previous versions of the character (the jokes she tells are similar but she's less edgy in her interactions with others), but it was a necessary sacrifice as she needs to at least be semi-approachable by her classmates and other members of the Nevermore community. As much as her rebellious streak could have been annoying or cliche, the writers frame it as her wanting to step out of Morticia and Gomez's shadows and forge her own identity. She's still suitably prickly, but much like the Grinch, her heart grows a couple of sizes by the end of the initial season. Some of the supporting characters are given some nice mini-arcs like learning to stand up for yourself (Eugene), learning to accept yourself for who you are and live your best life (Enid) and even to let go of bias and preconceived notions and moving forward with an open mind (Sheriff Galpin and Principal Weems). Is it all stuff we've seen before? Perhaps, but it gives the background players some material to chew on while Wednesday skulks around Jericho.

I wasn't thrilled with much of the casting, I grew up watching Raul Gulia, Anjelica Huston and Christina Ricci as the Addams Family but once again, Wednesday left me taken aback. I was swayed by Jenna Ortega's fascinating work as Wednesday. I wasn't familiar with her before this but if she's not a star already, this should catapult her to the next level. She gets Wednesday's biting humour and she even brings some physicality to her performance. She's excellent at being stone-faced and motionless while she's interrogating suspects or making biting criticisms of her peers. Gwendoline Christie does a gratifying job of playing against type as Principal Weems, she's a figurehead who's all smiles in front of the cameras but an imposing figure behind the scenes. Gwendoline does a solid job of portraying her duplicitous nature. Christina Ricci (famous for previously playing Wednesday Adams) is a nice bit of casting as Marilyn Thornhill. She's very sweet and convincing as a sympathetic ear to Wednesday and it was fun to see her again in this property. Luis Guzman and Catherine Zeta Jones grew on me as Gomez and Morticia. Zeta-Jones was the standout of the 2 but they both got the strange beat that Gomez and Morticia dance to together as they fawn over each other in every single moment. I'd also like to credit Emma Myers, Hunter Doohan and Joy Sunday respectively for their work as Enid, Tyler and Bianca. All 3 of them had some standout moments and were good in their supporting roles.

While Wednesday is certainly intriguing and is raised above the normal fair by its excellent lead performance, the material itself is cribbed from a lot of other YA properties. It's faithful to the Addams Family spirit but the teenage private eye angle, the school for outcasts, the separate social clubs/houses are all either borrowed from previous series like Riverdale or successful movie properties like Harry Potter. Any effort in the genre is going to have similarities but even when explaining parts of the show to my family, their comments were ""okay, so just like __________?"" The only retort I could offer is that while it does ""borrow"" many bits and pieces, Wednesday does it well enough that you can almost forget/forgive them for it. But I have watched my fair share of YA material and these thoughts were still present in my mind as I binge watched every episode.

I got a lot more out of Wednesday than I expected to and I'm happy to applaud it for that. I'm not in the target audience but due to the efforts of Ortega and the cast, the great Gothic atmosphere, an adequate central mystery and some chuckle worthy jokes, I was happy I took the time despite my reservations. Wednesday may not be wholly original but it's still an upper tier entry in a genre that's best days are long since past. I'd be happy to watch a 2nd season for sure. Wednesday is plenty creepy, kooky, mysterious and spooky enough to justify your time on Netflix.",literal
"Rare, Medium or Welldone A strong proof that the scariest horror isn't based on monsters, demons or desasters, but on the simple reality we have created to convince us that the world would be safer. The opposite is the case.

The world we're living in and depend on has reached a point, where the chance of bombing us back into the Stone Age is likely possible to happen. Due to technical failure or human error. That's an undeniable fact. Denying this evidence might make you feel more comfortable or serve a special political agenda, but thinking of the unpredictable morons who are actually politically in charge of the process right now doesn't make it any better.

A majority seems to feel frustrated or upset about the ending, which doesn't satisfy their expectations. They simply don't seem to realize that Kathryn Bigelow's intention wasn't to create a conventional thriller like many other's. Instead she delivers an even more frightening urgent warning about what could happen any time. Only mentally deranged people could wish a more satisfying ending by watching the nuclear incineration of a major capital in full graphic details. She refuses that kind of finale for good reasons, because the real horror is based on your own imagination. In case you have one.

A masterpiece in raising tension, keeping you on the edge of your seat throughout, based on strong realism and supported by a very convincing cast of actors.",figurative
"An ultimately unsatisfying thriller Absentia is not a 1/10. It's also not a 10/10. I gave it a 6 for creating genuine tension even amidst the bad writing and incoherent plot features. The series tells the tale of a former FBI agent on the run from false accusations after being held captive and declared dead for 6 years. Clear My Name (see TV Tropes for an explanation) has always been a fraught theme for me. I often find these plots maddening and unsatisfying as they create unnecessary stupidity in the ancillary characters in order to work. Absentia was no exception. This series employed every bad cliche of the Clear My Name genre. From absurd contrivances to illogical decision making, the characters in this series bumble their way to an ending as predictable as the sunrise. She Clears Her Name. You don't necessarily need to avoid this series, but don't clear your schedule and settle in with the popcorn either.",literal

A lot of the scenes were ones we have already seen (if you are following the creator) but now they have added in context!

"A good story, bad ending The premise was very interesting and the twist on the romcom. However, I would not describe this as a romcom, it lacked the romance and the comedy was also suffering due to Dakota Johnoson's delivery. The main issue of the film was casting Johnson as the lead. Her acting was mediocre at best and her character lacked depth.

I think for the love story part, John, the guy Lucy ends up with should have had better chemistry. I was so sure in the end Lucy would choose herself/choose neither option. It was clear Pedro Pascal's character was never a serious love interest option. Nevertheless, Lucy shouldn't have ended up with John either as John hadn't managed to ""fix"" any of the problems they had 5 years ago. I think it was not unreasonable for Lucy to want her 40-year old partner to have his life somewhat together and not live with roommates and a non-existant salary.

I'll give this a 7/10 still as this film has made me reflect on the issues on modern dating culture and preferences. I just wish the end would have been different. Her ending up with an ex just felt like a let down. However, I did enjoy the start and middle parts a lot and the questions raised througout was very engaging.",literal
"Season 2 brought it home. -Finished season 2.

While season 1 very much was about character introduction, world introduction and set the ""atmosphere"" of the witcher - It didn't do all that great in producing a coherent and progressive plot. Season 2 changed this in every major way.

Season 2 of The Witcher is almost completely shown in chronological order of events, and it focuses a lot on plot and character progression. The season still retains a couple of its ""witcher-esque"" random encounters that can almost be summarized as quests from the game Witcher 3.

The main character of this season is undoubtedly Ciri, but whereas in the first season we only got to learn that ""she is special"", in season 2 we, she and everyone relevant in the plot learns just why she is special, and her tangled destiny truly starts to show itself.

The ending to the season provided a burning thirst for a 3rd season, as there are a lot of freshly opened plotlines to dive into where it left off.

All around I can't find much wrong with this season perhaps except for there being a little too little Jaskier nonsense.

"Romeo and Juliet Meet Scarface A war breaks out between two sides of a drug cartel family after the fiancé of a peace-seeking member is murdered by the other side.

This thriller tragedy starts slow and ends with a bang. The story is a cross between Romeo and Juliet and Scarface, which is self-explanatory. There is some action, but it's the thrills, suspense, and twists that make the movie truly captivating. The one hour and fifty-two-minute runtime is longer than necessary to tell this story, resulting in parts that are slow-paced.

The show is (as far as I know) realistic, compared to many other mafia shows and movies I have seen. The actors fit like a glove to their parts. This show made me realize how good many of these actors are in other shows and movies. This show has it all; humor, action, drama, good music, good actors, good ""behind the camera"" people and a good plot.

I felt it was promising for the first 30 minutes, mostly due to wonderfully brutal cinematography. However, as soon as the drama ramped up, actors started to overact and the whole script all of a sudden derailed into Hollywood cliche land.

First season was good but for some reason you were so arrogant you thought your ideas were better so you destroyed something people love. Worse you replaced it with Cliche and nonsensical, lazy drivel.

Acting, cinematography, props, set all great and Henry cavil embodies Geralt in a way only a true fan can fully appreciate. The show is just spoiled by poor writing choices. I really hope the back lash from the terrible 3rd season will cause netfilx to make some changes in upcoming seasons but I'm not optimistic.",literal
"Let's trade places shall we?! Was good fortune supposed to be funny even with Seth Rogen, Aziz Ansari or even Keanu Reeves?

The Theme of Rich Guy trying to see the Poor side of life was evident here with many lessons. People say it's funny but u didn't find it funny. Was looking forward to the end of the movie. A boring pop corn on a Sunday watch type movie. Funny? Ha! I didn't laugh once.",literal
"Love it OK so the movie was absolute class. Sheer genius in every sense. But the thing is it was never going to reach the mass market.

This show is both fun, dark and exiting. Yes the material is very similar to the original movie, but it's not trying to be something different. The masses won't watch the original movie because it's Australian and too heavy. Haters are gonna hate, but I would urge them to remember that very little material is original out there. Nowadays almost everything is an adaptation. This the perfect adaptation for the mass market who simply don't want to sit through one heavy, dark as hell feature, they want a recurring show, they want to get to know the characters. If this does its job properly it will have viewers turning to the feature film in between the first and second season... 

As you can tell I loved this adaptation as much as i loved the original feature, almost more because it was fun. I want fun. I want well executed television and I felt that I was given just that.

I advise you try it out for yourself. You're either gonna switch off or turn back on so what's the worst that can happen!?",literal
Good start Good start to the American version of a great 2 year old British series. I'm glad to see Rose McIver on tv again after watching her in iZombie for so long. Hopefully they don't ruin this show as is so often done when remaking British or other shows.,literal
Horrible acting Ellen Barkin is atrocious in this . As I watched her last night with the controlled walk and nose in the air it just didn't ring as being at all believable . Her scenes with sons and closeups where she tries to pull off the I know what you've been up to just don't make it - She should take that little bounce out of her step.,literal
"A Nightmare on Elm Street meets Sinister First of all, I have to admit I'm a huge fan of the first movie and when they announced that they're making a sequel, I was super excited about it. So, I went to the cinema to watch it and I have to say, it was a great cinematic experience and I enjoyed it, so much. The movie synopsis was very interesting and it was kinda different than the previous movie. The storyline was very well-written, well-explained and every question we had in the first movie, it was answered in the sequel. The main two characters (Finney and Gwen) were still very interesting, likeable and we had the chance to get to know them better. However, I have to say that Gwen was the highlight of the movie. The casting choices were mostly the same as before and their performances were excellent. By the way, Madeleine's acting was PHENOMENAL and I had no idea that she was such a great actresses. The filming location of the movie was a winter youth camp in the snowy mountains which was a great location for a horror movie to be filmed. Gladly, the sequel was more intense than before and it was more action-filled, I mean there were some great mini chase scenes during the movie. Also, I would consider it a very scary movie, since it was creepier and there were more jumpscares than before. Moreover, I have to say it was a very bloody movie, gory and this time, there were more onscreen kills. Furthermore, I need to say that the cinematography of the movie was BEAUTIFUL and the score of the movie gave me chills, not joking. Another thing I noticed is that the visions of the dead kids in the sequel had a longer duration and they were absolutely terrifying. Last but least, the 3rd act was extremely suspenseful, shocking AF, very gory and it was just PERFECT. By the way, the Grabber was more BRUTAL than ever. Overall, ""Black Phone 2"" was a great horror sequel, kinda emotionally intense sometimes (especially, the last scene), very bloody, with some great mini chase scenes, visually beautiful and I would definitely recommend it to anyone!",literal
"It's whoever's fault this was made Cannot believe this has the rating it does. This felt like the longest, most poorly written, phoned in acting and loosely directed Lifetime movie ever. It was never ending. Dakota couldn't stop shaking her head, Sarah's hands did the acting for her and everyone else seemed to be ""feeling"" or ""emoting"" an expression that didn't match the scene... Don't waste your time, it's absurd. Like absurd!",literal
"Excellent in every respect Everything about this series is topflight - the writing, the acting, the cinematography, the set decoration.

Having read the books, I can say with certainty that each actor understands his/her character and portrays him/her with depth and sensitivity. Aidan Turner IS Ross Poldark, and both his loves, Demelza and Elizabeth are equally well enacted.

The supporting roles are also enacted with sensitivity and flair.

Filmed on location in Cornwall, even the scenery contributes to the overall production values.

If you like quality productions don't miss this one.It is well worth watching,and I look forward to future episodes.",literal
"Lower star ratings for Season 21 drop the overall rating I am a huge original Law & Order fan. I often watch repeats from the first 20 years. The new season suffers from unconvincing acting (perhaps except for Anthony Anderson), forced story lines, and poor scripts. I hope they will abandon the scripts based on the current big name headlines.",literal
"A movie made by rich people who tell you to just accept the current corrupt system This movie actually does a good job at showing an example of how those not born into privilege are suffering and being taken advantage of while they struggle to avoid homelessness. Sadly, it then tells us to just accept it and portrays the wealthy parties who are abusing the under privileged as good people who simply don't realize they're causing these problems. Then it completely throws 99% of us under the buss by just telling us to accept it and move on.

Seth Rogen and friends cash in on the suffering of others and in the end betray us by telling us to accept that people like him should just simply be allowed to keep on gifting us and that ""karma"" will sort it all out... so don't take any action and keep working and falling behind.

This movie had mild comedy and I didn't find myself laughing the same way as I have at Rogen's other movies. I was expecting more but it seems like Rogen has completely lost touch with his non wealthy fan base.

A movie that generates hope by pointing at the problem, then let's us down with an unrealistic and unpalatable ending. While Rogen spends the money he made off this movie, thousands more of us will become homeless, and that's ok with him. Am I surprised?... no. He's a man who's known nothing but privilege.",literal
"Gave up at episode five Given up on this at episode five. This starts as a pretty average but diverting action drama concerning the downing of a plane load of prisoners. Sadly, it begins to lose its way once ridiculous plot developments occur that spin things into an overblown story of intrigue. At this point the story loses any sense of human scale and so there's no reason to care. Oh, and the sub-plot about the imperilled son and girlfriend is just laughably bad: why would anyone do what they do if their lives were in danger? Clarke tends to be good in most things but he loses his way here.",literal
"This isn't the greatest show on television I'm from the North Jersey area, so a lot of the fun of the Sopranoes is relating it to the things I see and do in my daily life, though despite this, I didn't really have HBO and never really watched the Sopranoes, when it had premiered on television. Except with the 6 season, I saw the whole show on DVD. It was not the first television show I experienced through DVD, and if you've done that before, very well, you could know how incredible it is, and I have to say that while I greatly enjoyed a lot of what the Sopranoes had to offer, in the end, I was disappointed by how the show had been done and what direction it moved to. Judging the show as a whole, what made the show great was practically absent come parts of season 4, and the over-arching brilliance wasn't there anymore with the third season. 

The Positive Aspects: 

-The 1st, 2nd, and parts of the 3rd seasons are as great as any domestic/mob drama worthy of the praise its been getting. The characters are sublime and the themes and story lines are great art as well as television at top-notch. -The acting of the main characters is exquisite and enormously realized with AJ, the son, being the only exception. -Even, when it's off, it's still compelling 

The Negative Aspects: -The show tapers after the 2nd season into weaker story lines and uneven characterization and ceases to make its over-arching thematic points effectively, every season already being progressively worse from the get-go now entering into the territory of non-great television. - The seasons are short, and the cast is huge, making a lot of plot-threads and maybe more than half the cast that deserves better set-up and/or development seem rushed, both under and overplayed, or too easily disposed of, at times egregiously, the tolerability of this coinciding with the show's decline. -The acting of the minor characters is very inconsistent, leaning more of the time in the worse direction, much more than what you could find on certain shows off paycable. 

The finale, which is greatly talked of, really doesn't matter, because the show thematically shot itself in the foot even before its halfway point. Each season got progressively worse starting with the first one. The second one was still incredible, and if the show ended at the end of the second season it could have gone down as the amazing show it should be. Instead we get a mess of a television program that wants to say something but cluttered itself way to much to. Check the show out because it contains certain aspects so touching and so grand that they shall stay with you, being profoundly artistic and exceedingly relevant to modern society, television at its pinnacle of art/entertainment. But if it starts running out of gas, that's when you should stop watching, because it'll never get it back.",literal
"Wasn't sure - glad I gave it a chance Hard to get used to different casting, and I wasn't sure I liked the way it started. But now I'm really enjoying it. It has a unique flavor that I like - not sure how to describe it. Don't want to give spoilers, but after several episodes, it seems to be getting past the initial premise and is becoming the type of show we all know and love. Curious to see how it settles in. Hard to imagine Gibbs becoming the womanizer he was at the start of the original show. I hope people will give it a chance.

It has the usual quirky type of characters, but now we're starting to get to know more about them. I just wish they wouldn't randomly skip weeks, like they're doing with the other shows too.",literal
"Do you like black phones? I love 'em. 'Black Phone 2 (2025)' follows in the footsteps of the 'Friday The 13th' franchise by resurrecting its predecessor's antagonist as a supernatural entity. Essentially transforming Michael Myers into Freddy Krueger, the flick puts Ethan Hawke's Grabber in the enigmatic otherworld of prophetic nightmares and sees him torment his killer's sister while she sleeps. Expanding on an interesting aspect of the first film, the picture spends a lot of time inside the dreams of one of its young heroes, and these moments are easily its most compelling. Shot in wonderfully tactile Super 8 and edited so that memories literally feel like home movies, these sequences blur the line between nightmare and reality and take advantage of the nebulous rules of dream logic to incorporate some truly startling and gruesome imagery into an otherwise grounded world. Unfortunately, there simply isn't as much dream-based horror as I would have liked, and the affair feels like it cuts itself short right when it's at its most exciting. Its relatively low body count also notably dampens its stakes, making its menacing antagonist less deadly than he ought to be and the heroes' potential victory slightly less hard-won than it ideally would be. Still, the set-pieces are arresting - and often surprisingly grisly - and they're used to punctuate a narrative that's far more emotionally resonant than it has any right to be. The denouement almost brought me to tears, and much of the script hits that overly sincere yet earnestly moving note most readily associated - at least for me - with Mike Flanagan's adaptations of Stephen King's work. It isn't quite as compelling as the first film, but it's a very different beast. When it's fully underway, it's an absolute blast. Even its least successful segments are still eminently watchable, and their often derivative nature doesn't impact how fulfilling they are when considered as part of a wider experience. It's a snowy, atmospheric descent into trauma-ridden nightmares with themes of facing your fears and fighting back against your oppressors. It isn't perfect, but it's genuinely entertaining and it's often suitably spooky. It feels fairly distinct as far as modern horror sequels go, too. I'd watch a hundred more of these, I think.",literal
"As real as a parady When life has gone crazy, then the parady of life becomes life itself and the insanity of extremists is the new standard of normality. The question I asked as I was watching this is ""Am I watching a parady or am I watching a fragment of our present reality?"" since what is presented can be seen as borrowed imaginary from our current contention from the repatriation of illegal immigrants, these are as real as reflections coming back from a broken mirror, but also like those reflections, real as they may be coming back at us from individual shards of broken glass, they cannot and are not picture of the entire truth nor the whole story. So if anyone think this is reality, that claim is lacking. However, the larger context of using violence to resolve differences or the unforgiving ""me"" concept of holding exclusive rights to ""righteousness"" is very real for anyone who is hell bend on being infallible. Fortunately, there are moments of black comedic relief that ask us as audience to chill. Lastly, as far as film aesthetic is concern, I love the film score and Jean Penn. Jean's rendition of his character had taken it up to the very edge of caricature without falling over into the abyss. He did it skillfully and surgically with every ounce of his muscles, including those of his jaw's and lips. Absolutely fascinating to watch.",literal
"Frankenstein: The Most Pretentious Corpse of the Year I can't stand Guillermo del Toro's style.

He always wants to preach and sacrifice his ""innocent"" characters in the name of a message.

He doesn't tell stories-he moralizes them.

Frankenstein is the latest proof.

Two and a half hours of guilt disguised as visual poetry, where everything looks important but nothing feels alive.

Del Toro turns the monster into a symbol-an immortal, spotless, unkillable being that inspires neither fear nor compassion.

It's the perfect victim for his speech about ego, redemption, and guilt.

But in his obsession with turning every scene into a moral lesson, he forgets the most essential thing: to entertain.

What in Shelley's novel was science, terror, and human tragedy becomes here an aesthetic penance.

Everything is slow, solemn, and visually flawless-but completely hollow.

Frankenstein doesn't make you think; it makes you wait for it to end.

And, as always, while the critics applaud, Guillermo del Toro rehearses his Oscar speech.",literal
"Just made no sense I wanted this movie to be fun and witty, with some twists and turns that resulted in a decent Friday night experience. However, this movie ""makes less sense than Cloud Atlas"" (actual quote by the boyfriend). The writers/directors tried desperately to make more twists and turns than is possible in any realm of reality or fiction, there was little to no character development, and I was disappointed. You can tell that they spent a TON of money getting wonderful actors, awesome lighting and special effects, but it was wasted because even though we are pretty smart people, very little about the magic tricks and especially the ending made any sense whatsoever. I gave this movie 6/10 for its visual effects and camera work, but the story sucks. There's a line ""always be the smartest guy in the room,"" and it feels like the writer was obsessed with being smarter than his own audience, which is insulting and lame.",literal

"A fairytale gone bad Better call Saul!...in my opinion as good as BB. BCS has everything. Action, drama....but it's deeper. It's about remorse, regrets and mistakes that we make in life. I thing that everyone can feel Jimmy McGill.

The cast is brilliant in every way. The story brilliant too.

The last episode is just heartbreaking. Especially the last scene between Jimmy and Kim. They two deserved to be together. But Kims and Jimmys love story, (and they still loves each other), is a fairytale that gone bad. Neither of them are bad people. But some choices with combination of unlucky destiny, made things impossible for them to be together.

Watching Kim walking away from the prison...the way Jimmy looks at her and she looks at him...you can see that they still love each other. You can see Jimmys regret for bad choices he made and for those choices he has lost Kim.

Just heartbreaking...bad we know that it wouldn't be a good ending, as in BB.

Better call Saul is the best show I have ever seen.",literal
"Palm Royale I have been surprised by the lukewarm reception this show seemed to have received when it was first released. The viewers' score suggests it is mediocre at best, but it is definitely above average with a thoughtful plot and cast. Admittedly, it gets off to a slower start, but really picks up around the third episode. The cliffhangers hook viewers' interests just enough to keep them wanting more, and the humor is just surreal enough to prevent viewers from guessing what will happen next. The mysteries are not complex, but are absolutely fun, light enough to be entertaining, but do not require too much concentration. It is worth a watch. Do it for Carol and Kristen, whose comedic chemistry sizzles.",literal
"Everyone said the same thing about ""The Office"" ""The British version was so much better. Why mess with perfection?""

I haven't watched ""British TV"" since Monty Python in the 70's. I took ""The Office"" on face value and that's exactly what should be done with ""Ghosts"". If you do that, you will find a very humorous sitcom without a laugh track or an obvious agenda which will give you, at a minimum, a couple giggles every episode. While the leading couple, specifically the husband, is horribly miscast, the remaining ghosts and supporting characters (eg, the neighbors) seem to make up for that faux pas.

Definitely worth a watch with an open mind and without any preconceptions.",literal
"""The Last Frontier"" (Season 1, 2025, 6.5/10) ""The Last Frontier"" (Season 1, 2025, 6.6/10) tries to combine the dark atmosphere of a northern thriller with the dynamics of a police drama but never finds the right balance. After five episodes it becomes clear: the idea is interesting but the execution tires with its predictability and lack of genuine tension.

The action takes place in the harsh conditions of Alaska where a police officer faces a group of escaped convicts. At first it seems we're in for a tight survival thriller, but quite soon the plot slides into repetitive chases and confrontations. The dialogues sound functional, without subtext or vitality, and the characters act more out of formula than from inner motivation.

The characters remain sketchy: their inner conflicts are only hinted at but never revealed. Even the harsh Alaskan landscapes - filmed with obvious care, featuring a cold palette, minimalism and the echoing sounds of wind and snow - create the right sense of isolation. But without a strong story that feeling quickly turns into monotony.

In conclusion: ""The Last Frontier"" is a project with decent potential but weak storytelling. It's not a failure, yet it's not a series you'll want to come back to. After a few episodes it becomes clear that beneath the layer of cold and harshness lies a story lacking both life and genuine suspense.",figurative

"Waste of a great cast. The story is cheesy and the writing is cringy, full of shallow and cliche feminist quips. While I find Kim charming in her reality show, it was a mistake to put her next to the likes of Glenn Close and Sarah Paulson. Paulson's rock star performance of the villain in this show is the only edge it's really got.

Overall, I got the impression that they spent all the money on talent and celebrity but forgot about the script, which seemed like it was written by an intern and ChatGPT.",figurative
"Pretty good for a classic thriller Liam Neeson usually, but not always, picks good action-thriller projects, and this one doesn't disappoint.

"Crests and Falls Paul Thomas Anderson has given us a film that refuses to sit still.

Midway through, there's a sequence where skateboarders cut through darkness, leaping between rooftops while Leo's character follows. The camera captures something transcendent in their movement, turning concrete and night air into a moment of pure cinema. You can feel the risk and freedom in every frame.

The car chase near the end deserves special mention. What makes it work isn't speed or frantic cutting-it's restraint. Anderson lets the camera do the work, never rushing, allowing tension to accumulate as circumstances shift and tighten around the characters. Things evolve slowly, deliberately, until the conclusion arrives with genuine satisfaction.

Sean Penn delivers a performance full of specific choices and memorable mannerisms. The entire cast brings their best, but Benicio del Toro lights up the screen in every appearance. His scenes with DiCaprio are a highlight-two actors working at the top of their craft.

The film weaves comedy, drama, and action together with organic ease. Anderson trusts his audience to stay with him, and the result is deeply engaging. This is the kind of film that reveals more on repeat viewing and will find its place among the classics.",literal
"Far too many cringy characters This show is obviously aiming to copy some of the past mockumentary comedies such as The Office and Parks & Rec. But what made those shows so great (aside from exceptional writing) is the proper mix of cringy characters with honorable/likable ones. The Office Had Dwight (cringy/unlikable), Michael (cringy/likable), but they also had Jim and Pam (honorable/likable) and several other decent people (Oscar, Stanley, Phyllis, Ryan) to round things out.

St. Denis Medical has one likable/honorable person and the rest are all buffoons. How did any of them graduate high school, never mind get employed at a medical facility?

I made it through eight episodes because I like so many of the actors, but now I'm done. It's sad because there are so few sitcoms these days.",literal
"Two very different seasons (EDIT: A few words about Season 3) I guess plenty of people have said a lot of things about all the movie and TV references this series has and how it recreates the eighties in all their faults and splendor. I will not add to that.

With the release of the second season I'd simply like to advise that both seasons are very different animals. Think of it as the difference between the original Alien movie and the Aliens sequel: Whereas the first season was more about an unknown and unseen horror and the mystery behind the backstory, the second has more in-your-face action and horror laced with character development arcs which feel nice but sometimes sidetrack the series a bit.

Consequently, a fan of the show should probably watch the second season as a separate work of fiction rather than a true continuation of the first season in tone and spirit. The writers move the story forward and we get a very good piece of entertainment but the new season has to be judged on its own merits.

EDIT: Season 3 turned out to be a huge change in tone for the series. Maybe it's really hard keeping up the mystery if much of the ""world"" of Stranger Things already yielded many of its secrets but the overall ""feel"" of the series went into a different direction. Maybe the writers simply ran out of 80' templates to rip off. Season 1 was very much inspired by supernatural horror as in ""Poltergeist"". Season 2 took many cues from ""Creature Features"" like ""Gremlins"" or ""Aliens"". Season 3 now uses elements of 80' zombie flicks and low budget gore horror with a little bit of spy comedy mixed in (and fight scenes which feel straight out of ""Die Hard""). All those genres didn't really mix well in the 80' and this strange cocktail sure doesn't work today. That doesn't mean that Season 3 is bad. It simply relies on characters who were established in previous seasons which used very different 80' story elements and tropes. It's almost like seeing Darth Vader in an Indiana Jones movie. Both work on their own but not together.

Basically, Season 3 is an all too transparent attempt to plough a fresh nostalgia field but it doesn't work in the context of previous seasons.",literal
"Decent,but inconsistent OK, first of all to all the 1-star-raters: Seriously? Have you ever watched a bad movie? Watch Sharknado, then you know what an 1-star-movie ist.....even if you hate the adaptation, you have to take into account camera, editing, acting - everything. This is simply not a 1-star-movie. I do understand why some enthusiastic people give it a 10-star.rating, but again: seriously? There are some weaknesses in the series and what bothers me most is the inconsistency of quality. There are some really great scenes where everything fits: acting, camera, cinematogrphy, costumes, lighting....they are woth a 10. But then there are scene that really look like they have been taken from a cheap monster B-movie. The scene with the elven king in the caves....I thing most cosplayer would have gotten the better. There are some scenes that are just over the top tacky, especially when it comes to magic (the mages tower, Brokillon Forest).

"Finnish John Wick A gold miner in Finland near the end of WWII runs afoul of a squadron of Nazis. He then conducts a one-man war on the Germans in the most graphic and violent way possible. There is no sparing the blood and body parts all over the screen and not a minute goes by without someone getting shot, stabbed, beaten or hung.

The movie starts out really well and the pace is perfect and the blood and gore is entertaining. But it goes a bit over the top about half way through as it appears the protagonist is immortal. It removes some of the stakes as you realize this guy will survive anything. I kept expecting to find out he had made a deal with the devil or something because he was indestructible like John Wick x 10.

If you have 90 minutes to spare, its a fun actioner, but it could have been much better had they toned down the violence just a notch and enhanced the story more. I understand a sequel is in the works.",literal
"Still fun Weird Science is a wild and off the wall coming of age comedy by John Hughes. I would not regard this as his best work, but it still holds up decent as fun 80's style entertainment. While very dated, the movie is still pretty funny and totally outrageous. Two lonely, but likeable nerds Gary and Wyatt create ""the perfect woman"" on their computer, which brings to life the stunning Kelly LeBrock and the film is a non stop party until the movie ends. Anthony Michael Hall returns again as nerd icon and has great support roles from Bill Paxton and Robert Downey Jr. As silly as the film is, it has some heart and Gary and Wyatt are very sympathetic characters. Weird Science might not hold up as well as some other 80's classics, but I still found this to be enjoyable many years later.",figurative
"So good I watched it twice. I literally watched this twice over 2 days.

Admittedly, I didn't pay huge attention the first time around.

An extremely good, weel scripted mini series. With even better casting!

I love true history stuff, and I guess this would have made a good movie imo.

But regardless of that, I personally thought it was great.

A lot of historical research went into this mini series. Like the White House being set in open grounds, where people could literally go and knock on the door!

It seems crazy that there was zero thought about security back then. Even after Lincoln was assassinated, I'd have thought he'd have some security, but apparently that wasn't the case until much later after Garfield's death, in fact, it wasn't until another president was assassinated in 1901 (McKinley) that the Secret Service formed in 1902.

And they've only lost one president so far... And more to date, they almost lost another one!

So the most important man on earth (arguably) needs protection.

Literal body men, who's job it is to take bullets for the primary, aka: president.

Politics used to be a bit different back in the day.

For example, he found the federal reserve which had previously been held by the New York collectors or the ""stalwarts."" Garfield's real focus was on equality for all, and no man shall be treated differently to any other.

He was a true fighter for the civil rights movement.

All of this after he took command of a mostly black regiment during the war, and against order's, went on to claim back some territory from the Rebels. So he was well qualified to be president, and I believe he'd have made an excellent one, had it not been for creepy ""Charlie Get Out"" And may his name continue to slip into forgetting obscurity.

Great watching.",figurative
"Frontier of cliches, contrivance, and the miscast. Initially in episode one, ""The Last Frontier"" teases the viewer with an intriguing premise of a covert air transport loaded with dangerous convicts and an ominous Hannibal-esque hooded villain crash landing in the frozen wilderness of Alaska with homage nods to ""Con Air"", ""The Fugitive"", and ""The Hunted"".

Unfortunately after the promising opening, the wreakage of ""The Last Frontier"" quickly smoulders into a slushy, sloggy mess with the following episodes following other uninteresting tangent story arcs.

There are some fundamental problems with ""The Last Frontier"". The writing clearly demonstrates the writers do not have a basic, let alone any practical knowledge of Alaska, roles of US Federal Marshals as opposed to the FBI, federal prisoner transport or subsequent federal manhunt protocols, or the completely covert separate operations for CIA detainees and black sites. Instead federal agencies are just globbed together like a spam and potato ""Gubmint stew"" to make the plot happen.

The shaky plot loses credibility quickly, devolving into a juvenile, boring, cliched cat-and-mouse game between tired US Marshal guy and terribly miscast super spy guy.

The miscasting continues with pouty wine mom ""Discount Jennifer Lawrence"", the supposed creator and principal handler of super asset/agent mastermind code named ""Havlock"", which is the towering, menacing--, ok- short, snarky guy from the FX shows ""Preacher"" and ""That Dirty Black Bag"" How did she create super spy guy when she only demonstrates the skill of whining? Don't know. But pouty wine mom's boss lady said wine mom super asset handler is responsible. Yeah, it is as stupid as it sounds.

The miscasting in ""The Frontier"" doesn't help this bleak tundra of bad writing, plot contrivances, and cliched script.",literal
"Nice Change At 2:17am every child from Justine's class got out of bed, ran from their homes and never came back, every child bar one.

The film splits its main story into chapters coming from 6 different perspectives that all interlock. Our main characters are Justine, one of the kids father Archer, and the one kid who wasn't take, Alex. As we delve deeper into the story we get a small bit closer to understanding what happened and why it happened.

Okay, I enjoyed this, I enjoyed it a good bit but I did leave wanting more in less time.

Firstly the acting is TOP notch, Julia Garner is great and for me Josh Brolin was the most interesting of the adults while Alex played by Cary Cristopher stole the show, amazing acting. The music was creepy, visuals were good and it was shot really well, the story itself was strong.

The pace I had an issue with, maybe a little reshuffle of the character chapters or in my opinion 2 could have been dropped, and some more fleshed out, every time you get somewhere you are yanked back, that's cool for a while but like 6 times, a little too much.

It sounds crazy but I would have liked a little more fright !! I wouldn't class the movie as a horror, not necessarily more jumps but the kids I thought would be more creepy.

Regardless of the picks, it's a good movie and worth a trip to the cinema, the story of WHY AND WHO I really liked, 8/10.",literal
"I tried. It's just so dull. When something so lackluster is getting so many 10 star reviews, it's a sign that people are panicking. Also, there was very little promotion for this series. It just showed up one day. So, they chose not to spend money on marketing. The fact it is based on a book that no one cared about says a lot.

The bottom line in a failed series is that if you have no empathy for the characters, you won't care what happens to them.",literal
"Wanted to like it, but... I just couldn't enjoy this film. I found the flick to be pretentious and the story jumps the gun far too often for the plot to hold any weight from the message being conveyed.

Yes, the film has some gorgeous cinematography and the acting is great, but that is about where the good stops for this one. The story goes absolutely nowhere. In about the last quarter of the film, I had felt like I finally got a grip on what Jennifer Lawrence's character was going through and why she kept doing these crazy things to herself, and I had thought, what a perfect way to end this film. Then it continued for another 25 minutes and lost me again with the meaning behind the film. It was as frustrating as seeing Lawrence's pregnant belly shrink and unshrink throughout the film, at intervals that make no sense.

The best part of the film is easily Jennifer Lawrence's acting. She was what made the film, at least somewhat, entertaining. Not a whole lot of a transformation for herself, she is doing a lot of what she did in 'Mother!' here as well, but it works in the film's favor. The actor who should not have been in this is Robert Pattinson. Very miscast role. It's not that he's a bad actor, it's that his acting is dry and emotionless. This role required someone with a more tender screen presence. Had they stuck with the idea I had thought they were going with, he would've been just fine, but, again, then the movie went on for another 25 minutes, making you feel bad for his character, and obliterated that idea out of my head.

Overall, I couldn't recommend it. The meaning and emotion that could have been are all lost in this messy soup of a film. The acting is great and the cinematography is a stand out, but the lack of a cohesive plotline, an ending that dragged on and on, and the very miscast husband pushed this film all the way to the ground by the end of it. A shame, a daring and provocative performance just wasted because of somebody's idea of 'avent garde elevated cinema'.

Do you like foot pursuit chase scenes? YEAH YEAH YEAH You could play a drinking game and pass out watching this show. Take a drink every time Jubal yells obvious next steps to his team and another when he says YEAH YEAH YEAH when another team member mentions the obvious. Take a drink whenever Jubal shakes head. Down your drink whenever the agents locate a suspect and then yell out their name and that they just want to talk before the suspect takes off starting an every episode foot pursuit. Take another drink when they inevitably shoot and kill a suspect that they really needed to talk to. Most of the episodes are really good. There isn't much to them but entertaining enough to binge and not miss out on a continuing story line. If you've still got any drink left near the end of the episode finish your bottle when Jubal looks really serious and gets quiet.,literal
"Funny, Funny, Funny This is the one Christmas movie that I don't anyone can ever get tired of. Chevy Chase returns in the third installment of the Vacation series as Clarke W. Griswold as he tries desperately to maintain his sanity during the holidays with all of his relatives coming to stay under his roof and enduring all the mishaps along the way.

This is the funniest film in the series plain and simple.  Chevy Chase has never been better.  Christmas Vacation is filled with countless jokes and gags that it's impossible not to laugh.

"WICKED IS A MASTERPIECE!!! WOW!!! This film exceeded my expectations. Can we talk about how BLOWN AWAY I was by both Ariana and Cynthia's performances, and honestly the entire cast!

Ariana wasn't kidding when she said she put her entire heart and soul into preparing for the role of Glinda. This is a dream come true for her, and I couldn't think of anyone else for this role.

Cynthia's belting was out of this world. She stepped into the role of Elphaba with ease.

The singing was LIVE mind you.... including the stunts.

I will be watching a million times in theaters (and hopefully soon on digital) in anticipation for Part 2!",figurative
"Lots of laughs, but a hard watch if you've been there This movie had me laughing so hard, but also crying my eyes out whenever I wasn't laughing. I don't know how intentional that was, but watching this movie brought me back to the moments I truly lived these moments. I think many of us know how it feels, especially if you've experienced chronic homelessness like I have. Life in today's gig economy is soul crushing. And this film acknowledges that while trying to also pull you out of it by not just telling you you're not alone, but truly making you FEEL like you're not alone. It doesn't give unrealistic answers or solutions, it doesn't pretend like the ending is always happily ever after. But it does tell you that there is someone out there with you to make things just the littlest bit better. To make things just a little less harder. And that is worth sticking around.",literal
"A Fascinating Study of Pandemic Life Through The Western Genre Finally, a film addresses the giant elephant in the room that in the last five years has sent the country spiralling even further into political and identity tribalism, the ascendance of authoritarianism, etc., which the media likes to pretend it never stoked (as if Jan. 6th was all based on one discontented president's rhetoric and not also on thousands of jobs lost due to shutdowns): the Covid-19 Pandemic. The ever busy Pedro Pascal and always adventurous Joaquin Phoenix are great as Mayor and Sheriff at political odds in the tiny town of Eddington, New Mexico (really Truth or Consequences) with mask restrictions that drove many a citizen crazy in 2020-1 (the plot only seems a bit of an overreach by conflating AI into the mix, an issue that really didn't enter the national conversation until late 2022 at the earliest). Emma Stone is very funny as Joaquin's doll-obsessed, frigid wife, and the film has a charming, homespun quality that recalls other New Mexico-set films like ""Welcome To Mooseport"" and ""White Sands"" (I tried to be an extra when it filmed a year ago this past April but missed the window, finding only ""Welcome Eddington!"" marquees at various drive-ins). With NM's usually vibrant film scene slowed to a snail's pace due to tariffs and such (Superman was essentially fighting a fitter, younger Don), it's great we still have challenging, well-written films like this emerging in 2025 among all the usual play-it-safe remakes and reboots. Check out Eddington; at least it'll give you something to talk about.",literal
"Unforgettable A dramedy centering around the relationship between a thirtysomething single mother and her teen daughter living in Stars Hollow, Connecticut.

"great political drama! I binge wathed it at one grasp. Since I am originally from Europe I knew nothing about this President, his life and impact. At the moment drama looked like some mob movie ...

"Cute, funny, harmless, enjoyable sitcom I wasn't sure what to expect when I saw Nobody Wants This pop up on Netflix, but we weren't watching anything else at the time, so we gave it a chance. And I am sure glad I did.

It's a cute, funny Rabbi-meets-Shiksa tale, but manages to be funny and engaging. I learned more about Jewish culture than I previously knew. Occasionally there's a joke I don't get, but most of them are familiar enough that they get a laugh out of most anyone without resorting to stereotypes.

My only complaint is that, like all sitcoms, major conflict situations are created, struggled with, and resolved, all within 22 minutes. I'm looking forward to Season 2.",literal
"Dull Peaky Blinders it isn't .... In the least. I found the characters rather dull and one dimensional. All except the promoter for the USA and later election. He was way over the top and a mere caricature. I just couldn't find a reason to care about any of them.

The music was horrible. Putting modern music to period pieces is a travesty. And it was way too loud and annoying.

This show will never be on my watch list.",literal
"Keeps you guessing until the end Eternity is a sweet, fun film that presents an impossible problem yet solves it in a way that feels earned.

Hoping to learn more about her donor, Carlos, she travels to his remote and secretive hometown of Yesques, located 4 hours from Madrid.

"Average but worth a watch A solid 6

I was so looking forward to this movie. We have waited a long time for it (27yrs) I wanted not to be disappointed but....it was all just very average.

Before I continue I want to make it clear the love I have for the original TV mini series. It was on repeat in my house as a child and I feel nothing but nostalgia (and fear) when I think of it or watch it. So to see this new version miss out on some of the vitals that made the original so special was disappointing.

Things I didn't like. The kids were not innocent or naive enough. The original story took place in 1960 when of course it was a more innocent time. This was lost in this new film as it was set in 1989. The constant babbling between the boys was really annoying and pointless to the story. When the kids were all experiencing their individual encounters with Pennywise there was zero structure with no purpose or history to their encounter. The kids were flakey, they didn't have the strong individual personalities needed to make them distinguishable. The second part to the mini series heavily relied on us caring about the kids in the first half then continuing their stories as adults and how their lives had panned out since leaving Derry. In the 2017 remake the only ones I cared about was Bill, Beverly and Ben the others just blurred into one character. Too much cgi!! Poor and not scary! Most disappointing was the cgi encounters that were not Pennywise e.g. the lady in the painting, the headless man in the library and the zombie creature outside the derelict house. Why even bother it was done so badly. I also never really got the feeling from this film of how wrong and bad things are in Derry I felt this was skirted over a little. And last but not least a lot of the scenes with Pennywise I couldn't help but notice his contacts (eyes) or whatever they used for his eyes were in wrong so took away from the experience of fear as I was too busy wondering what was wrong with his eyes! And no mention of dead lights anywhere :(

Things I did like. Most of the scenes with Pennywise packed a punch and were frightening. I liked how they linked the famous phrase 'they all float down here' to a visual in the end scenes. I liked the creepy chemist character and Mr Marsh, to me they represented Derry and all that was wrong with it. Bill, Ben and Beverly all great and well developed characters. Good humour throughout and it was used at correct times in film.

Bad out ways the good unfortunately but I do think this film has done well in continuing the clown fear legacy!",figurative
"Dutton family and their sprawling Montana ranch. This series has been on since 2018 but now is the first time I have watched any of it. Last night I completed the first episode of the first season, it runs right near 90 minutes. As to introduce the Dutton family we see they have powerful influence in their valley but are fending off ""attacks."" One from developers who want to put up condos. Another from the neighboring Native reservation looking to get some of their land back plus some livestock. To help deal with all that and the sprawling size of his ranch Dutton (played authentically by 60-something Kevin Costner) has several grown Cowboy sons and a helicopter with a dedicated pilot.

The reason I watched episode one of season one (on Peacock streaming) was to get the feel for the Dutton family because I am currently watching the ten episodes of the more recent Taylor Sheridan program ""1883"" which is the prequel of sorts. It was (fictionally) in 1883 that the Dutton family from Tennessee joined a larger group to wagon train from Fort Worth Texas to ""somewhere in the West"". They must have stopped when they reached Montana.

Again it is all fiction but if we look at the ages of the men, and the fact that Costner was born in 1955, his character would probably be the great, great grandson of the Dutton patriarch (played by Tim McGraw) in ""1883"". E.g. With sons born about 1875, 1900, 1925, and the 1950s.

""Yellowstone"" is a really fine series, the actors are all first-rate, the cinematography and sound are excellent. It just ins't the kind of program I could get invested in and continue to watch. It is hard to find characters with redeeming qualities and I really don't long-term enjoy programs which constantly focus on arguments and fights, and often killing. Now in my 70s I prefer to spend time watching ""pleasant"" stories.

NB - ""1883"" is a really fine and interesting series, how it authentically depicts the great hardship of pulling up roots and traveling through unknown territories to try to find a new life in a new place.",literal

"Everything is opposite of beauty, except Oxford I recently rewatched the Roman Holiday. Life was hard and money was short, but optimism and beauty were everywhere. People appeared as people, and women appeared as women. How things have changed in 2025... These series continue to reign on Slough Horses recipe of repulsive protagonists, somalisation of the UK and very low IQ acting. These movies will leave you with the scent of urine, unwashed bodies, adultery as The New Normal and depressed mood.

On balance, the camera work is great, the picture quality excellent and the sound is terrific. And Oxford is still a beautiful place.",literal
Henry Cavill I watch every episode of the series so far. Henry Cavill's portrayal Geralt is the only reason to watch the show. The rest of the cast's performance is forgettable. The script writers are lazy. I hear Netflix is replacing him as Geralt and changing the tone of the show. Netflix seem to not understand or not care what matters to the audience. Netflix continues to self destruct. Destroying such a popular show by removing the one sure draw of it is foolish and makes me want to change my subscription to another service. It is like removing Tom Cruise from Top Gun. Replacing Keanu Reeves as John Wick.,literal
"All's frivolous All's Fair is glossy, shallow and absurdly pleased with itself. I never thought displays of wealth could be this cringeworthy.

"Quite funny and almost reminds me of The Office I loved the first two episodes of this show that were aired so far. Shows a lot of promise. The style the show is produced reminds me of The Office. Shot like as if it's some kind of a documentary. It was light and fujust

The series is scheduled for an 18 episode 1st season. And will also be aired on BBC in addition to NBC and peacock.

Among all the new comedies that NBC has released recently, this seems to be one of the best. Extended family was kind of funny but appears like it has been canceled and they won't be a second season. Lopez vs Lopez in my opinion should have been canceled a long time ago. Somehow they have managed to keep that boat floating. In comparison to these, St Denis Medical so far has been hilarious. I hope, the rest of the season is as good as these first two episodes. This might just be another show that might have more than just one or two seasons. I'm thinking maybe 10.. fingers crossed!!!",literal

"Armond legendary performance I didn't expect to enjoy the series after only seeing the trailer. Armond's acting was legendary, just because of him it's worth watching the first season. In the second season, on the other hand, such a character is missing. I didn't even finish it.

"Powerful King is known for the scary things but when he writes about human stories, they're some of the most unforgettable movies made. Shawshank to Stand By Me, you can add this one to the list of ordinary people.

This is not a horror so don't walk in expecting one. This is however a powerful story about what happens when society loses its ability to learn and think for ourselves. We become a police state and this movie tells it in a way that is believable.

We meet our two primary protagonists and a group of unique and funny supporting characters. We learn about who they are and we grow to care for them. This also makes it hard because we know the fate of those we come to like won't make it to the end.

The movie is a metaphor for war where soldiers represent different backgrounds who come together for ""the good of their country."" Or at least that's what the walkers are promised. This movie has some of the most powerful performances of any recent movie in the last few years. Interesting how the cast is of unknown characters so you don't know who will survive. The main antagonist looks a lot like Fidel Castro and is the most feared soldier in the country. This is Kings take also on a revolution where dictators come in through the front door and run the country. We lose our freedom and our individuality.

As I write this, I can't get this movie out of my head. It's a near masterpiece in a powerful story of friendship and loyalty.",figurative
"Really wanted this to be a different movie. First, I saw this as a blind sneak preview, and had hoped that it would be a different movie that's opening at the same time and has approximately the same playing length and is a musical starting J. Lo. So yes, I did want it to be a different movie, literally.

But knowing that the movie was Roofman, I thought, OK, the previews looks pretty good. (spoiler alert - all the good parts are in the previews). It wasn't. The movie I wanted would have been a slightly slapstick, slightly naughty, rom-com where the guy and girl meet cute, begin a relationship, she finds out who he really is (not a spoiler, he's an escaped felon sentenced to 45 years for robbing a McDonald's and locking the employees in the meat locker), and then after some soul searching and argument somehow rehabilitates him, and they live happily ever after. At least this is how it would be on the Hallmark Channel.

This was not that movie. What it was, was a vehicle for Channing Tatum to exhibit more of his goofball charm, while at the same time, via voiceover, seem to make excuses for himself over and over and over again to ""justify"" his behavior and, what, feel sorry for and sympathize with him? (""I wasn't good at school, but I was good in the military, but when they cut me loose, I didn't know what to do to get my daughter that bicycle that she wanted, but I was good at noticing things, so I started robbing McDonald's. Do you blame me?"") That sort of thing. And it's repeated over and over again. (Look how clever I was when I made up a little apartment for myself right under everyone's noses!).

Truth is, he was just a charming low life.

So what happens? Not much. Halfway through the movie, when you expect things to start picking up, he's just lolling in bed with the woman who works in the store he was holed up in after church. Nothing has happened in an hour except for this. He gets arrested, goes to prison, escapes (not in an exciting way), hides out in a Toys R Us and meets and sleeps with a divorced mother struggling to make a life while working for a jerk of a boss at a toy store.

No one stands out in this, other than the lead. Channing Tatum is his usual goofy, charming self (he's even this in the Magic Mike movies). Kirsten Dunst is just bland as the divorced mother. And Peter Dinklage, usually so brilliant in just about everything he does, is just wasted as the cynical, mean for the sake of it toy store manager.

Even the filming had a dull, grainy quality, as it it were pretending to be an old Super 8 or home video from the 80s. Nothing crisp and exciting, all muted colors and blurry backgrounds.

I can't give the end away (other than, you know, it's an actual documented true story - you can look it up) because I got bored and walked out halfway through. I had better things to do than waste it with these people (and we were not the only ones to leave early).

So unless you're a serious Channing Tatum fan (he does take off his shirt to wash in the toy store bathroom), there's so much better opening this weekend. Pick one of those.

I really do wish this was a different movie.",figurative
"GREAT BUT WORRYING START This episode really surprised me, I was expecting the typical ""stranger things"" weird nerd kids type trope, and then everything got flipped on it head. I also love the fact that this is R-Rated, which doesn't put so many limitations on the horror that the creators could possibly imagine. Really amazing first episode.

Now why am I worried? The kids who got done in were very interesting to follow, they had unique personalities and interests. Even though I loved the shocking thing that happens in the end, I can't help but worry that the two female leads that are left are just boring to follow. I wasn't invested in their story as I was on the other two boys, who not only had their families play a role in the story, but they also had their own future dreams, personalities and you could tell more growth to come before all was cut short. This story will have to do some groundbreaking stuff to keep me interested in following characters I don't even like tbh. Even Matty is a much better lead despite having less screen time. Also the soldiers who are also the leads? Not interested in them either tbh, but they aren't as boring at least. Overall I loved the first episode, I'm just worried on how the story will move forward now.",literal
"White Noise Unfortunately the film is not exactly subtle, it is way too often exaggerated and too loud. He does not go into the emotional one, so what really happens to do such things with the psyche of one, but rather makes jokes or cuts directly to a quiet teeth, wasting his full potential. In addition, nothing in this movie is subtly so exaggerated music, too loud jumpscares, too loud sound effects and so on. There were a few things that I liked but the negative things cover the positives and I think the book was not adapted very well but too superficially just flown over.",literal
"Ridiculous to enjoyable The first half of this movie, the only word that came to mind was *ridiculous*. Starring Alicia Silverstone, it reminded me a lot of her ""Clueless"" movies and about as silly and ridiculous . But once you get past the middle, it was really enjoyable, fun and heartwarming!

Fun to see Pierson Fode again after seeing him in ""The Wrong Paris"".. this was a pretty hilarious role for him!",literal
"Downvote me all you want. Objectively, this show is bad. Resume: 1. Premise is old and used a million times 2. Characters are terrible 3. Dialogue is terrible 4. Acting is terrible 5. Nothing really happens 6. DEI strikes again 7. The 9s and 10s given here are for the most part, artificial reviews to crank up the score.

Developing: 1.

Invasion of the Body Snatchers meets They Live meets The Last Man on Earth. There's absolutely no originality in this story. If you think this show is ""fresh"" and ""original"", i assume your film culture is pretty damn low.

2. A scientist taking her hazmat glove to check a pulse on a dead rat that is being subjected to lab experiments is Idiocracy level of stupidity.

Main character is the typical self centered clumsy karen who thinks she's right all the damn time. Oh and she's traumatized that she ""talked herself out of writing her book's hero as a girl"", because wink wink didnt you notice, she's lesbian. Oh man who the hell cares that your book character is your lgbtq self insert in 2025? Everyone is doing self inserts in shows!

Kill more people with your tantrums, karen. Makes us hate you and humanity even more.

3. Who wrote these dialogues? There's an underlying issue of individual power vs absence of agency, but all the writers apparenly care for is making us believe that white men are a rare ethnicity and gender on Earth and that all comes down to us (conscious free will driven humans) versus them (the collective socialist hivemind).

What a superficial take on the subject matter...

4.

Karen is basically a class act of overacting. Always shouting, wavering her body too much and trying to sound angry. Not one moment did she spent just mourning her agent and partner. No, every inch of this woman is spite and anger. Onedimensinal as hell. The rest of the characters are shallow and accessories.

5. If you think it through, after the main event where everyone turns into a mindless drones, the plot does not develop much further for most of the episodes. They go from here to there and stuff happens, but nothing truly meaningful to develop key components of the movie or answer any questions. It gives me the impression that this show will follow the same formula as other shows like Lost, Handmaids Tale or From where questions are rarely answered and when they do, they turn into more questions, just to grind on more seasons.

6. Not a fan of complaining about this stuff, but i'm kind tired of seeing these shows that strive to ""represent"" and be ""diverse"" constantly failing to represent the same ethnicity like they're now suddenly rare pokemons on Earth. The cast is a perfect shuffle of ethnic diverse groups. The irony is that the showrunners in their diversity virtue signaling ended up portraying the other survivors as mindless cult followers and even the african black guy as a thief and a pervert. Way to go showrunners!

7. It's pretty obvious that IMDB and other sources have been targeted with many highly positive reviews for this show. You can kind of see that most are fake. By the hysterical, hyperbolic language used, just like a ""OMG BEST SHOW EVER"" and along these lines, to crank up the overall score and bring people into watching the show. Because nowadays that's what counts: views and streams. If 1 or 2 episodes have high views they can sell the idea that another season should be greenlit.

All in all, this show is subpar and not worth the praise it's getting at all.",literal
"A Desperate Escape from Failure. Oh, how much I love Stephen King - and just as much I hate seeing his work ruined by mediocre adaptations. The Green Mile, It, Pet Sematary, Doctor Sleep, The Shining... This is my favorite list.

But this film is a complete disappointment. And it's not even about the fact that Arnie's version once worked better - the real problem lies in the story and the pacing.

The first 30 minutes are passable action, giving a faint hope for something energetic and coherent. But then the second act begins, dragging on so painfully that it feels like you're either watching an entirely different movie, or the screenwriter simply walked off set halfway through, leaving the interns to finish the job.

The direction is weak.

Glen Powell tries desperately to save the film with his performance, but without a solid script there's nothing to hold onto. Neither the visuals nor the atmosphere compensate for the complete lack of engagement.

In short: not recommended - except maybe as a lesson in how to squander strong literary material.",literal
"The Black Phone 2: Sadder, Scarier, and Absolutely Brilliant The Black Phone 2 delivers everything a great sequel should - and so much more. It honors the tone and atmosphere of the first movie while diving even deeper into its characters, emotions, and fears. The result is a film that's not only scarier, but also far more powerful and mature.

Madeleine McGraw once again steals the show as Gwen. Her performance is breathtaking - full of emotion, strength, and heart. She's a force of nature, bringing every scene to life with such authenticity that it's impossible to look away. Mason Thames shines as Finney too, showing a more complex and emotional side of his character that makes you feel every moment with him.

The supporting cast also deserves recognition. Each actor adds depth to the story, making every interaction feel raw and real. The chemistry between the characters is one of the film's greatest strengths, grounding the horror in genuine emotion.

There were moments that honestly left me speechless - scenes so intense and beautifully acted that they completely pulled me in. The cinematography is stunning, and the direction captures both the eerie tension and the heartbreaking beauty of the story.

The Black Phone 2 isn't just a good sequel - it's a better film than the original. It's darker, more emotional, and unforgettable. A truly haunting masterpiece that proves this story still has so much to say.",figurative

"Good Fun I've been watching NCIS since it started and have been a regular viewer since the debut. The first reason I tuned in was simple - Mark Harmon. Second reason was, well, Michael Weatherly. David McCallum was just a really nice bonus. That being said ... I know that NCIS as it is shown on the screen is ludicrous, so is CSI and all its off shoots, but if you show what really happens in any investigation you'll chase off the audience with boredom.

Mark Harmon has brought a sense of realism to the Leroy Jethro Gibbs character to the point that my former active duty Marine husband swears up and down that Harmon MUST have been a Gunny in real life. Either this one or a previous one, he's just too good playing a senior NCO Reservist Marine and a cop. Gibbs is also a top-notch ""Training Officer"" who clearly trains all of his people to be able to step up and take control and command of a team in a moment's notice.

Michael Weatherly has matured as an actor - I first noticed him in Dark Angel - and he has wisely chosen to let his character on the show, Anthony ""Tony"" DiNozzo, to mature at a natural rate. Slowly. He's gone from an annoying frat-like not-quite-mature man to a deep thinker and a MUCH better investigator who can handle deep cover assignments if needed. Maybe not as well Gibbs could handle it, but that sort of skill takes time and multiple assignments to be fully qualified (and by then, the Feds tend to ship you off to their Academies so you can teach what you've learned).

Cote de Pablo (Mossad Officer Ziva David) replaced Sasha Alexander (Caitlin ""Kate"" Todd) and I'm probably in the minority when I say ""THANK YOU"" to the casting department for that. I found Todd to be a rather flat, and annoying, character. Oh she had a few lines here and there that were light hearted and worth a giggle - usually at DiNozzo's expense - but for the most part she was played a little too 'boy next door, or trying to be' by Alexander. Cote, at least, has played Ziva as a very capable, and very female, Intelligence Officer. I think this is why most folks don't like Ziva, they expect a Law Enforcement officer type character but she's an Intelligence Agent. Think CIA and kick it up several notches - you don't mess with Mossad unless you have a death wish. Cote clearly realizes this and plays ""Officer David"" with that in mind.

David McCallum, Doctor Donald ""Ducky"" Mallard, is always a joy to see on the screen and I love the 'quirks' David has given Ducky. I suspect there is a history behind Ducky's 'adventure stories' that could easily fill several books - and be considered too implausible to be anything but fiction. Ducky brings a human element to the position of Medical Examiner, a warmth that civilians don't think M.E.'s have but usually do. The ones I know also have wicked, if dry, senses of humor and McCallum has joyfully taken the humor route with Ducky and I, for one, appreciate it.

Another quirky character is, of course, Pauley Perrett's Abby Scuitto, Goth Forensic Scientist. Her portrayal of Abby is spot on as Pauley is the only person I've heard of playing a Criminal Scientist who actually has the sheepskin in the discipline. Nothing like a touch of realism to bring a character to life! Of course, people complain that Scuitto shouldn't be permitted to work in a federal job with the obvious life style she has - to you I say, HorseFeathers. If Abby were less capable at her job, she wouldn't be there as long as she has been. Nor would any of her supervisors put up with her oddities.

Now to speak of the other ""Geek"" on the team - Timothy McGee. Techno-geek. Keyboard Wizard. Sean Murray needs to do only one thing to make me totally happy with his character and his protrayl of McGee-cut his hair! I realize that the McGee character has a life outside of NCIS - as a published novelist no less - and probably keep his hair on the long side to emphasize his Authorial Air but... I hate the way it's flopped in his face this past season.

The writing on this show, like others, is usually tight but like other shows there are episodes where the writing was clearly 'off' when the idea was dreamt up or the script approved. The fact that the cast can take a lousy script and still get a watchable show out of it, is nothing short of amazing. Is NCIS accurate? No. Is NCIS a good way to learn about the Marine Corps or the Navy? Uh, no. Better talk to a recruiter if you're thinking of joining the military. Is NCIS good fun? YEAP!",figurative
"Did you watch because it's actually good Glenn Powell continues to prove he's one of Hollywood's most underrated talents, and Chad Powers might be the strongest example yet. While audiences have enjoyed him in films like Twisters and several charismatic supporting roles, this series lets him stretch in ways that feel both fresh and surprisingly heartfelt. His performance channels the spirit of Mrs. Doubtfire-a transformative disguise, comedic timing, and emotional stakes-but reimagined through a modern, distinctly masculine lens. The result is a character who is not only hilarious but also deeply engaging.

From its first episode, the series establishes a sharp sense of identity. With only six episodes in its first season, Chad Powers wastes no time hooking the audience with its blend of comedy, drama, and unexpected twists. The director deserves major credit for crafting a show that remains consistently captivating. Every episode feels purposeful, each moment designed to draw viewers deeper into the chaos and charm of the story. Shocks arrive frequently, but never cheaply-they feel earned and smartly integrated into the overarching narrative.

The writing is one of the show's biggest strengths. The screenplay is tightly wound, energetic, and impressively focused. Every narrative thread feels connected, and viewers are never allowed to drift or lose interest. There's a confidence in the storytelling that makes even the wildest moments feel grounded in emotional truth. The humor is sharp without overshadowing the drama, and the drama never becomes heavy enough to drown out the fun. It's a delicate balance that the writers maintain impressively well.

Powell's dual performance gives the series its heart. Switching between personas with ease, he captures the silliness of the premise while still grounding the character in real vulnerability. His ability to embody two completely different identities and make both believable is a testament to just how much range he really has. And while he commands the screen, the supporting cast elevates the show around him rather than fighting for space.

One major standout is the female coach, Perry Mattfeld, who quickly becomes one of the show's most intriguing forces. She's unpredictable, sharp, and magnetic-never letting viewers get too comfortable. The performance walks that perfect line between comedic intensity and genuine emotional depth. Her scenes with Powell carry an electricity that keeps the tension tight, especially in moments when her expressions leave you unsure whether she's furious, suspicious, or about to unleash something far more dramatic.

In the end, Chad Powers succeeds because it knows exactly what kind of story it wants to tell. It takes a familiar comedic formula and reinvents it with bold performances, strong writing, and vibrant direction. Glenn Powell shines brighter than ever, reminding audiences why he deserves far more recognition than he gets. With only six episodes, the first season leaves viewers hungry for more, and if the show maintains this level of creativity and energy, future seasons could cement it as one of the most standout comedies of its era.",figurative
"Boring and unoriginal Poorly cast, cliched cardboard characters and an overall lack of interesting story hamper this snooze-fest.

"A passion project that doesn't have much for anyone but Stuckmann Well, there isn't a lot to say about Shelby Oaks, not even much to spoil

This movie connects to Chris Stuckmann childhood story, which adds a little bit of understanding for the project. But... duh

It's a generic movie, and this is a generic review. That's hard it is to give it justice. It's an absolutely generic horror film with everything in the kitchen sink. It lacks continuity, development, structure, and confluence. It ends up abruptly with no real resolution, which is normal since it lacks development

I really wanted to give Stuckmann some courtesy, I wanted to give his movie more than a single star, but I ended up regretting that there's no zero here! He hyped it up out of his own passion, but he didn't do his job for his debut. Ngl, I feel cheated!

Total, cringey, waste of time. I'd rather watch the paint dry.",figurative
"Now You See Me I went to the cinema to watch it. What can I say? I had a good time, it was very decent and I enjoyed it. At the same time there was nothing special about it, the movie went so fast that when we got to the climax of it all then I was like: ""that's all?"". I wanted more tricks and stunts. The previous 2 movies I enjoyed more, they were more impressive to me. Everything was happening so fast that I didn't really cared about characters's feelings. Maybe it's just me. But overall it was very decent and worth a watch.",literal
"Better than expected Enjoyable but in the end, sad film. Liam has a role where he can act his age, which is a plus (no sex with hot women half his age). You care about the characters. Sure, it is a bit contrived, but you need to have a story. But it has a bittersweet ending.",literal
"One of the great fifties American melodramas It would be impossible to overestimate the impact this film had on Middle America when it was released in 1954. Apart from the fact that it contained no sex, violence, or horror, so that the entire family could see it together, it was a heady mixture of deep ethical message with extreme romantic melodrama. The film was based on the 1929 best-selling novel of the same title by the Rev. Lloyd C. Douglas (1877-1951), a retired Lutheran minister whose other novel 'White Banners' was made into the first Cinemascope picture the year before, THE ROBE (1953), a corny religious epic about early Christianity starring Victor Mature which was one of the most financially successful movies of all time, and which had hundreds of people queuing round several blocks in cities all over America for several weeks and clamouring to get in. This contemporary, as opposed to historical, story had the good fortune to be directed by Douglas Sirk, the mysterious German refugee from Hitler who immersed himself so deeply in Americana and the minutiae of his New Land that he nearly suffocated from it. This film starred 'the hunk', the tall and muscular leading man Rock Hudson, with whom millions of American women were secretly in love, not one of them suspecting for an instant that he was a wildly promiscuous gay with no interest in women whatsoever. (That was in the days when film studios could keep things like that secret.) The leading lady was Jane Wyman, whose snub nose would not go down well today but then nobody minded. She plays the role very well except that she is only mediocre at pretending to be blind, which she had to be for part of the story. It is very difficult indeed to pretend to be blind, and many actresses have not pulled it off at all well. I am inclined to think the best portrayal of a blind girl on screen was by my very dear and deeply lamented friend Biff Hartmann (1943-1987), in A PATCH OF BLUE (1965), which won her a Golden Globe and an Oscar nomination. Jane Wyman offscreen was a very pleasant, chatty and emotionally needy and insistent person. I never knew her personally but I knew someone who had an involvement with her in the mid-1940s when she was already married to Ronald Reagan, and at that time when transcontinental phone calls were tedious, she thought nothing of phoning New York from California five times a day until she could get through to the man and talk herself back into a state of comfort and hear a few new jokes. The implication I suppose is that she had a tendency when alone to lapse into depressions, and compulsively picking up the phone was her remedy. In this film, Wyman's step-daughter is played by Barbara Rush, aged 27, who does a remarkably fine job of it, with numerous gradations of feeling and a particular delicacy which most actresses would not have brought to what was on paper a rather boring role. This film had originally been made in 1935 with Irene Dunne and Robert Taylor. The underlying basis of the film is the concept of 'secret giving'. Ostensibly, this takes its origin from the Gospel of Matthew, Chapter 6, 1-4, which speaks of not flaunting your good works. However, the concept of 'secret giving' is a Masonic one. Being a Freemason myself, I can assure those who are not that the main purpose of British and American Freemasonry is charitable giving. At least 90% of this is anonymous, in the sense that the public has no idea that the funding comes from the Masons. Most of the money goes to schools, hospitals, and other worthy social and medical causes. The sums involved are often very large indeed. Freemasonry does not mention Jesus or the New Testament, so that it has Jewish and Muslim as well as Christian and atheist members. Masonry does however have a considerable Old Testament component in that there is a rather obsessive preoccupation with Solomon's Temple and its architecture. God is always spoken of as 'the Great Architect of the Universe', and never as 'God'. In that way, 'God', 'Jehovah', 'Zeus', 'Jupiter', 'Allah' and the others are all equally accommodated; indeed, one could even construe the Great Architect as either an impersonal force (i.e. not an old man with a white beard or even a 'being') or even a natural principle rather than any kind of a personality resembling humans. For instance, the Great Architect could just as well be what the ancient Egyptians called 'Maat', which means the all-pervasive 'cosmic order' of which their 'gods' were all considered to be merely facets and aspects. Essentially unaware of the Masonic origin of the 'secret giving' preached very quietly and unobviously in this film through the character of Edward Randolph (played to perfection by Otto Kruger), and of its ability to put the secret giver into direct touch with 'the source of infinite power' and transform him, the millions of Baptists, Methodists, Presbyterians, and others who flocked to this film with their families all over the heartlands of America accepted it as the essential Christian message of charity combined with self-effacement. I know for a fact that many people had their lives changed and their personalities transformed simply by watching this movie. That may sound fantastic today, but one must remember that television was still in its infancy, a tiny black and white flickering image with no power to overwhelm, and so for the really 'big experiences' in entertainment, people still relied upon the big screen of the cinema to be deeply moved. Social and cultural historians need to be aware of these key films which changed America. The story of this film is very over-the-top and much of its plot borders of the ludicrous. But Middle American audiences forgive such things, and the women wept deeply at the melodrama.",literal
"Nothing New in the Nuclear Threat Genre I started to become familiar with Kathryn Bigelow from her association with James Cameron. I saw a couple early films she made in the 1980s, and they were not standouts. Later on I went to see ""Strange Days"" and ""K-19: The Widowmaker"" and still felt that the story being told was not hitting me that hard emotionally. That changed with ""Hurt Locker"" and ""Zero Dark Thirty"", two gripping films that captured a realistic military atmosphere. So it was a bit of a disappointment when I saw her next film, ""Detroit"". In that film there was a narrow scope that hinged it's story on a shocking event, but not worth a making a full length feature on that alone.

A House of Dynamite is her latest feature. Again with a military angle that she mastered in those award winners. However, this story is not centered on an actual event like the previous films. It follows the procedures that would transpire if a nuclear missile was headed toward the United States. Because it is trying to be realistic, I had some problems being convinced about that. Perhaps i'm wrong. But...

MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD

The initial launch was not detected. They say cyberattack prevented the detection. For this story to be realistic, they had to make this conceit.

A missile interception response was limited to a single missile holding two projectiles. It is made clear the military knows the odds are low, so why not fire more interceptors? Or when the first volley missed, why not send a second volley, or try something like a patriot missile? Little is adequately explained about why there is no Plan B.

The playbook for nuclear response seems to be all or nothing. It is suggested that the recommended response is go all out World War III and hit Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran with everything we got.

This end-of-the-world decision we are to believe must be made before the world even knows if this ICBM, that is from an unknown source, is not a dud and nobody gets hurt (we never learn the outcome of the impact). The clock shows impact in 2 minutes and 30 seconds. We can't wait those mere moments to see what happened? It is a single missile hitting Chicago. This in no way would affect the ability of our country to respond. The missile silos in Montana are no where near Chicago. Nuclear submarines are still quietly loitering in the ocean, far far away from Chicago, ready to annihilate the planet. The movie also shows what is presumably Diego Garcia, with a stealth bomber being put into play.

I groaned a bit about this (I was the only one at this screening). Certainly a more rational, more measured response could be considered. Something a little less than armageddon.

So the idea that a decision with historical ramifications for all of mankind needs to happen with no other options and little actual debate seems preposterous.

Another weakness of the film is the structure. We follow pretty much in realtime the detection of the missile to it's moment of impact (around 20 minutes). Instead of showing what happens at that moment, the screen goes black. The movie then rewinds the clock and starts at the moment of missile detection, this time from a different point of view. We rewind at total of three times, with the third showing the point of view of the President.

This is another conceit I believe was deliberate. In this first and second point of view, we hear but do not see the President. However because of his very recognizable heavy Brooklyn accent, we can surmise it is Trump. However, when get to actually see the President, it is Idris Elba, who is from England. He speaks without a Brooklyn accent. I was convinced the movie did this on purpose to defy expectations.

Another major problem with the story is that we get introduced and follow these major characters, but then they disappear. Once the threat becomes imminent, our main characters are escorted to a safe location, and out of the drama unfolding up to that point. For instance we are introduced and spend time with the FEMA administrator. Because we are spending this much time with her, we expect her character to come into play in major way later in the film. Instead she jumps on a bus and is never seen again.

END SPOILERS

The film focuses on how the people involved in the situation would react personally. We see scene after scene of those people contacting their loved ones, even abandoning their posts. This is nothing new, with countless other movies and TV shows having depicted this obvious trope. Yes, of course, that's what would happen. But with so much screen time being devoted to these phone calls, over and over, I did not get emotionally affected like the movie wanted me to.

I will say Rebecca Ferguson is a standout, and her character was the most engaging. But once again she is given relatively little screen time. I give this a 5 out of 10. The story has potential, and the first act was working pretty well in building tension. The acting was competent all around, although some of the dialogue was a little clunky. There are also places where the film's low budget started make this feel like a TV movie.",literal
"Follow your heart kid, and you'll never go wrong. Roger Ebert called this movie ""A Christmas Story"" for summer. It has that nostalgia-coated sheen to it that makes you long for a time you maybe didn't even live through. Luckily, I did. I was 14 in 1962 and baseball was king in pre-Super Bowl America. I don't mind the anachronisms, like the guys high-fiving after a victory, 15 years before Dusty Baker and Glen Burke invented it, or Smalls apparently replacing Vin Scully in the broadcast booth. We actually had a sandlot behind our house where all-day games were played and we built a couple tree houses in the eucalyptus trees that surrounded it. It doesn't just remind me of my youth that's gone, but a country as well, where no one locked their house or car doors and the only thing bad that happened in schools were the cafeteria lunches.

Being a life long (since the '57 World Series) Henry Aaron fan, I loved that the Babe asked Benny for Hank's rookie Tops card.",literal

"Powerful visuals, disappointing results I walked into the theater with high hopes and walked out with an expression on my face like a cracked-brained calf. Essentially, the film was a series of 3 minute videos bound together with a thin rope of plot, and even thinner underlying premise. Vin Diesel may well be the next big thing in leading men of action, but this sure wasn't the vehicle.",literal
"Competent historical folklore tale I very much enjoyed this film based on the Beast of Gevaudan. Until I saw this film I was unaware of the historical event upon which this is based so, I did a bit of research and was fascinated. Personally, I've always been more interested in European history than United States history mostly because there is so much more to explore. I would have given this a higher rating except that the CGI of the beast is, IMHO, is subpar and the fighting style of Mani, while quite impressive, is not close to historical. Regardless, this is a very enjoyable film I can highly recommend; it's well made, captivating, and very enjoyable. Check it out if you enjoy such fare as historical based films.",literal
"Just remember, the core focus of the show is in the title Have only seen the first episode but am aware of misintepretation here!

The show is called WEDNESDAY for a reason - it's the adventures of Wednesday as she navigates unfamiliar territory. It's a character study with some appearances of the rest of the family. If, as some reviewers, you turn up expecting a straight reboot of the 60s sitcom, you'll be disappointed. However, the show seems lovely and Ortega, Christie, and Myers are excellent, there are some wonderful recurring and guest stars and one very delightful blast from the past on the cast.

Also, shout out to the cast and crew - I knew you filmed this during a tought period in Eastern Europe when the war in the Ukraine broke out.",literal

"THE 80's comedy Weird Science is the best 80's comedy that was ever made. I'm saying it. Ghostbusters, Summer Rental, The Great Outdoors, Strange Brew, Gung Ho, Mr. Mom, all of these movies have their place, but none of them can match Weird Science for laughs or pure....eightiesness. Yes eightiesness is a quality. It's a corny, dated quality but one that is tangible and valued by my fellow eighties loving brethren to this day. Come back with me if you will to a time when Anthony Michael Hall was still fielding calls and Kelly LeBrock was French for sexy.

Weird Science has everything that an eighties comedy needs: A least one hot girl, a few actors who are no longer working or who do anything that will come along, plenty of dashing eighties threads, a corny as hell eighties soundtrack,(and Oingo Boingo is as corny and eighties as they get), and plenty of cheap funny jokes. 

Undoubtedly the best thing about Weird Science is Bill Paxton, who plays Wyatt's older brother Chet. Chet is the worst big brother ever to grace a movie screen and is a role model for all big brothers everywhere, me included. Chet delights in extorting money and valuables from Wyatt in exchange for his silence about Wyatt's activities. The best part in the movie is when Chet gets turned into the toad thing or whatever it is. Man I love that part. 

The rest of the cast does a good job of being their stock characters. Kelly LeBrock does a good job of being hot. Robert Downey Jr. shows none of the signs of future drug addiction. The film is unremarkable in the fact that it isn't anything groundbreaking or special. It's just a funny movie. And an eighties classic. 

Bottom Line: If you grew up in the eighties and you never saw Weird Science then you must atone for your crimes by going out and buying it right now. Then send me an email telling me how grateful you are that I put you on the path to rightousness and eighties correctness.",literal
"Bcs is a journey I started this show when I was watching Breaking Bad and was expecting nothing but a deeper insight into the world of Saul and Gustavo etc. But then I got to know Jimmy McGill, got to know his story and new characters like Kim and Nacho. I started watching them live in this world, not Walter Whites world, but another maybe even more interesting and fascinating one. And they really grew onto my heart. And every scene is thought through and every character is put into their perfect place and everything makes sense. And in the end, we didn't just see why Saul became Saul, we saw Jimmy coming through and we saw him come back. We could not only see Jimmy become Saul Goodman, but also him coming from underneath and now, when I rewatch Breaking Bad, I can see or at least imagine Jimmy lying underneath Sauls fassade. It just fulfilled Saul Goodmans purpose, makes him whole. I love the show, I love the stories, I love everything about it.",figurative

"every element is entertainment There is simply nothing about NCIS that is not to like. I'll get the superficial stuff out of the way first - every camera angle on Michael Weatherly is gorgeous, and he plays it so well as Anthony DiNozzo. Ziva, his partner, is most adorable with every cultural nuance she utters as she tries to grasp American idioms. It's charming and realistic. Her ability to speak Israeli for some plot lines truly adds to her beauty and character-balancing the serious with the humorous sides of the show. Bringing David McCallum into our lives again brings the emotion of nostalgia. How we loved his British accent in THE MAN FOR U.N.C.L.E. His charming ramblings, his sensitivity to forensics, and his educational lessons are perfect. Characters McGee and Abby play perfectly off each other. and Mark Harmon is the guiding treasure. Tie up in a bow, and they have all played their characters so convincingly that we are invited to be part of their team every week. That's true TV.

"Amazing Wednesday I love the show in general. Jenna Ortega did an amazing job on making her Wednesday intimidating, scary and adore at the same time. My only advice would be that she talked a bit too fast. What was great about Christina Ricci's Wednesday was that she talked more slowly and it really makes her Wednesday more scary. However, Jenna's Wednesday glare definitely beats Christina's Wednesday glare.

The setting was great too, perfectly captured what you would expect in the Addam's Family universe and how you would expect Wednesday to behave when she is with other girls her age. I do hope this show can get more seasons and more mysteries.",literal
"Tried to watch I really tried but sorry, this was absolute trash. While I would say individual performances by some of the younger actors were great - good to see talent from other places like Canada, Toronto - the lead actor was just robotic, unnatural and didn't play the role effectively.

In the end, Netflix is going to have to come to terms with the following: we all have a limited lifespan on this planet, and if you expect us to waste our ""life"" on ""series"" they have to be good, not garbage.

To all the defenders on the lead actor - please stop. It's easy to say when someone is bad while you cower under the umbrella of titles and slogans.

If you want to manufacture themes that broader society should accept, do them right. Otherwise, it's just a wasted effort.

Ending was bad and it dragged so badly within the first 1-5 episodes.",figurative
"Hooked After Two Episodes of St. Denis Medical! After just two episodes, St. Denis Medical has already won me over. The mockumentary format really brings the characters to life, and as a fan of the genre, I'm thrilled to see how each character is given their moment to shine. Each personality feels distinctive and well-rounded, which is essential in a show like this where comedy comes not just from situations but from the unique quirks and reactions of each character.

I was especially drawn to Allison Tolman's performance. Having admired her work in Fargo, where she delivered an unforgettable role, it's exciting to see her bring a fresh take to a comedic character in St. Denis Medical. Her blend of subtle humor and authenticity is spot on.

As for my favorite characters, Ron, Matt, and Bruce stand out for their personalities and interactions. I'm really excited to see how their arcs will develop in upcoming episodes. If the show continues at this pace, I hope we get many more seasons to explore these characters and their stories.

Overall, St. Denis Medical feels like a perfect balance of humor and heart, and I can't wait to see what's next!",figurative

"Family can be rough, as Trier reminds us To rebuild or not to rebuild with one's father? That is the question of this exquisite and layered film from Joachim Trier. An accomplished Norwegian theatre actress has her life upended when her estranged father, a storied but aging director comes knocking trying to get back into her life. Much to her surprise, her father unapologetically asks her to star in a film that is his new passion project and one that hits close to home. Disgusted, she rebuffs him but the winding road to the next chapter merely begins.

Renate Reinsve plays much the same type of protagonist as she did in ""The Worst Person in the World"", an intelligent woman with seemingly boundless potential but who deep down is utterly adrift. Her struggles are constant and acute here. Stellan Skarsgård is ideal as a father whose brief tenderness is drowned out by a mountainous ego powered by solipsism and vanity that does most of the talking. As a father, he naively believes that one quick fix/miracle cure can erase or nullify a failed legacy as a parent. Elle Fanning is the Hollywood starlet who briefly becomes the director's new muse. Her star power is a fleeting phenomenon as she quickly begins to stumble with the role she takes on for him. Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas is exceptional as the more reserved but more grown-up sister. In fact, everyone in this film is superb.

The film often blurs the line between real life and artistic performance, recognizing the sustenance that performances derive from the emotional wounds one walks around with. The film seldom raises its volume; watershed moments are usually conveyed with minimal histrionics. Trier doesn't pretend to have all the answers, but his film bravely tackles the rugged terrain of difficult parent-child relationships, the emotional minefield they can be and the sliver of hope that emerges from family scars. For patient viewers and those who can keep their feelings in check, this is quite rewarding and grandly recommended.",literal
"Slow Moving Character Development could have been better I felt the moving dragging. Keke Palmer was the only one who drew me to like her. The others were bleh! Not bad, but not endearing.

Maybe to put a little more drama in it, you could have put a time limit on trading places, and if it exceeds that, then the switch is permanent.

Of course, we have a huge problem with homelessness and wages. Many of the good-paying jobs have left our country.",literal

"Best thing on Netflix for ages This was the best show I've seen for a long time. Lots of twists and turns, keeps you guessing until the very end. Acting was brilliant but the stand out has to be Claire Danes she is brilliant. The short series is very suspenseful and keeps you on the edge of your lounge chair. Finally something worth watching on Netflix.",literal
"For Psychology Nerds. Are you, guys, interested in psychology by any chance? If your answer is yes, then you should definitely see this one. No, seriously. The psychology. That's what this show is all about. And that's why people who don't know a thing about it will miss the whole point. Despite the fact that the story here comes with a lot of twists, this mini-series is all about the details. Every character here comes with a very specific psychological profile, and very often we're supposed to figure their thoughts out just by following their face expressions.

Which... may actually be a problem, since the cast here... well, I can't say they're terrible, but most of them clearly not good enough to do the idea justice. Sarah Snook, for example, desperately needs more than one shocked expression. I mean, she did fine, but she needs more... How should I put it? Layers. Like I said, though, it's not really that bad. Things are holding, and it is possible to understand what the idea was. In other words, acting-wise it's fine, but it can be much, much better. Actually, you know what? What we have here is exactly what they call ""the TV level of acting"". It's just enough for a streaming show. No more, no less.

And it's the same thing about the story. When you look back at it? It's rather stupid. Cheesy even, especially since it was designed as something dead serious. Also, it comes with a pretty big plot hole. Well, it's not really a full-scale plot hole; it's just they've forgot to explain the details about one certain character's main motivation, thanks to which you'll sit there, asking yourself, ""Why didn't she just go to the police?!"" It is easy to come up with a logical answer, but let's be honest, when you start thinking about why things happened the way they did, it means something's wrong with the script. Well, not always. Certain kinds of fiction make use of that effect and make it, like, the main point, but not in this case.

The story here is designed not for deep thinkers. Again, it's a very ""TV"" thing. It makes you hooked instantly, and every single episode makes you want to know what happens next. You keep doing the ""One more episode and I'm going to sleep!"" thing until it's morning and you've binge-watched the whole thing. No, seriously, I'm not saying that just to give you an idea; that's exactly what happened to me. And I'm not really that easy to impress. In other words, it's streaming at its best.

OK, that came out a bit wrong. What I'm trying to say is that it's not, like, the best show in the world. It's good, sure, but it's not that. It's just... It makes you care, OK? You know how in pro wrestling it's considered a failure not when fans start to hate you, but when nobody in the audience cares about you? In a way, it's the same thing with streaming. ""I dunno, it was meh, I'll finish it sometime later""-that's how failure looks. All Her Fault is the opposite of that. By doing twists smartly and having a heck of a lot of those, it... Like I said, it's binge-watching material.

It also has a mystery element, and it does the mystery right. Ask yourself - what's a good mystery? Not like there's the only one correct answer or something, but to me, the good mystery is the one where you have all the clues to solve it before the main character. Those clues should be smart, of course, without making things too easy for you (because nobody likes mysteries in which you can guess the ending right away; it makes things boring), but they should be there. And again, All Her Fault nails it. Clues are there, but thanks to all the red herrings, it's quite hard to guess how things really are.

Like I said, though, the most interesting thing here is how psychological profiles work. The detective behind the investigation here calls the main characters ""good people"". But the thing is - the more you learn about them, the less you feel that way. It's just that, we all wear masks. And all of those happy families you see around you? There's a big chance it's all just an act. Things may be extremely complicated for them, and heck, those people may not be happy at all, just putting on an act for society. Or even for themselves. Because lying to yourself is a thing, too. That's what the show deals with. And putting such people against a character who's designed to look crazy at first? What can I say, it was smart.

So yeah. Really nice show. Totally recommend it. Just keep its nature in mind. Because if you won't, you'll risk judging it for things it should not be judged for. Thankfully, modern society is much more educated, and having more than one layer should not be a problem, but still, I think it was an important thing to mention. Dixi.",literal
"Perfect Summer Movie I got a pass to see XXX. I was going to pay to see it, so I was glad I got the pass. Going into it, I expected a big, loud, dumb action movie with more style than substance. I was right, and the movie was quite entertaining thanks to the great humour involved. That's where the problem lies: were they trying to be funny with the ludicrous stunts and cheesy one-liners (i.e. was this a well-done spoof of the spy genre)? Or was it actually trying to be a good movie, that happened to be so stupid it was funny? You can see how that line can be kind of blurry, but I'm willing to give the filmmakers the benefit of the doubt. So, if you're just another moviegoer, expecting nothing more than thrills, chills, spills and kills, XXX is the perfect summer movie. Expect nothing more. 7/10",literal
"Superman - A Spoiler Free Review - 11 July 2025 Superman - A Spoiler free review

After waiting for so long to see this I was apprehensive and excited at the same time. I think I knew what was coming but didnt want to believe it as I enjoyed Creature Commandos.

The casting looked pretty solid, good acting, lots of DC references to find and identify throughout.

Special effects to show Superman in his glory...what could go wrong you ask?

Well....... James Gunn has taken us down a pretty complicated tour of his idea of the new 52 style Superman in a way I hadn't really imagined possible which does entertain....however a mish mash of concepts follow as if he threw a load of DC characters on a noticeboard and then just threw it in a massive blender and this is what we get.

Zero character building on hardly anyone as they all seem to get one or two full scenes the entire film that hardly make an impact.

Annoying camera angles that see someone's arm and shoulder in parts of shots obscuring the view which happened so frequently it was starting to chafe my eyes.

Mister Terrific appears far too much, so much infact I was starting to think it was his film rather than Superman's.

I never thought I would see a Superman film and think to myself Clark Kent didnt appear enough, so that was a new one on me too.

Casting was pretty decent but Lex Luthor seemed far too young for someone who had been studying Superman for years.

I still believe a man can fly, and David Corenswet did make a decent Superman, but not the best iteration we have seen in my opinion. Perhaps James Gunn is trying to sabotage the new DCU before it even lifts off? Time will tell.

I wanted to love this more than I did, but its a mediocre 6/10 from me.",literal
"She Franken me til I Stein Guillermo Del Toro has done it again, pulling off a half decent movie. The acting, soundtrack, and cinematography are really on show. Really feels like a return to form after some recent Del Toro flops. Also, very solid cast with a caveat of Mia goth's performance being a tad bit stiff.

Spoilers: Very much appreciated how true it stayed to the novel.",literal
"Hope it gets a S2 Chad Powers was great-engaging, entertaining, and it kept me hooked every week. The characters were fun, the story had great momentum, and I was always excited for the next episode. My only complaint is that the episodes and the entire season were far too short! I couldn't believe episode 6 was the finale. Hopefully it gets renewed soon with a longer, fuller second season.",literal
"Hawaii was SO much better I was devastated they cancelled Hawaii, but I was hopeful for Origins. However, 6 episodes in and I am just not getting it. I love the whole franchise, but honestly this falls so SO short of the mark.

I can't quite place my finger on why I just don't like it. Everything just seems ... wrong. As much as Austin is a good actor, he just doesn't seem to fit the mould of Gibbs very well. And, sure, the Shannon-Kelly storyline is important, but there's way too much emphasis placed on it.

This recent episode was ALL about Lala and we still know nothing about why she is like she is. Everything is so hazy and annoying. Like, stop beating about the bush and SAY WHAT YOU NEED TO SAY!

Please consider cancelling this rubbish in favour of bringing back Hawaii!! PLEASE!!",literal
"Painfully Unimaginative This movie is so unimaginatively silly that it feels stuck on the level of a mid-90s Power Rangers episode.

"Reviews from another cultural perspective As a Chinese person, I really enjoy medieval European dramas; some characters based on popular historical stories, such as Robin Hood, are still quite well-known. But I was quite shocked when I saw that the character of Little John was Black, as it didn't match my understanding of history, even though it seems this show doesn't aim for historical accuracy.

In Chinese culture, figures who rebel against authoritarian rule always leave a lasting impression and earn respect. Throughout thousands of years of history, with the changing dynasties, such figures have always been present. This is why I like Robin Hood; we enjoy seeing such characters grow and change history. However, the first few episodes made me drowsy; the character development was weak, and the romance was also underdeveloped. The actors were very beautiful, which was the only thing keeping me watching.",literal
"They didn't come up with all verdicts... Actor Russel Crowe acting was very good, as well as actor Rami Malek but I was very surprised that only Hermann Goring's verdict was heard... Why not all others 21 indicted war criminals? At one point they were about to tell Rudolf Hess' verdict and they stopped short... The rest of the movie was amazing!",literal
"Why would you ruin a cast like this by making Kim the frontrunner? Kimmy is not an actress. Period. All's Fair? More like All's possible when you are uber wealthy, which is not in fact fair. I don't get how a cast like this was assembled knowing that the show could never be taken seriously with Kimmy at the helm. One must assume that hopes, and paychecks, were very high. Kim, if you want to take this seriously, take the needed time and effort to improve and strengthen your acting chops. You pulled down something that could have actually been decent. What a shame.",literal
"Excellent Show Wife and I are really enjoying this show. Went into it with no expectations but I like Glen Powell and he really does a great job in this role. I really love college football too so that helps.

Hope they do more seasons of the show. It's like an American version of Ted Lasso in a way with Glen Powell's character arc. There are hilarious moments, there are serious / sad moments where you really feel for the characters.

If any Hulu execs are reading this, put the show up for sale on blu ray or somewhere like Vudu so I can buy a copy of it to support the show.",literal
"Awesome I absolutely loved Eli's version A-lot!!! This show is awesome, can't stop laughing!!! Watched all 5 episodes so far, Glen Powell is freakin hilarious.

"Fantastically written and complex What an amazing series. From the storytelling to the nuanced humor, the story of Mark and his life both in and out of work are both captivating and full of drama/suspense. A show worthy of being watched, I am glad I watched thru a second time with my wife as I had missed some parts when I orginally watched alone. It is a slow build up at first with the mundane walk thrus of Mark's ""job"" but the story develops wonderfully into something that encapsulates your attention and keeps you wanting more. Great cast of characters!",literal
"Best film I've seen for a long time I had seen the trailer for this and knew it involved some swashbuckling martial arts stuff, but knew nothing else about it. I expected it to be good, and it was definitely better than I expected!

I thought the film might be dubbed so I was pleased when it was subtitled. It is SO much better to see a picture in its original language. Dubbing absolutely ruins it for me most of the time. I am also interested in French, having studied it, so the whole despotic aristocratic thing really worked for me. People will criticize this film for having ""boring"" dialogue and lengthy filler scenes. Not a bit of it. If you view it as ""just a horror film"" then you might well be waiting for the next bit of action, but if you see it in a wider historical context I think the dialogue scenes work well.

I found it gripping right from the opening scene - the setting was so atmospheric. It was also graphic in the sense that it showed very realistic looking dead bodies and so on.

The scenes where the beast stalked people worked INCREDIBLY well in my opinion. You really empathise with the prey. I particularly liked the bit where the beast chased the child into the rabbit hole - great cinematography.

Most of this film was superb, but there were a few daft elements that shouldn't have been there IMO. The whole beast thing actually worked for me by the end; the one thing that really didn't was the climatic fight at the end. That sword was just silly, and so was the fact that men were crashing through boulders - why??? Oh well, it was still good action.

I will see this film again, and maybe even again. Superb.",literal
"S1 perfect, S2 okay, S3 uhm, S4 bye! I really liked this show at first. Huge Nathan Fillion fan since I first saw him on Buffy, and he never disappoints. His support cast is also mostly excellent, leading mid-40's LAPD recruit John Nolan through his personal crucible.

However, the longer the show goes on, the less of a rookie John Nolan becomes. Eventually he is elected Union Representative or something. At that point the show loses its identity, funny as the election campaign against Smitty may have been.

They completely lost me in season 4 with the ""wrongly accused"" plot. The idea is interesting, but the character involved is so unlikable that I was rooting for him to fail at life and everything. I just wanted the garbage to end.

TL;DR: Season 1-3 watchable, season 4 was my last.

Sorry Nathan.",literal
"First season(s) an 8. Last season just doesn't do it First season an 8. Great show. Really enjoyed, good for teenagers but also adults. Last season just doesn't do it, either waited too long to release the new season that I forgot what I liked about this show and just can't get into it or season 2 just kind of sucks. Gory zombies, seems more visual silly stunts than smarts.",literal
"It makes much more sense the second time watching. On the very verge of being a total flop with ludicrous heroism, childish taste, and grandiose way of delivering the message. However, the table turns at the very last 20 minutes. I see so many holes in the storyline and have hard time connecting each segment of plot, but the ending fills all the leaps of logic. Great pleasure for eyes - car chase, action, and especially magic show. Jesse Eisenberg's acting is disappointing while other actors do their parts right. He will always be Mark Zuckerberg with his monotone delivery and redundant style of performance.",literal
"Way too much message Who ever will see first 5 minutes of the movie will understand :). The review has to contain at least 300 words, what if i will tell that i felt un-ease from the start of the movie, what if i tell that i have expected relax and entertainment from this movie? None if these have been delivered, none. Money waist.",literal
"One-dimensional action film Paul Michael Glaser turned this futuristic thriller from the pen of Richard Bachman (alias Stephen King) into a silly, imminently forgettable action film. Steven E. De Souza's screenplay has but one purpose, and that is to cash in on muscle bound Schwarzenegger's rising star.

Arnie plays framed ex-cop Ben Richards, who is forced to participate in the 21st century's most popular game show, a sadistic man hunt which sees its ""runner"", or victim, forced to flee for his of her life from a group of very nasty ""stalkers"".

Arnie's body passes the test of course, but the rest of this movie (which had a promising premise) is destroyed by some ordinary action sequences and an awful sense of humour. Schwarzenegger's one-liners are dreadfully painful.

A real run of the mill, one-dimensional action film which delivers very little entertainment.

"AMAZING Absolute blast of a show. It's fun, entertaining, gory, combines satire with drama when approaching serious matters and subjects, part of its often intricate plot and story, based on what can be described ""simple"" premise, or basic set-up. Also can be goofy, not too goofy, and not too often, even though in rare occasions approaches too close to too goofy, what is my only minor complaint.

Overall it is great, and hopefully will continue like that, and when and where can, get better and better.",literal
"Getting really bad This show is getting increasingly pathetic. It is pure torture to watch. How could they replace characters like Ducky and Abby with such weak, inadequate characters like Jimmy and Kasie? And then there is Mr. Macho Torres. A major network like CBS should not promote such stereotypical, repulsive characters like Torres? Even McGee's character has been watered done and is colourless. Pathetic really is the best way to describe how this series has progressed. Time to stop the series. Or bring back Gibbs, Ducky and Abby, which of course is unlikely. Even DeNozzo was better than any of the new characters.",literal
"An example I absolutely loved the first season and thought that, just like many other shows, it would get bad with each new season. This show is so good that the writing in each season is just as good as the previous seasons or gets even better and that's something that few shows can say.

For me it's one of my favorite shows at the moment and I love how they bring out new characters and story lines with each season aside from 1 or 2 recurring (season 2 and 3 example).

This show is truly the pinnacle of excellence when it comes to writing and acting and the fact that production 10/10 doesn't hurt either.

If I would ever create a show, this show would be the example I would use.

Keep it up writers and actors!",literal

I loved EVERYTHING in this movie, from the characters, to the animations like it was edited in a very funny anime style way sometimes, and THE SONGS. AMAZING. Loved the vocals, and the lyrics really resonated with me. I also liked how the main characters in the movies had such different personalities and could still be friends like their unique personalities really shone through this movie. The ending broke me though 😭. I really hope there will be a sequel because there really is a lot of potential for this world to grow and expand.",figurative

"So full of tired old cliches and formulas. Lazy writing. I love the concept. And I do really like Molly Parker and I really like her acting here.

However, the writing is just juvenile. It's as if the person writing it grew up watching shows and didn't realize they weren't real. So, they just continued the same tired old lazy writing we've seen in other mediocre (or worse) shows. I tend to forgive this a little more if it's a formulaic show and they put out a large number of episodes per year. But this doesn't seem to be that. (There are only 10 episodes on Netflix. So, I expect movie quality.)

I can't believe the high ratings.

* It's 2025, but they are using the same tired old medical inaccuracies that we all now know are inaccurate. So lazy.

* Pretty terrible dialog. Example: Someone yells ""Someone get a doctor!"" Is this the 1940s? Nobody yells that. They yell, ""Call 911"" or possibly if they are older, ""Get an ambulance!"" * The super cliche old couple that picks on each other in a ""cute"" way. There might be such couples, but you have to write them as if they are real people to not come across as lazy.

* The good friend who is selfless and has zero personality, because the main character doesn't care about the friend AT ALL, never does anything for them. Everything is about the main character in that interaction. And the friend never complains. (Again, I love the actress who played her.) * They portray unethical behavior as if it's heroic. (A common trope in medical, detective, and copy shows.) One example is joking about violating HIPPA.

* Who would go to a hospital that only had one good doctor? I hate cop and medical shows where everyone is incompetent except the main character, who is unprofessional and unethical.",literal
"Wonderful acting by the whole cast! Not knowing anything about President Garfield, I came to this series because of the calibre of the cast having read up about this - and they did not disappoint! What a great and moving story this was - portraying Garfield as a decent, loving family man and a President determined to do well, but unfortunate enough to attract the obsessive attention of an inadequate and attention-seeking individual named Charles Guiteau.

I cannot fault the cast of superb actors such as the wonderful Michael Shannon, Bradley Whitford, Shea Wigham and others not previously known to me, such as Nick Offerman and Betty Gilpin - who is beautiful and absolutely perfect in her role as Garfield's loving wife.

Matthew Macfadyen plays the increasingly deranged Guiteau incredibly well, gaining our sympathies at first but then becoming gradually more frightening as the level of his desperation and obsession grows.

I see plenty of Emmy nominations and hopefully some Awards coming for this superb piece of entertainment.",literal

"Dark Winds Complete S01 Review Set in 1971, the story revolves around the three Tribal Police officers, Joe Leaphorn (Zahn McClarnon), Jim Chee(Kiowa Gordon) and Bernadette Manuelito (Jessica Matten). Primarily we have two storylines going simultaneously. First, the investigation of a double murder of a young girl and an old man and the second one where the FBI is in search of the culprits behind a big heist and suspects that it's linked to a native American activist group.

It's quite intriguing how the show creates this dependency of both these departments on each other and how they constantly try to leverage the situation for their own good. The show successfully holds the suspense and keeps the tension high at times. It does a very good job of developing most of the characters and bringing distinctive personality traits out of them. Seeing the native American actors in the major roles makes it more believable and authentic. Another likeable aspect of this show is the representation of the Navajo cultural beliefs and traditions. I always find it interesting when a show tries something like this. Not very often but we do see the characters speaking in their native language which I personally liked. The supernatural aspect of the story does add an additional layer to the show although I found it a little overdone. The show never exactly dwells much into that subplot either until the finale. The moments of grief and self-realisation are handled effectively and one such specific moment does make us emotional.

The show lacks strong cliffhanger moments towards the end of each episode. It definitely gives True Detective vibes (one of the greatest crime investigation shows) but due to some minor issues never reaches that height. The activist organisation and events associated with them were not developed properly, especially their backstory and I found the end twist a little underwhelming. The finale turns out to be the shortest episode of the season and I expected more action and thrill from it. There are few subplots that never get an ending. Maybe they will continue them in the next season. These are the few things that in my opinion could have been improved.

Conclusion: As someone who craves crime shows and movies, Dark Winds definitely serves its purpose as an intriguing and well-made crime drama. The show handles the suspense, action and emotions in a balanced way. The cast performs extremely well. The Navajo traditions are the key highlight of the show. There are a few things that could have been done differently but none is a potential threat to our enjoyment. I enjoyed watching the 'Dark Winds' a lot.

Rating: 8.0/10

It would be interesting to see what a native American thinks of the show. If you have read the books, do you still find this show interesting or it was a disappointment for you?

Whatever your thoughts on this show, share them with me. You can find me on Instagram and Letterboxd: m_movie_reviews

BOOK VS SHOW Since I haven't read any of the books, I went online to find out how similar or different this show is from the books. I'll share a few important aspects of the show that are different from the books. The show didn't pick any specific plot from one book. It borrows different subplots from different books and combines them to create its own storyline. The personality traits of Leaphorn and Jim Chee have been interchanged. Manuelito is senior to Chee in the show and is a pre-established character in the show's timeline whereas the books do not introduce the character until 1996's ""The Fallen Man.""",literal
"Ridiculous. Recommended. Riot of fun. You have to suspend disbelief as you do in, say, any of the John Wick films. But this one actually has a plot! A fairly limited one but it isn't just a revenge flick, the character's motive is clear from the first 5 or so minutes. That the character is who he is becomes the driver of the movie.

If you don't like seeing evil Nazis killed in a variety of ways then this is not your film. If you do not view some films as pure escapism and expect documentary reality then this is not your film.

Otherwise, enjoy your tour through bleak northern Finland as the trail of bodies grows. I didn't know the cast but they perform well in their roles and the direction is taut and focused on... well, you'll see!

A solid 8 out of 10 for me; not necessarily awarded for moviemaking, but for sheer enjoyment in a movie.",literal
"Season 1 is a visual masterpiece, ""The Morning Show"" Season 1 is a visual masterpiece, especially during its depiction of the California wildfires. The imagery is breathtaking and adds a visceral intensity to the storyline. The portrayal of the two lead characters is nothing short of remarkable, with their complexities and dynamics driving the narrative forward. The series offers a captivating glimpse into the inner workings of a network, shedding light on the unseen machinations of the industry. It's a meticulously crafted show, evident in its high production values and attention to detail. With its palpable tension and engrossing storytelling, ""The Morning Show"" proves to be a riveting watch that leaves a lasting impression.",figurative
"Writing Ever since they let Thomas Gibson go the writing has significantly gone down. Wish he could have articulated and set a standard with out anger. He unfortunately, was correct. The writers left to own devices are not producing story lines that captures anyone's attention",literal
"Just dumb Don't believe the hype. This isn't a horror flick.think about how realistic movies like SAW are and you can maybe understand why I hated this movie. I'd even tried to avoid any discussion of the film. And was successful. But still found the premise of the movie unbelievable, unrealistic, and generally dull.",literal
"Moana Maui was one of the best modern Disney movies, and he was the undisputed best character in the movie The rock performance was excellent and was befitting the character and Moana's character was good, the comedy in the film was excellent The story of the film was very good The graphics and the design of the characters in the movie was great The songs of the film were beautiful.",literal
"Interesting Concept Poorly Done Anyone who has ever seen the original NCIS knows that Gibbs backstory was relatively well established throughout Mark Harmon's time on the show. Even his days as a probationary agent received attention on the original show. This show, however, seeks to reinvent that story somewhat and delve into his early days as an agent with what was then called NIS. All in all, this could be a good concept to follow and expand upon, but this production is poorly written, poorly acted and poorly cast. Whomever is in charge of sound on this program should be fired or replaced since quite often you cannot understand the dialogue. It is as though they are speaking in mumbles. The scripts veer from subject to subject, and are not easy to follow whatsoever, to point one doesn't really know what is going on and more importantly does not really care. Maybe it will improve, since it is early days and series need to grow into themselves. Indeed, the very first episode of the original series presented a vastly different Gibbs than the one who ultimately inhabited the series until Harmon's departure. All the NCIS tropes are to be found in this new series: the geeky agent, the eccentric lab tech, the sexy, yet tough female agent. The stories are nothing special, standard fair for NCIS through all its iterations. Both Mark Harmon and his son are listed as executive producers on the show and one would think that they could've influenced the casting choice of the younger Gibbs, but apparently that was not the case. The writers are presenting the young Gibbs as somewhat of a moronic silent type that gives no indication of any great investigative skill; at the moment it's hard to feel invested in the character. I do not blame the actors, after all, they can only work with what the script writers give them.",literal
"Absolutely loved this.....better be more seasons? Binge-watched all 10 episodes tonight in one sitting. Absolutely loved it. It's like a 5-h Rob Reiner or Nora Ephron romantic comedy full of romance, crackling dialogue and interesting characters. Kristen Bell and Adam Brody have real chemistry and the supporting characters add a lot. Hungry for so much more to see how their relationship develops, so I'm hoping a second season is already planned and more to come after that. I think it brings a humourous take on the Jewish religion and customs whilst always staying respectful. Was a little disappointed that the one reference to the Catholic religion was a negative one but as Tom Clancy once said, the only acceptable bigotry in society is against Catholics so have gotten used to it. Watch it!",literal

"Had high hopes, but it was a hot mess I really wanted to like this movie - I had high hopes. But the story is all over the place. It jumps between different storylines with no real flow, and none of it makes sense. It honestly feels like the director wanted to say something emotional but had no idea how, so they just mixed everything together into a mess.

The two young leads were great, but everything else fell flat.

As an Asian viewer, it was especially disappointing that the Asian male character was written as a complete stereotype. It feels like he was included just for the sake of diversity, instead of being treated like a real person. If you can't write, then don't write.",figurative
"Fillion strikes gold again! Was a bigger ""Castle"" fan than ""Firefly"", but so far ""The Rookie"" has been fantastic! Great character development and acting, interesting story lines and just enough action that each episode seems way too short. My only critique is that the two female officers look too much alike and I can't always tell them apart, but that could just be me. Really looking forward to the next episode. Bummer the whole season isn't released at once like Netflix. Highly recommend watching!",literal
"I'd dispute my credit card payment if I was a backer Gorgeous production, moody lighting, and eerie music set the tone for a promising start to Shelby Oaks. The slow, dialogue-heavy mockumentary setup builds tension well... but the movie completely derails, turning into an underwritten supernatural horror with zero payoff.

The film tries to avoid cliché exposition but ends up offering no real explanation for its supernatural chaos. You can't just strip away horror tropes without replacing them with coherent storytelling. Subversion isn't the same as subtraction.",literal
"Style Over Substance in the Worst Way Materialists tries to satirize the hollow nature of modern relationships, but ends up embodying the very superficiality it sets out to critique. The film hides behind shiny visuals and empty conversations, offering no emotional weight, no narrative drive, and certainly no characters worth caring about. For all its polished surface, it's disappointingly shallow-more concerned with looking clever than being meaningful. A sleek, soulless product mistaking cynicism for insight.",figurative
"Yet another procedural It always amazes me how many people watch these generic procedurals. I know I'm not the target audience, but basic cable keeps churning out these objectively bland shows that has no character development, no chemistry between romantic partners, sex is extremely cheap (girl cop falls into bed because he tells one sob story about his dead dad), and annoying plot holes that's waved away very easily. Lead guy always makes the right call (even if logically it doesn't make sense in real life), always partnered with a tech person that basically does half the job for said lead character. All while the music sounds like it's made by the same person across all 50 or so of these shows.",literal
"Better then expected Good pilot! Well excecuted first episode. Feels sometimes like an episode of SOUTHLAND which is good thing. Good acting, good designed action and interesting characters.",literal
"""Okay."" Not the best, but not the worst... I enjoyed the movie, but was left rather disappointed overall.

The movie starts off slow pace, but eventually picks up after a bit. The plot was descent: ""Rich guy hires gang of mercenaries to go on a government forbidden island and collect valuable Dino blood samples- they happily oblige for a price - in order for rich guy to sell blood samples to scientists to make a cure for heart disease; to which then he can patent and sell the cure to rich patients who have the money to afford it. Of course, all goes wrong shortly after they start their journey/mission.""

However, i genuinely feel like the movie would have been better if they left out the unnecessary side character family arch. While the mercenary team is out looking for the mosasaur, a father and his 2 daughters and boyfriend get stranded in the ocean due to the mosasaur and a few spinosaurs attacking their sail boat. They get rescued by the mercenary team after sending out a distress call, and then subsequently join them on their journey to the forbidden island. They get separated (as expected) and then the movie proceeds to switch back and forth between scenes of the mercenary team and scenes of the family while they both navigate the island. In my opinion- this was just not necessary. The addition of a random family as a secondary plot line to add more characters is just.....wasteful. That money could have gone toward better things like CGI... Their characters contributed very little significance and depth to the main storyline and it honestly felt like they were added into the script as filler. I would have preferred if the writers just stuck to a plot line that focused only on the mercenary team and their mission/navigating the island, and the trials and tribulations they'd have to endure while trying to collect Dino samples.",figurative
"It was a movie, I guess It didn't make a lick of sense, the addition of running in the world and the hunters being just dudes in camo and ski masks, the girl only exists for a minute around an hour and half into the movie... It was worse by far in every respect than the Arnie movie, it felt an hour too long, it was dumb rather than a romp or farcical l.

It was too silly to be serious, scenes were too long-winded to be fast-paced, the action existed and were fine for what they were, but it was too many plot points and too many subplots, and too many focus-shifting, the producer and host being different people was messy, and the last couple of scenes after the plane fight were moronic.

It just felt like a bunch of poor to average fight and action set pieces and the movie was just there to put them in order and give them an excuse to happen.

It wasn't fun, compelling or interesting at all, but it wasn't actively bad.",literal
"So much better than expected. This is a show that, given the topic, could've easily been phoned in. Which is why I was totally unprepared for the quality in all respects - writing, acting,...there's so much nuance and detail. They didn't have to make it excellent, but they did anyways. It's great to see that level of professionalism and care for the craft of storytelling.

Also, having spent most of my life in the south, including in the areas depicted here, it's incredible how well they nailed it. Jason Clarke's performance is unreal.",literal
"Dick Wolfe and/or NBC/Universal are major idiots What is the deal with NBC/Universal and/or Dick Wolf, cancel L & O for L & O LA, CA, the west coast mentality has always left me with a bad taste in my mouth, those Californians, especially southern Californians have never had a grasp of reality and that includes their criminal justice system, O.J. anyone? Granted L & Os story lines were getting pretty lame, not like the days of Jerry Orbach with his wise cracks, he brought humor to the show, he is sadly missed. I think they got to eliminate nonsense like the governor Connecticut making or breaking the career of the NYC DA, they have no such clout, that is unless there is some stupid law that allows Connecticut citizens to vote in NY County. My understanding is you can only be a citizen of 1 state at a time unless you have vehicle registration plates for 2 states and split your time and taxes evenly among those 2 states, highly improbable. To try to convince anyone that a governor of 1 state has influence over the affairs in another is not possible. I will admit that the appearance of some of the characters was pretty shabby, no 1 appreciates an unshaven typical jelly donut eating portrayal of an law enforcement officer. To be honest Sam Waterston wasfar more charismatic when he was ADA, loved to see him tear the defendants apart. Linus Roache in his role of ADA Cutter simply did not have the same killer instinct in him or the legal savvy of Jack McCoy. I have heard rumors that Law & Order might be returning, if so it is obvious Sam Waterston will not be playing the role of NYC DA.",literal
"Saying Farewell..... The rave reviews for this disaster must be from Kardashian devotees or those on the payroll. No self-respecting adult could find wisdom or value in this drivel. The writing is so mechanical, even ChatGPT would cringe to claim it. Characters are as shallow as a kiddie pool, storylines are TikTok snippets that fizzle faster than a bad meme, and the serious actors involved will be haunted by this fiasco forever.

And let's not forget how the show glamourises divorce, treating it like a reality TV spectacle rather than a family's emotional turmoil. Here's hoping this train-wreck never gets another season.

The only redeeming quality is the wardrobe designer for Naomi Watts, and I hope she kept the clothes because anything else will be a painful memory. The show's time jumps ensure you don't care or identify with these characters. It also emphasizes that money trumps all, with everything revolving around titles, prestige, or being married to sports stars-or divorcing them. Plus, there's no logical explanation for how they live like oligarchs after starting a ""boutique firm."" The camp it attempts to deliver feels like a pale imitation of Glee or Buffy, but those shows are genius, and this proves America's IQ is slipping.

I can't even say it's so bad you have to watch it, because you'll lose IQ points by engaging. Just avoid.",literal
"Its not a horror film. OK just lets get one thing out of the way. I have not seen the original TV series or any other production of this story. I also have not read the book so this is not one of those ""its not as good as the book or original moans"". Having just watched the movie I can say its definitely worth watching. Its a well enough made film with some great effects and acting. However I did find some of the kids dialogue inaudible and it seemed to be difficult to pick out what they were saying sometimes with too many voices at once. Another issue with the sound was the odd choice of music which did not seem to sit right with the actual scenes. There were a few comedic parts which did not really seem to hit the mark either. However what I will say is that the film just is not scary. There's no tension before any of the supposed frights, they are set up in a way that you see them coming a mile off and when they do you basically find yourself thinking, OK so the clowns here and its doing its cgi thing but no that was not a surprise and I did not get a fright. In the screening I was I did not see a single person react to any of the scares. That is the main problem with this movie. The posters and trailers sell the film as a scary horror, which it is not. Its like a mix of The Lost Boys and Stand By Me. I could see this movie having a PG rating if one or two scenes were removed, but these scenes do not involve the clown. If you are expecting a real horror film or something closer to the book you may be disappointed. But go in with an open mind and you will probably enjoy it. Its an adventure movie not a horror.",figurative
"Potential to spare A long awaited pilot that delivered exactly to the fans what was promised. I greatly enjoyed the pilot and I feel that while some of the animation is a bit choppy, there is great potential and I feel that as more is made the animation will become smoother and better. I am very excited for the next episode.",literal
"A flawed work with numerous treats Brotherhood of the Wolf will most likely play better in general to audiences who understand French than those who don't since this is indeed a foreign-language film, but for those English speaking folks or other, here are my words on this new film.

Wolf tells the story (partially on fact) of a beast who prowled the landscape in the mountains and closer in France in 1764, and of the people who were sent to hunt it down.  But for the few most determined of these hunters, they discover that this wolf-monster goes deeper than expected. The film drags too often and while it kicks up good momentum enough at times to keep even the most drowsy at attention, I was hoping for more.  This film which gained French and worldwide acclaim is overlong and overdone in parts where it doesn't need it (do I have to see slow motion used in some form in every fight or action scene), but it gets the grade given since it is an entertaining and exhilarating experience that should make up for the lulls for some more or less than others.  Great design on the beast by the way. B+",literal
"BRILLIANT!!! The only show on T.V. worth watching in a sea of bad. Great acting, excellent music, intriguing storylines, and even hilarious situations are combined with HBO's no-holds-barred content. James Gandolfini is mesmerizing as Tony Soprano, a lynchpin in the Italian Mafia. However, instead of seeing Tony as just a one-dimensional thug, we see that he has a life outside of his criminal activities, and that's what makes this show different from it's competition. It's a different side to the story of criminals, that they have normal lives when not breaking the law. The entire supporting cast is brilliant, especially Edie Falco, as Tony's wife Carmela, a deeply religious woman who stands behind her man despite all of his sins and Lorraine Bracco, as Dr. Jennifer Merlhi, Tony's psychiatrist; a woman who fears him when she is giving him therapy, but secretly is attracted to him when they're apart. This is indeed ""the show that revolutionized T.V."" See it!!!",literal
"best anime This is the best anime I've seen in three years. At first I was not a fan of this dragon-ball looking style characters, but after watching 5 episodes I have to say one punch man is awesome... Its music and scenes are great, and the best part about one punch is that Saitama is so funny and powerful, but he himself does not know. I love Genos aw he's so cute >w< OPM is expressing an extremely positive and heroic feeling, it makes me think of things I really want to do and who I really am. Sometimes a childish dream is not just a joke. With belief and hard work, we can all become master Saitama, the strongest man in the world :)",literal
"IT was brilliant but not a horror its more a comedy this movie was brilliant really enjoyed it, although I thought it would be a horror movie it was more of a comedy, we laughed almost all the way through. Its well worth a watch the acting is superb and I found it to be much better than the first movie, just a shame it weren't scary as we thought it would be, overall id give a 9 out of 10 but think the rating should be a PG :)",literal
"Not Robin of Sherwood There are so many Robin Hood movies and tv series, but I always compare them to the ultimate one: the '80's series Robin of Sherwood. That one was pure magic, thanks to the script writing, the actors, the character development, the two Robins (one played by Sean Connery's son btw), and of course the mindbogglingly mesmerizing music from Clannad.

But this.. the only thing it had speaking for it before I started watching was Sean Bean. He couldn't pull this off though. Not with this bad generic script writing, mediocre talent, no interesting character development whatsoever, an unenigmatic Robin and fakish forest music and boring lightning. Nice tried, but I'd recommend everybody to go look for Robin of Sherwood. Now THAT was magic.",literal
"Great Show I happened to come across this show because of a marathon airing on Canada's movie channel and I must say this show is fabulous. Cathy a character you cannot help but fall in love with. Her character gives you hope and lets you see the lighter part of hard situation. I love how she's involved in the aspect of everyone's life and how she's such a caring woman even though she has her own problems. It shows the different emotions of various characters. 

This show is well written, cannot wait to see whats in store for next season. This show will make you laugh and will make you cry. Definitely worth watching.",literal
"Alcohol commercial.. Good movie, a bit slow at times but overall entertaining but again, too many scenes with ""booze = feel good"" sequences. Morning, day, evening, feel bad? Just drink some strong alcohol and hop voila. It's typical of so many movies that it makes you wonder who pushes the scenarii in this kind of direction..",literal
"Don't trust the media I'm still here !!

Ben Richard's enters the Running Man competition to generate lifetime wealth to support his family who are bottom of the barrel poor. He has 30 days to survive or take out all 5 hunters. In a world where everyone is after you and has access to technology it's hard to live off the grid.

It's a solid movie for the most Larry I actually really enjoyed it. The acting is good, Glen Powel is very entertaining as the lead, decent character ""growth"" and good action. The decision making of a character was also good for once.

The movie kind lost legs in the last half hour, the overall theme is don't trust the media and 100% I'm behind that but with the characters who get involved and how they act the message seems to be aimed in then backing and trusting a part of society who are the complete opposite yet deranged in their own way and honestly they left a bad taste in my mouth and at the end aswel.

Trying to push that aside, maybe shave off 10 minutes and it's sweet, I liked it, 7.5/10.",literal
"Please skip this one First of all,the main theme in this serie is the villain. That's the name of the tv show. But the villain in question is such a bad actor that it feels painful to watch. I can't believe who is in charge of the casting or maybe he puts a lot of money,otherwise there is no explanation.

The plot is not realistic, but I think if the producers skips Jack Whitehall probably it would have been at least watchable.",literal
"Watson Watson reminds me of Sherlock and house, but it's not as crazy as house MD and not as quirky as Sherlock and those shows got great ratings and they were unrealistic, but this show Watson the lead actor does a good job in the cast so I gave it a seven because it is entertaining. I can't wait until the cast members reveal themselves one by one and the mystery of Moriarty just like in Sherlock. He was trying to find him too. This is the reason why I like this show because some of the stuff they diagnose I look them up and it's true of the symptoms think also that the writers are doing a good job so far in each episode to make it interesting to watch.",literal
"It took a second viewing in 2020... To give this WONDERFUL sitcom a 10 out of 10. I'd watched it on and off many times throughout the years, but it wasn't until they put it in Amazon Prime Video early this year that I watched it in its entirety. For whatever reason, in my first viewing (yes, I watched all 12 seasons TWICE this year), I felt that the series went completely downhill from seasons six and seven and then picked up again the last season, culminating in an EXTREMELY good final speech by Sheldon at the end. But this second time around, I was waiting, expecting it to get bad in season six... and then in seven, in eight, then nine, ten, eleven. And NOTHING. I loved it from beginning to end, and I'm SO GLAD I watched the entire thing again at the end of this strange 2020 that we've all been living through. An outstanding series from beginning to end, well worth your time... even twice in the same year!",literal
"Overall awesome. Weak ending, unfortunately. I thought this was great. I was entertained nonstop. The beginning being particularly enthralling. Toni Collette, Isolde Ardies, and Sarah Gadon all acted phenomenally. Their characters were layered and intense.

The ending was a bit lacking, in my opinion. It seemed like the final two episodes made everything less cohesive and for that, I'm notably disappointed. This went from 'potential masterpiece' to just 'solid entertainment'.

It reminded me a bit of the recent novel The Reformatory. I do recommend.

Just as a side note: I do also think these wildly varying reviews are largely due to people's strong opinions on the trans casting. I'll say, I don't think the role was well-cast, but I don't think it was poorly-acted.",figurative
"Wonderful revelation I must admit that, as a cheater viewer who has a deep and abiding affection for Ted Dawson, the mere sight of the poster excited and delighted me. Uncovering the creator veil and realizing that it was Michael Schur, I immediately knew that this would be a small, cozy masterpiece. Ending the last episode with sadness, expecting more beautiful scenes and inspiring dialogues, I realized that the series will probably have a continuation.

Aside from that, this new series comes as quite a surprise. With a notable number of Hollywood legends led by Ted Dawson, this wonderful project reminded us what a unique family TV show looks like. Every scene is carefully crafted. This is not just a classic ""whodunnit"" show; in addition, this is a relaxing, emotional, and extremely entertaining program. I recommend everyone immerse themselves in the story and enjoy the marvelous play and excellent acting.",figurative
"Bad Bad Bad So, here comes another tobacco commercial. Let some people smoke to a bad script, call it a comedy, throw in some virtue signaling, get some semi known actors, and a lot of money.

"unique concept bad pacing You might think i am a contrarian giving this show a 6 especially after reading the other reviews but just bear with me. This show is very slow but i was expecting that when i started it, the problem is that there was no payoff for it, the show starts off slow but at the end of the 1st episode you think it will pick up pace from the next episode but the story never starts flowing at the right speed. Episodes 2-6 have very few important plot advancements. At least 1 plot point has no significance to the overall story. Irving is an exceptionally dull and boring character. A 9 episode series did not need as many filler episodes as severance seems to have. I watched every episode patiently because of the amazing reviews i read about this show but even the end wasnt paced right the last episode was trying to fit in too many things. And after all that there still was no satisfying conclusion to the story just a half hearted cliffhanger end to warrant a 2nd season. This is not the revolutionary 10/10 show that the reviewers will have you believe it is. It feels as if i was robbed of the time it took to watch these 9 episodes. Also there is symbolism and i got that but it felt as if the whole show was just symbolism and had no concrete storyline. Such a waste of time.",literal
"Great basics, could have been even better. You can tell that Netflix spent big on this mini series. Costumes and settings are flawless. So is the impressive cast. Whitford is like a fish in the water, in this scenario. Matthew Macfadyen pretty much repeats his outstanding role from Succession, with both characters having so much in common.

I only wish they'd have given everything more depth. Another two episodes to get to know characters better, to explore the political background better. Ironically I feel that Garfield, out of all characters, wasn't done enough justice.",figurative

Glad we did give it a chance, it is starting to come good with character development and less jarring visual transitions between characters talking on the phone. The ensemble is good, characters are respectful and its nice to see authentic first aid every episode. In a few years, the historic context this fits in will reflect neighbours pulling away, fees required to help someone out and cops spread too thin but also too proud to take help. We are looking forward to season 3.",literal
"Not sure who the audience force this show is? Having recently reread the 1980's iconic book ""Class"" by Paul Fussell, I'm probably looking at this series through a different perspective than most viewers. Upper class is very mysterious, uncomfortable, and boring to most people, whereas upper middle class is more visible, relatable, and fun, which makes it somewhat confusing to understand why Maxine, this middle or lower middle class character wants to get into Palm Beach high society and why her husband who rejected the Palm Beach society he grew up around is tolerating his wife's agenda which is pulling him back from a place literally and figuratively he willingly ran away from.

I only watched the first 3 episodes, but already I can see that she really doesn't understand what she is getting herself into and disappointment probably is just around the corner. But that might just be the fun part of this ride through the perplexing American social class structure of social climbing wannabes and gatekeepers.

"Not sure this is going anywhere, but willing to wait Gilligan is everyone's favorite creator. With the ""Breaking Bad"" he was able to make the show attractive to all sorts of viewers - the moms and dads, the hip crowd, the liberals, the radicals, etc. It had a strong plot, great characters, it was edgy enough for the cinemaphiles but also acceptable enough to be suitable for a family viewing with your teenage children.

""Better Call Saul"" was more of the same, although for my taste it was too much of a slowburner and the plot was somewhat pedestrian, getting further into the bland and banal territory of network television. But it did enjoy mainstream popularity, and cemented Gilligan's reputation in the eyes of the mainstream viewers.

This new show is going to be a watershed moment of sorts - will it manage to satisfy both the mainstream and the cinemaphile viewers, or it will go even more in the direction of mainstream?

Based on the two episodes I've watched, I am on the fence about that. The premise is interesting, especially for those that don't read a lot of sci-fi. It's also on the face of it a utopia with nowhere left to go - an annoying main character not accepting the better world - poses almost zero conflicts and the grand idea being revealed by the third act of the first episode leaves almost no chance for it to be surpassed or even matched by anything else in the upcoming episodes. Or so it seems.

The second episode already shifts gears and crawls through, using the same idea from the first episode to provide some conflict or drama. Is it all downhill from this then? Frankly speaking - it looks like it, but it's definitely possible that Gilligan does have a few tricks up his sleeve, and Breaking Bad was not a fluke.

I will give him the benefit of a doubt and hopefully this will get into this elusive territory of profound ideas, memorable characters and a great, unpredictable plot.",literal
"Extraordinary and Intelligent. As hard to believe as it might seem, this series is also 'fresh'. It is truly original - it hasn't been done before. Midway through the first episode, something else of significance occurs, and somehow the makers of this drama managed to convince the people who make the trailers not to include it - or even allude to it. I am only midway through the second episode, but I can already tell you that this is not similar to other shows or books in the spy/suspense genre. It is also somewhat refreshing, because it isn't dominated by the sort of paranoia that bedevils Australians and others. The writing is deft; plot and dialogue flow together seamlessly. The acting is very, very credible.",literal
"Dreadful I had hopes. Not real high hopes but this is the creative behind Mare of East Town. That was gritty but compelling. This show....what a mess. Apparently we have to have lead characters with fraught family lives. In ""Mare"" it was the dead son by suicide that haunted Mare. In Task, Tom, the FBI agent played with dramatic flair by Mark Ruffalo, has a son who committed a serious crime that strains the family. Tom appears to be a functioning alcoholic. It all drags the show down horribly.

We have a small crew of thieves robbing drug selling biker gangs. The task force Tom assembles - misfits in each their own way- are tasked to bust the crew.

This a bad show. The characters are uniformly unlikeable and quirky. The crew inexplicably become inept and stupid.

"A holiday must. Having been a true fan of the lampoons series before it went astray with banal titles of the last decade. This for me was the last true great in the series. Hughes has created Griswold fait accompli with a Christmas setting for our hapless working class hero. This film defines what Chevy Chase does best,and thats to be just himself and nothing less. The type of comedy here is certainly ""family"",but never suffers for its rating or toned down puns.Anything more crude or harsh would spoil what is perfect comedy. Chase brings his slapstick,clumsy by lovable Clark Griswold to life with every dry remark and sly retort. The finest display of this can be found near the films end,when he vents his disgust about his scrooge-like boss scrimping on the yearly bonus. Finally we have all the Griswold clan under one roof,and who better than cousin Eddie(Quaid)to sum up everything thats truly wrong about having relatives over during the holidays!!!!. You cant help but feel enormous sympathy for Clark and Ellen,enduring both sets of parents,as they torment each other with their little digs and snipes. An awesome comedy moment has to be Clarks grease assisted power sled scene with the make shift sled.Utter class A comedy for the whole family without loosing its grip.

I had such a great time watching this, the least I could do is to show my appreciation. The dynamic between the characters is what sets it all up. My personal favourite was the brother, hysterically funny and just authentic.

At some points I was afraid the producers valued the dramatic purposes, but as it played out there where only good vibes and almost never any harmful intent by any anyone.

It is without a doubt a romantic comedy-show, but it also has layers of depth. One could actually learn something, besides having a great time.

I think Brene Brown would be proud of this shiksa.",literal

"MGM+ Seems like it could be a good show, but I couldn't take my eyes off the glaringly large MGM+ logo in the corner!! I know the first episode is free and if I like it I will need to subscribe.

"Good, but... Good, and very well made, but it reminded me too much of From Dusk Until Dawn - and took forever to get to the horror aspects of the film. This should have been tighter and better. The 2nd climax (with the Klan) was unnecessary and the slow first half also unnecessary. Lastly, the vampires seemed to not be so bright as well. What was there plan when the sun came up? Apparently, there was no plan. They just stood around and let it happen. Shame! With all involved, this should have been a classic. Again, incredibly well made, but nothing original brought to the genre; except for some truly original musical elements...",literal
"K-Pop: Demon Hunters - Short Review A Colorful, High-Energy K-Pop Adventure with Heart

This movie completely exceeded my expectations! From the very first scene, it pulls you in with vibrant, eye-catching animation that never lets up. Every frame is filled with personality, and the attention to detail in both character design and world-building is truly impressive. The visuals alone are worth the watch, but there's so much more going on here.

The action scenes are dynamic and well-choreographed, blending traditional fight choreography with creative, flashy stylistic choices that fit perfectly with the tone of the film. It's clear a lot of love went into making every punch, spin, and explosion feel exciting and fresh.

One of the absolute highlights for me was the music. The soundtrack is full of catchy, high-energy K-pop tracks that not only enhance the story but also add a unique identity to the film. It's not just background noise - the music is part of the experience. I found myself wanting to look up every song the moment the credits rolled. If you're a K-pop fan, you're in for a treat.

What surprised me the most, though, was the heart behind it all. Beneath the flashy visuals and pumping beats is a really sweet message about friendship, loyalty, and staying true to yourself even when the world is pushing you to be someone else. It never feels forced or overly sentimental - it just works.

This film manages to balance fun, action, music, and emotion in a way that feels effortless. It's stylish without being shallow, meaningful without being heavy-handed, and just an all-around great time. I'm already planning to rewatch it, and I wouldn't be surprised if it becomes a comfort movie for me.

Highly recommended for animation fans, K-pop lovers, and anyone who enjoys a good story told with flair and fun. This is one of those films that leaves you smiling long after it's over.

"Were you supposed to fall asleep watching this? I tried to watch Eddington but then at around the 1 hour mark I started watching my watch instead and realising there's STILL another hour and a half to go!!!

The tedium of the slooow burn build up using annoying boooringly written shallow trope characters was beyond comprehension..you could literally have made a twenty minute short with more impact and get your message across far more effectively.

"Rather disappointing. I am a major fan of Candice Millard and her fabulous book Destiny of the Republic, which this show is based. The story tells an important story of an under-reported time in our country's history and explains how the acts of one man altered the course of our nation. That said, the show was rather disappointing and did not do ample credit to its source material. My recommendation - skip the show and spend 4 hours reading Millard's outstanding book. You won't be disappointed.",literal
"Is it for fans of the game / books only? I really dont get the hype about this. I haven't played the games but the story of the series is stupid and seems cheap.

Henry Cavill is doing well though.",literal
"Third time's the charm.. Not really! 10 years after the Horsemen's second act, three young magicians make their entry - Charlie, Bosco and June. Charlie is the man behind the tricks, Bosco and June are the faces who sell the show. Their trick impersonates the four horsemen which catches the attention of Daniel Atlas. It is revealed that The Eye has tasked Daniel to gather the three young magicians to go after the bigger fish, Veronica Vanderburg who is the head of a diamond company. She owns the largest diamond known as the heart diamond. The new horsemen are supposed to steal the heart diamond and expose Veronica of her crimes. The newer bunch definitely need the older crew to pull this off or do they?

It's been over 9 years since the last film released and it definitely took a longer break to make the third one. The first half introduces to the fun trio of younger magicians and they impress instantly. The mystery behind why The Eye wanted these three to join forces with the original horsemen is executed well till the end of the first half. The entertaining scenes too mostly get restricted to the first half. The highlight being the scenes in France at an estate and the tricks do steal the show. However, the weak villain and the weaker reveal in the third act, pulls down the film considerably and the charismatic performance by Dominic Sessa was not enough to save the film. It's sad to see Rosamund Pike get a weakly written role and the screenplay got quickly predictable. The heist scenes were a step down from the last two films. It obviously sticks to the usual template with the franchise regular making their short appearances. Overall, it is the weakest of the three films.",figurative
"Loved it I actually enjoyed the way they teased the back story in throughout the episodes. Jason Bateman was cooking with gas, Jude Law trailed a bit behind this time but was still watchable.

Junior played it well and I detested him as intended!",literal

"Life finds a way This film is a thrilling, visually stunning spectacle that'll leave you breathless! Gareth Edwards masterfully crafts a Spielberg-esque adventure, blending nostalgic nods to Jurassic Park with heart-pumping action sequences and awe-inspiring dinosaurs. Finally! The T-Rex river raft scene saw the light of day! The new creatures are both majestic and menacing, dude that T-Rex was big, making for an unforgettable experience. With standout performances from the cast, including Jonathan Bailey bringing his signature charm and Scarlett Johansson delivering intensity, this movie is a must-see. Edwards' understanding of dinosaurs as both majestic and terrifying shines through, making this a hugely impressive film. The film's visuals are breathtaking, and the anxiety-filled action sequences will have you on the edge of your seat. However, be warned: intense dismemberment and gore might spook some viewers. If you're a fan of the Jurassic series, you'll love it - and hopefully, Edwards will continue to bring these prehistoric wonders to life! With its perfect blend of nostalgia, thrills, and stunning visuals, this film is an absolute must-watch on the big screen.",figurative
"Hollywood-type historical thriller in French It is naturally more sensual and authentic than its US counterparts, but I still have mixed feelings about this film. Most of actors are fine (especially Kassel, Dacascos and Bertolucci), tensions are high at times, but the script is too uneven, the Animal badly inserted (technically) and the ending is long and awkward. To me, the fight scenes do not fit in the medieval French village life, but I am sure they added (younger) viewers within and out of France (after all, Dacascos comes from Hollywood and is good at martial arts). Besides, the film could have been shorter, not some 2h 20 min.

But Le Pacte des Loups is definitely for you if you wish to experience sublime feelings, pretty costumes and history mixed with mystic. But evil is often related to man...",literal

"""Hey Killian, I'll Be Back!"" Arnold Schwarzenegger, Richard Dawson, Maria Conchita Alonso, Yaphet Kotto, Jesse Ventura and Jim Brown star in this 1987 sci-fi film based on the novel. This takes place in the year, 2019 and Ben Richards (Schwarzenegger) is an ex-soldier framed for murdering innocent civilians. He's chosen to be a guest on the number one TV reality show, ""The Running Man"" hosted by Damon Killian (Dawson). The show has convicts face deadly henchman called, Stalkers within 3 hours and if the convicts win, they're pardoned. Ben fights to the death to prove his innocence and get back at the sadistic, Killian. Alonso plays Amber Mendez, a woman who also becomes part of the show and helps Ben. Kotto plays William Laughlin, a convict who befriends Ben, but gets killed in battle. Ventura plays Captain Freedom and Brown plays Fireball. I've always liked this film and Arnold is great as usual. Dawson was also a good villain and I recommend this 80's classic.",literal
"Festive fun Griswold style Its a fun filled Christmas, Clark Griswold style with Chevy Chase more likable and less laconic who wants to have a traditional family Christmas with his family.

He goes out to the mountain to get a big Christmas tree, he puts down a deposit for swimming pool hoping his Christmas bonus will come through and wants to have the perfect Christmas, what can go wrong?

Almost everything as more family members turn up including his cousin played by Randy Quaid and his troublesome dog. His neighbours are annoyed and if that bonus does not come through Clark is up a creek without a paddle.

Its huge zany fun especially as some of the cantankerous elderly members of the family provide a lot of humour, plenty of slapstick and the syrupy schmaltz is kept to a minimum. Its probably the last great National Lampoon vacation film made.",literal
"Not so bad not so good I decided to watch Freaky Friday again, mostly out of nostalgia rather than high expectations. It's not exactly a cinematic masterpiece, but it has that familiar, feel-good charm that brings you back to a simpler time.

The story about switching bodies - is predictable, but it works well enough the second timw. What gives the film a bit of freshness is the energy brought by the young actresses, who add some brightness and fun to an otherwise average script. Their performances give the movie a certain warmth that makes it more enjoyable than it probably deserves to be.

So no, the film isn't amazing - but it's light, it's harmless, and if you're feeling nostalgic like I was, it might just hit the spot.

⭐ Rating: 6/10 - mostly for the nostalgia and the youthful charm.",figurative
"Phenomenal Absolutely phenomenal show. The first time I watched it I was so enthralled. I really love Jackie and Dr. O'Hara. Jackie is so likable and I felt for her as both a mother and person. I'm not the biggest fan of her husband, I like Eddie a lot more for her. You can see the shift when the writers changed though and although I wouldn't say the show necessarily declines in quality I do not like certain plot lines at all. I don't want to put any spoilers but seeing Jackie become an o****ly and the way they all treat her especially zoey absolutely disgusted me. Jackie did some messsd up crap but that doesn't make her a bad person. The ending made me very emotional. When you see the last episode you'll see what I'm talking about. It's time to rewatch so I need Amazon prime to make it free or Netflix.",literal

"""Good Fortune"" Misses the Mark... The latest film from Aziz Ansari tries in earnest to send the message that not only is everyone's life worth living no matter the circumstances one finds themselves in. Where the film gets lost in translation is when it starts to compare Arj's life vs. Jeff's life. Arj has a lot of problems from money to housing to relationship problems. Jeff, on the other hand, seems to have it all from the big house to the money to the cushy ""job"" he has where he goes to fancy meals at expensive restaurants to talk business for a brief time. Jeff has everything that Arj seemingly wants. And all of this is shown in the trailers. The biggest problem with the film is that for everything Jeff has, he has ZERO problems in the film other than Arj taking his place. This isn't realistic. Even people with money in the real world have problems. Thus, I don't like the way they wrote the character of Jeff, because this isn't realistic. The film had a gold opportunity to express that even Jeff and wealthy individuals have problems in spite of their money and material possessions. The film by its very nature implies that Jeff's life is essentially perfect because all it shows is his only problem of trying to switch back with Arj. Keanu Reeves was fantastic as always. I would not recommend ""Good Fortune"" because it comes across as someone's opinion of how financially poor and rich people live not a realistic portrayal by any means. But, if you must see this, I would suggest waiting for legal streaming.",figurative
"A not great, but decent show. I am sure you read the premise in other reviews and no spoilers here. It is generally a good show and for me personally what made me give this a 7 was mostly the writing and the finally was a bit of a let down. No real surprises and I think 9 episodes wasn't enough so it just seemed like they tried to cram too much into the last episode of the season.

The season has quick emotional swings in a number of Dwight's relationships that were all predictable and often rushed. The emotional development on a number of characters was too quick and dramatic as well. This goes both ways in either their loss of inner strength or going from someone that will faint from a sneeze to a stone cold killer. The changes are almost instant and would have been better if it was done over time versus rushed.

Overall, if you like Stallone you will enjoy the show.",literal

"IT (2017) Review Great horror films are rare these days mainly because most of them are redundant sequels and remakes that do very little to aid the story or the scares. Even though this 2017 version of IT is a remake of the Stephen King classic, it is one of the best horror films I have seen in a long time. With killer clowns, death of children and monsters attacking you left and right, what's not to love? The film follows the same plot as the massive first part of the classic 1986 novel with the second half to be finished in a sequel. Seven children are being hunted and prayed on by a child-eating alien disguised as a clown known as Pennywise for each of their own fears and traumas. One child in particular, Bill Denbrough (Jayden Lieberher) is obsessed with founding and defeating the clown because he believes he will also find his younger brother who was captured by the alien months earlier with many believing him to be dead.  This makes us connect emotionally with Bill as well as the other characters who have fears of their own such as Beverly Marsh (Sophia Lillis) the only female of the group who is sexually abused by her father. This formula can be repetitive but it is terrifying when each child has their own encounter with Pennywise. Cinematography is also to great effect in IT. Camera movement gets incredibly shaky during intense chase scenes but the camera also takes the time to slow down to explore the emotionally levity of some scenes. Shadows are used effectively to add to the sinister nature of the film like the sewer locations where the unknown evil of Pennywise lurk. The actors of the children also act well in their current surroundings and reasonably act like coming of age children. Bill as mentioned earlier is obsessed with finding IT and his younger brother and due to his young age acts impulsively without much consideration of his actions or his friends like any coming of age child would. CGI can look pretty suspect in a few scenes with Pennywise. When he starts attacking, he does these really forced shaky motions that can take away from the scene a little bit, but not enough to ruin the horror and tension of the scenes. For any horror fan, IT is an absolute must see, especially in the dark of the cinema.",literal
"Good Sequel So, having seen the 2003 classic, I heard somewhere that they were making a sequel, but forgot about it. It was until recently that I discovered there was a sequel coming out & had to go & see it from seeing the 2003 film.

22 years after Tess & Anna endured an identity crisis, Anna now has a daughter & a soon-to-be stepdaughter. As they navigate the challenges that come when two families merge, Tess & Anna discover that lightning might strike twice.

I found the film to be pretty good. It's not amazing as such or half as good as the first film, but, it's pretty good & entertaining enough. The concept is much the same & rehash like. But here, it shows the mum & daughter switching bodies with Anna daughter & step daughter, as a pose to themselves. So, it's a little more confusing & mind messing here, but you get it just about. The actors do a good job with their roles including the legacy characters.

The story is interesting her, but much the same as any other film of its type. There's some funny humour & skits here which are good & entertaining as well as some feel good moments. There's plenty of eye candy too, so you won't be disappointing. I will say the film had pacing issues & was overly long at 1 hour & 44 minutes (104 minutes). The film felt satanised, so the humour wasn't as funny as it could've been given the sf climate we live in, but hey.

Overall, it's a good sequel. Not amazing, but good enough & watchable. You won't be disappointed with it, but don't expect it to be as good as the first which by the way features the same song heard at the end which gave me goosebumps. Watch it, but don't expect to be laughing out loud as much as the first which was made when people could have a joke.

6/10.",literal
As bad as anything can get This is a total waste of time for any viewer. Many say a 'great cast' and that may be true but how can a 'great cast' get together to make something so stupid and completely vapid. This is not worth ANYBODY's time or effort to watch. I often wonder how something so completely bad gets made and placed in a finished film can. 'All is Fair' would be better titled as 'All is 5hit',literal
"Extraordinary piece of TV Breaking Bad is an extraordinary piece of television that transcends the boundaries of its medium, offering a narrative experience that is as intense as it is intellectually stimulating. This series, created by Vince Gilligan, stands out for its masterful storytelling, intricate character development, and its unflinching exploration of moral ambiguity.

From the very first episode, the show grabs hold of the viewer's attention and refuses to let go. The journey of Walter White, a high school chemistry teacher turned methamphetamine kingpin, is as compelling as it is tragic. Bryan Cranston delivers a career-defining performance, transforming Walter from a desperate man into a ruthless figure, all while retaining a semblance of the person he once was. Cranston's portrayal is complemented perfectly by Aaron Paul's Jesse Pinkman, whose own arc is equally profound, navigating themes of guilt, redemption, and survival.

The writing is nothing short of brilliant. Each episode is meticulously crafted, with a narrative that weaves together tension, dark humor, and shocking twists. The dialogue is sharp, often loaded with subtext, and the pacing is impeccable, gradually building up to moments of pure suspense. The cinematography and direction further elevate the show, with a visual style that captures the desolation of the New Mexico desert and the stark realities of the characters' lives.

One of the most remarkable aspects of Breaking Bad is its exploration of the consequences of one man's decisions, not just for himself but for those around him. It poses deep ethical questions and examines the lengths to which people will go when pushed to their limits. The show doesn't shy away from depicting the harsh realities of the drug trade, yet it does so without glamorizing it, maintaining a stark, often gritty realism.

The supporting cast, including Anna Gunn, Dean Norris, and Giancarlo Esposito, add further depth to the narrative, each delivering powerful performances that enhance the central storyline. Esposito's portrayal of Gustavo Fring, in particular, is chilling, providing a counterbalance to Walter's own descent into darkness.

In conclusion, Breaking Bad is more than just a television show; it's a masterpiece that leaves a lasting impact. It challenges its audience, subverts expectations, and ultimately tells a story that is as much about the human condition as it is about crime. It is a must-watch for anyone who appreciates top-tier drama, and it has rightly earned its place as one of the greatest television series of all time.",figurative
"Incompetence at the highest level. Netflix should fire producers, directors and writers.

01. The inclusion of people of color was poorly planned. I'm not against it, but you can do it more carefully, even to preserve actors who end up being attacked for doing their job. For example, they could have made all the elves people of color, even putting an interesting social critique in it while having relevant roles ended up being destined for people of color. This carelessness is made worse by the fact that it is a Slavic story, which could and should involve Slavic actors, who also have little space in the film industry.

02. There is a lot of racism in the criticism against actors who are physically different from how their characters are presented in books and games, but several cases of miscasting only makes it worse. A good example of this is Anya Chalotra, the female protagonist, whose character in the games looks like Eva Green/Alexandra Daddario, but which Chalotra - a good actress, very beautiful and charismatic - manages to deliver. There's a lot less complaining about her, even though she's a leading lady, because there's much of the character in her and she acts well. In other words: she was well casted...

03. All this fuss would be irrelevant if the writing was good and faithful, but the writing is really bad and strays from the source material for no reason.

04. The first season could be much better. The following ones should stick to Witcher 3 stories. Reinvent a story with millions of fans is not only disrespectful: it is stupidity and incompetence at the highest level.

05. I could believe that this fiasco is due to prejudice against video game stories, but Amazon did the same with Tolkien, whose quality is absolutely indisputable. Netflix could have made a lot of money and delivered a product of artistic value. But no...

Fire these incompetents and start over in a year or two. Stop hurting the material.",literal
"The perfect balance This magnificent series, mixing a protagonist with an incredible power that seems to have it all, but no, you have to be recognized as the greatest hero in the world, and seems to have a few seasons to pass. Thus we have an almost immortal protagonist that despite being so strong is the plot that I mentioned being the best known and not the strongest. Moreover fights are brutal, even the soundtrack too, and the opening. Perfect.

This series also mixes its incredible action with the best comedy that may exist, the protagonist despite having a ridiculous design is really charismatic when angry or gets serious, certainly crazy girls you see Saitama.

"Boring, sterile, cheesy After hearing so many positive reviews for this show, I finally gave it a go last night and I can't for the life of me understand the hype around it. I only watched the first two episodes but it was enough for me to analyze the acting and production, which I felt was lax. The first few episodes always pull out some cheesy situations like first day med students fainting at the sight of blood followed by the predictable and cliche line ""med student down"" by the more seasoned doctors. Like, that's not funny or realistic. None of the dialogue was particularly intriguing or thought provoking. None of the scenes had any real emotion. It takes place in an ER and none of the scenes felt like it was taking place in an ER. The set was too quiet. You didn't hear the ringing of phones, rolling of carts, chatter of everyone else around. It sounded like the night shift in the geriatric ward. I guess I'm just disappointed because unlike so many emergency and medical drama shows produced by John Wells in the past (ER, Third Watch) which he did such a good job portraying emotion and realistic acting, The Pitt feels sterile. No emotion, no heart pumping emergency action. It's just kinda blah. The realistic accuracy of situations is what people are mostly praising about this show but that's not enough for me to like it or give it a good score. I need to feel something too. I need the dialogue to be believable. I need to be able to sympathize with the actors and I just don't get any of that with this show.",literal
"A perfectly fun threequel if lacking a bit of depth beneath the showmanship I might go on to slag this movie off a bit over the course of this review, but I will go on record to say that I did enjoy it. It's got it's flaws, but it is entertaining regardless.

In terms of the overall vibe of the film, if you'll excuse the on the nose observation, it does just have a little bit of magic to it. I love a heist film and the magic elements are so fun. There's a lot of different tricks and elements that are all very imaginative. I'm also a big fan of that moment in a heist movie where they do the whole ""here's how we did it"" reveal, and the payoff in this movie is actually pretty good. It makes a lot of sense and ties the whole film together well. Does the satisfying ending justify the journey? Not entirely. Large swathes of the film feel very corny and clunky. The story is fun enough but there is very little depth to the characters. You can't move for cliche dialogue and tropes, which get to be a bit laborious, especially when the original horsemen are back together.

Speaking of the original horsemen, I can't shake the feeling that none of the actors cared much about this film. The performances felt very phoned in and had no energy or effort to them. The whole thing screams big payday. I'm not saying this had to be a passion project for any of them, but it was quite noticeable compared to the new cast members. At least newbies Dominic Sessa, Justice Smith, and Ariana Greenblatt looked like they were having a lot of fun. If this film was intended to be a passing of the baton to a new group of magicians, I wouldn't mind seeing more films with these three as leads. In terms of the connection between the cast, I was glad to see that the whole antagonistic one upmanship vibe between the two generations of magicians wasn't as pronounced as the trailer suggests, which was a relief.

Ultimately then, this film is itself a bit like a magic trick. Don't look too closely as you might not like what you find. Its best not to dissect it too closely, just sit back and enjoy the show.",figurative
"Finnish John Wick Sisu is about a gold miner who finds the richest of golds in an underground pit. He must trade the gold for cash to a bank. Although, he lives thousands of miles away from a bank and must travel on foot. On the way there, he encounters German Nazis along the way who want to steal it from him. He must fight throughout all of them in order to deposit his gold.

The first impressions of Sisu gave me that it was a bloody, fun, and good time of a gold miner killing Nazis. Since John Wick was heavily inspired by director, Jalmari Helander, that this movie is basically the German 1940's war version of John Wick. Jorma Tommila's (main protagonist) acting skills were badass from his creative surviving skills to kill the Nazis. The deaths were entertaining with the special effects and CGI of them. Overall, Sisu is good with its acting, kills, and story. I would recommend Sisu in theaters for a good action watch.",literal
Great watching for us Boomers I am 67 years old and it was so wonderful to see so many of our generation of actors and their great comedic styles. These actors only get better with age and are wonderfully cast in this sweet Comedy Series! The script gets a little lost trying to solve the mystery and gets more in depth with the character's storylines. That's ok because you have a pretty good idea who is the culprit about half way through. You don't mind that it isn't really a mystery because you are just having a fun time watching these golden oldies work and show their stuff. It's really no mystery. Just a tribute to how brave you have to be an older citizen and still active and feel seen in our youth oriented society. What a sweet tribute to those who support and help us navigate the minefields of getting old this series was. Thank you for giving me a great Saturday of binge watching this series!,literal

Some actors behaviour was forced and after sitting for 2 hours in the cinema, watching the singing and dancing got me almost asleep. I know, it's a musical, but still. Lot of unwanted parts, they should have focused more on the story, the characters. Because at some point it got interesting, a mystery came up about the animals, someone wanted to silence them. But after that it's like they forgot this completely because the party came up, everything was colorful and everyone was dancing and singing again for 1 hour like what the hell?

"You reap what you sow Unfortunately, the story tells us the ending from its introduction, or rather from its title. The story did not talk about the life of the samurai in depth, it was just a superficial story. The title should have been Kodoko, the mystery in the story was more beautiful.

The sequence of events is lacking, and the pacing is incredibly fast. The story feels incomplete; I believe a novel or story would be much deeper, but the series is significantly condensed. It would have been better if they had structured the game around a full month of playtime, rather than focusing on the number of players and their dwindling numbers. The work needs more creativity; a detailed explanation of each of the main characters is essential. To be honest, they could have created a much better work. The overall story is beautiful, with few flaws, and the scenes are good too. I hope the second season is even better. I love samurai stories, but not when they're so condensed.",literal
"James Gunn's Predator This is the Predator, but if it was some weird multi-verse, where the Predator travels through time and space, to join the Avengers, in a quest to slay some comic villain.

We now have a zoomer equivalent of a predator, that pissed off his father, because he stayed playing video games until too late, instead of hunting prey.",literal
"Every Christmas we love it There's no way that National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation should be as good as it is. By 1989, Chevy Chase had become, well, Chevy Chase and a holiday film three movies in feels like a cash-in. And yet this is a movie that my wife's family watches every single year and now, I've become part of that tradition.

The first movie by director Jeremiah S. Chechik (who went on to direct Diabolique), the real joy of this movie is the script by John Hughes, based on his story Christmas '59.

Chase and D'Angelo are back, but as always, the kids are played by different actors. This time, Audrey is Juliette Lewis and Rusty is Johnny Galecki. This probably has the smartest casting of any of the films in the series, with Clark's parents being played by John Randolph and Diane Ladd, Ellen's by E. G. Marshall and Doris Roberts, William Hickey and Mae Questel as the elderly and deranged Lewis and Bethany Griswold, evil neighbors the Chesters played by Julia-Louis Dreyfuss and Nicholas Guest, and most importantly, Randy Quaid and Miriam Flynn returning as Eddie and Catherine.

Eddie's appearance surprises me every time, how he just shows up out of nowhere and then takes over the movie. Yes, in the days before he was a conspiracy driven near-insane man, Randy Quaid had incredible comic timing.

It also has the episodic story idea that works so well from the first movie as you can come into this movie at any time and enjoy it. I mean, the shopping for lingerie scene? The sled riding? Randy waving in the pool dream? There are so many moments that make me laugh just imagining them.

Director Chris Columbus started as the director, but he and Chevy Chase did not get along, so John Hughes replaced him and gave him Home Alone. That worked out, right?

It also will never fail to blow my mind that Angelo Badalamenti did the score to this.

We haven't watched this movie since two Christmas Days ago. My father-in-law, who would shush us all and make us all watch it together no matter what, is gone and maybe it's too hard to watch. The closing line, where Clark just says, ""I did it"" used to make me cry before because it's so wonderful and perfect and sums up the end of the holidays as an adult so well. But now, in a year where I've lost both of the fathers in my life, it seems like it all could all be too much.",literal
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED Really fun. The best trio ever. Mabel mora is my fav character ever . Highly recommended.,literal
"I love Renner, but 5 and dropping like a rock... It was fun to watch at the beginning even though it was kind of hard to believe. The actors were very good, especially Toby Bamfeta, and Jeremy Renner doing a classic JR character. And it moved fast and was intense. But it has become ridiculous, confusing and hard to watch. How does this guy make money? Why do the cops just do whatever he says? Why do they need to manage everything so the drug businesses run smoothly on both sides of the wall? How many prisons are there, and how are they related? Why does a white supreme ist drug lord get to move to whatever prison he wants and how does he run everything from prison? Why does the SWAT guy kill people left and right and there's never an official review or time out? Etc etc etc etc etc, it's just absurd. Taylor Sheridan understands narrative tension, pacing and sex-and-violence TV but none of his shows make any actual sense whatsoever,",literal
"another victem of wooke I like criminal intent of the same director. FBI is almost as good. The first 2 seasons were good. But the last season 3 is annoying. Just like in other series of 2021, all of a sudden all the native Americans are victims. I understand that there is racism but too make every episode about that spoils the series. The acting is very good. The stories are ok too with some exceptions. I guess a real FBI agent will laugh when he watch this.",literal
"Went downhill big time Started off amazing. I gave the first season a 9/10, and even enjoyed the second even though I was left wanting. However, the third was trash. Only the first couple seasons keeps my rating up to a 6/10- but last season is really a 3/10. I only ever read one book of The Witcher years ago, so I didn't care as much about source material as others- but bad writing is bad writing. Such a waste of potential.

It makes sense why Cavill left the project. I'm unsure if they still renewed this for a 4th season, but I won't be watching it & I am positive it will be the last. Where these writers got the idea they could write a better story than a NYT bestseller, I do not know, but hopefully it's obvious to them now that they failed miserably.",literal
"A true classic This is The Godfather of TV series. I've rewatched all 86 episodes a few times and it's quite amazing how they'd kept up the quality over so many episodes. Aside from the great acting and writing, the directing is incredible - there are many scenes where nothing special happens, yet the atmosphere makes these scenes unforgettable. Character development at its best: I felt like I was there, experiencing their world throughout the series. A masterpiece.",figurative
"Execution inaccurate The movie was brilliant. However it should be noted that the execution scene was inaccurate. Instead of one gallows they had three. Two in use and one in reserve. Initially the prisoners were going to be allowed to walk to the gallows hands free but after Göring's suicide, they were led to the gallows with their hands tied. Julius Striker was not the first prisoner executed. That was Joachim von Ribbontraup and Striker was not the sniveling coward at his execution as portrayed but defiant to the end.",literal
"FOX has a hit! Fox's new medical drama Doc is a standout hit that brings a fresh and compelling twist to the genre. With sharp writing, strong character development, and high-stakes drama, it effortlessly captures the essence of what makes a medical show both captivating and emotionally resonant. Each episode blends gripping medical cases with the personal lives of the characters, creating a perfect balance of tension and heart.

Overall, Doc is a must-watch for anyone who enjoys emotionally-driven dramas with compelling characters. The combination of gripping medical cases and powerful performances, especially from Vann, ensures this show will resonate with audiences for seasons to come. Super Enjoyable.",literal
"A suitably heartfelt return Freakier Friday certainly lives up to its title by doubling the amount of body swapping which can get confusing early on. It follows the same formula as the original so it nails all the necessary heartfelt moments and is generally pretty funny, even if it is a little too long. It may look like something originally intended for Disney plus but this is wholeheartedly worthy of the theatrical release it was given and is definitely the best Disney film to get the upgrade out of the most recent ones.

Lindsay Lohan & Jamie Lee Curtis are great and both get to have fun playing characters younger than they are this time. Jamie Lee Curtis is obviously the best part of the whole film with the most energy by far. Julia Butters & Sophia Hammons aren't as strong however they do improve once their characters have swapped personalities. Manny Jacinto's loveable performance adds a nice amount of charm and heart to proceedings, as does Mark Harmon in his small role.

Nisha Ganatra's direction brings some visual flair and is generally quite colourful, plus the welcome inclusion of outtakes in the end credits is always an easy win. Matthew Clark's constantly capable cinematography plays it safe for the most part with the occasional impressive flourish for the big body swapping moments. There's a lot of low hanging fruit jokes about getting older but none of them properly overstay their welcome and a few of them are actually really funny.",literal
"I love it I love it! What I like about it is that it's laidback and funny. There's enough drama in the world, I don't need complicated dramatic tv. I just want something lighthearted and relaxing to watch. Will definitely continue to watch it. It's become mine and my husbands show to watch on Wednesdays with some takeout. So far nothing on this show is over the top and dramatic. It's lighthearted fun that shows different characters from different backgrounds and the different types of issues they might face. I've recommended it to friends and family and my daughter also enjoys watching it. I definitely recommend it.",literal
"Best comedy show ever I think the office is the best comedy show ever.

The jokes, the characters are all amazing!

A show with hard and dry humor and finally a show that's actually funny!

I wish I could watch it again for the first time!

The characters just feel like friends and family.

They couldn't have cast the actors any better.

You really get the feeling that the actors aren't acting and that they are really like that in real life.

I must confess I didn't finish the show because I couldn't watch it anymore when Michael left.

It's a shame that he left and I would have been happier if they would have end the show earlier with him.

I really wished they would make more shows like this.

If you have dry humor and you like to laugh then watch The Office!",literal
"One of the best surprises of 2025 The feeling is that of having watched something genuine and comforting. A film that entertains, but also moves; that talks about escapes and lies, but above all, about the desire to start over.

The Good Bandit may not explore all the themes it presents, but what it delivers is done with such care and balance that it is impossible not to be captivated.

With inspired direction and Channing Tatum at his best, the film confirms that the best films of the year are not always the most grandiose-sometimes they are simply those that know how to tell a good story with heart.",literal
"This show serves it's purpose, with grace! Now this show is not without problems. I'll be the first to admit it. It's very basic premise and sometimes convenient plot turns are not lost on me. Two monster hunting brothers travel cross country and extinguish a different monster each week. Not too much on the original side, I know. However, I can't help but watch this show every week with a fondness for my old junior high days. For those who don't know I was a huge sci-if/horror geek in my younger years and I loved reading about ""The Crazy Hook Man who kills Teenagers"" or ""The Ghost of the Lady in White"". I ate those stories up, and apparently so did the show's creator. This show takes me back to the years before I learned what character arcs, and plot contrivances were. It strips that all away and just lets me enjoy what it was like to hear ghost stories. What it was like to get chills down my spine every time I rode down a dark road at night expecting an apparition in white to appear. What it was like to come so close to saying ""Bloody Mary"" to the mirror and then passing out. There is a likability to this show that can't be ignored, and there's even some great moments with the two main characters Sam and Dean (played quite well by Padalecki and Ackles) but it is that nostalgic feeling above all that brings me back each week.",literal
"A mediocre start and a weak base The first episode is a paint by numbers picture. Last seen in ""The Last of us"". Although ""The last of us"" did it way better. Mystery event, fast collapse of society. Yadayada. Colony, Falling Skies, 3 Body Problem, V, Defiance, Invasion (pick one), The Rain, The Strain, Sense8. Pluribus is nothing new or original. Just another uninspired social study in TV Show form with a scifi setting.",literal
"Amazing! Mayor of Kingstown has easily become one of my favorite new shows of the last few years. It's hard to go wrong with a star studded cast that includes Jeremy Renner, Dianne Wiest, Emma Laird, Aiden Gillen, etc. Kyle Chandler is only in it for the first episode and a few flashbacks but it's a major part and he's as terrific as always. What else can be said about Taylor Sheridan that hasn't already been said? Everything he does is a hit. I love all his shows and movies, they just seem to get better and better. If you haven't seen this yet do yourself a favor and make sure you give yourself some time because you're going to want to binge it as fast as you can. Jeremy Renner just got into a bad accident so I hope he's ok. God willing, he'll be able to live a full and healthy life. If he is able to continue acting I sure hope he does a few more seasons of Mayor of Kingstown. I absolutely love it and can't wait for future seasons!",literal
"I tried to suspend my disbelief, I really did... I knew what I was watching and discounted my expectations appropriately. I suspended my disbelief as much as humanly possible. The lack of attention to detail and reality wouldn't let me enjoy it. The scene where the marshals first find the crash site was so unrealistic I couldn't enjoy. They saunter onto this crash without any sense of emergency, call no-one, don't communicate to each other... Thankfully, when they were ""ambushed"" by seemingly dozens of criminals, every single shot that Frank took was a kill shot that flung the victim across the snow, even if the squibs on the actors were on a collar bone or a shoulder... ugh.",literal
My favorite Christmas Comedy! From the first time I saw this movie back in '89 I've loved it ever since. It's pure comedy gold & its totally hilarious. I watch it every Christmas & it still makes me laugh out loud. Chevy Chase has always been so damn funny as Clark Griswold & Randy Quaid as Cousin Eddie always cracks me up. It's such a quotable movie too. They don't make comedies like this anymore. Thank goodness for classic movies.,literal
"It just keeps getting better and thats unheard of!! Someone is responsible for making this such an outstanding show, year after year. The intelligence in dialogue, empathy for characters, twists and expectations are genius. Breaking bad, The X Files are 2 other badges of brilliance. We are privileged to be living in this time as we might have been if living during Shakespeare. This may seem over the top but the scores are on the board, Vince Gilligan. Please correct or remove if I am wrong!",literal
"Bellow a 7??? How?! It's a solid 7.6 but I'm giving it an 8 because 7.6 isn't an option and because of math and rounding up. This is a mystery drama comedy with an extra edge/a little darkness to it. Sort of like White Lotus meets Only Murders in the Building meets its own thing. I honestly think I like it slightly better than WL and OMITB- well maybe tied with WL. I digress- this show is witty, surprising, but also predictable in spots, yet refreshing. Have I used all the adjectives yet?

The acting is SO good with a phenomenal main cast. There is one side character I won't name that needs some acting lessons, but you can overlook that because everyone else excelled my expectations. Can't say enough about Wigg's performance- I didn't realize what an amazing dramatic actress she is in addition to comedy. She plays Maxine Dellacorte, a wife trying to sneak her way in to 1960s high society. She is so fun to watch and root for. She is smart but also naive and just more complex than she appears; the whole cast is really. There are 2 episodes left and honestly who knows what will happen but can't wait to find out.

I could go on and on but I'll just close by saying if you are on the fence - jump off and check out the 1st episode. You will know if you want to keep watching. Enjoy!",literal
"Intelligent, Insightful, Hilarious - Hooray for ""Gilmore Girls"" I have been hooked on ""GG"" since midway through 2001-2002 (2nd season), when I tuned in to see ""Smallville"" 10 minutes early. Thanks to ""Beginnings"", I now have all but 2 episodes on tape, right up through last night (Ep. 4.9). I am a middle-aged straight male, and this is the ONLY weekly TV show I watch.

  I love this series because: a) Lauren Graham is a damn fine-looking woman, and funny and smart to boot; b) the dialogue is extremely well-written; c) it is flat-out hilarious, putting overrated garbage like ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" to shame. Many current TV comedies have been heavily influenced by the highly successful and much-despised slime-pit known as ""Married with Children"", where the viewer is encouraged to deride and feel superior to the characters. In ""GG"", the characters have faults, but we can see our own foibles in them, and laugh with them, not at them. This is stimulating TV, where the writers challenge us to keep up with rapid-fire exchanges and out-of-left-field pop-culture/literature/current events references. I get immense pleasure out of watching these episodes over and over again, catching all the one-liners and references to previous episodes. Stars Hollow is its own little world, one that I will happily continue to visit as long as the series runs.",literal
"Mockumentary Era We will soon tire of the mockumentary style the same way the fake audience laughter grew old but for now I am loving it.

St. Denis Medical found their own way to deliver laughs using this popular modern form. Lots of shows try and I watch them because I like this style but they don't all hit the mark. This show has me in tears! I can't believe how good it is.

The Office, Parks and Rec., and Modern Family are the tops in this area and I believe St. Denis Medical will find its place among them. That's all I have to say. Enjoy.",figurative
"Just more of the same I wish I could take a previous review for a Jurassic park clone and insert it here to get across the effort the studio is putting into these now. It's just a cheap cash in for some money. Very boring and predictable. The CGI actually looked worse than the 1993 movie. How is that even possible you ask? By just having gratuitous CGI constantly. It just looks bad and I'm actually depressed after watching this. Something about it all just felt cynical and like it somehow ruined my love of the original a little bit. With that said, this is the last ride for me on this franchise. It hasn't been good for decades as I look back and think about these films.",literal
"Interesting, but save the bucks. If you are debating to either go to the theaters and watch Weapons or wait to rent it at home, I would wait it out. Weapons is another one of those, ""Greatest movies of the year!"" That falls short of just being ok.

After watching it in theaters, I realized Weapons was simply a long drawn out witch movie, with weak character plotting, very few scares, and cringe jokes. Although these things made this movie seem very underwhelming, it wasn't terrible. There were a few good gory scenes that had me disturbed and the writing was decent, but that alone couldn't change my mind that this was just a mediocre movie. I feel that people don't remember great movies anymore, so when a halfway decent movie comes out everyone is so surprised.

So in my opinion, save the bucks and wait for it to go onto streaming services. You're not ""missing out.""",figurative
I'm Officially Done With Rotten Tomatoes For the life of me I cannot figure out the absolute terrible takes that the rotten tomatoes website has on actually good TV shows and movies. They literally called this a CW show with Wednesday Addams. I was shocked because I'll be honest this is probably the best experience I've had watching a show on Netflix since the first season of stranger things. Not only is it one of the best shows I've seen this year but it's probably one of the best things that Tim Burton has done in a very long time. Jenna Ortega is the best part of the show but all the other characters are extremely likable as well and nobody is perfect. Which is also the thing that I like the most is that everybody in the show is flawed. It's not super over the top cartoony dark like some of the movies are but it takes a little bit more of a realistic approach with the Addams family personalities and relationships. The Burton monster elements are still there though and they are awesome to watch. If you look at it more through the angle of Wednesday trying to find empathy and a reason to care about the people around her you get a lot more out of it. So for me personally I really don't understand why snobby critics just accuse us of being a cheesy teen drama with a consensus that you would see on CW... because it has a lot more to say than those types of shows and it's also very smart in the approach that they have with the Addams family and their relationship with each other and the people in the town that this takes place in. Please give this a watch this is a good show!,literal
"If you like Jesse Stone mysteries It has a very similar vibe to the Jesse Stone movies in my opinion. I like it, and I'm looking forward to a second season. The show centers on good acting and plot rather than shock value or flashy cgi.

Stay tuned past the first episode, and you will be glad you did. The plots in later episodes often involve all the characters rather than just being centered around the chief. The first episodes always start slowly to build background for the characters. I just hope that this show doesn't reach it's apex at the end of the first season and go downhill in the second season as many others have done in the past.",literal
"Horrible 3rd season The first two seasons of Monster were far better. They managed to keep a compelling balance of storytelling and authenticity, which made them engaging while still grounded in reality. Season three, however, is a disappointment.

The show piles on dramatic additions that go far beyond the truth, to the point of altering the real nature of Ed Gein's character. Even more damaging is the invention of new ""victims"" who never existed in Gein's actual crimes. This weakens the authenticity of the series to such a degree that it no longer feels like true crime-it slips instead into a kind of historical fantasy or sensationalized drama.

For anyone hoping for accuracy or genuine psychological exploration, season three feels like a serious misstep.",figurative
"ho hum I just couldn't get into this movie at all, maybe it's me, so sorry about that, it just seems like some have written that this is a not needed remake, the cinematography is good, the sets and the era are good, but so what, there's nothing making me want to start around for the story, indeed yawn yawn yawn.",literal
"watchable, but offers nothing new Let me started with some numbers. When a mega pharmaceutical outfit executive Martin Krebs (Rupert Friend) offers top-notch mercenary Zora Bennett (Scarlett Johansson) ""deep pocket"" reward for an assignment, she says she wants a number. ""Ten, with six zeroes"" comes the answer. ""Do the zeroes include the one in the ten?"" a logical follow-up question. ""No"", a straight answer that gets her attention. But not too long into the movie, the audience witness that what ten million dollars gets is someone who manages to miss a target, a dinosaur considerably bigger than the boats they are on. From that point on, I lowered my expectation bar. Still, it is reasonably entertaining, but offers nothing new, just checking off the boxes from all the previous tours to the Dinosaur Universe.

The ""trillion-dollar"" project involves going to an equatorial island to get samples of dinosaur blood. This is 32 years after Jurassic Park, when dinosaurs have become a nuisance rather than a curiosity interests. Fortunately for humans, the narrow equatorial belt provides the only environment where they can survive and so they are left alone, let be. But scientists have found that DNAs from certain such species can be developed into a miracle drug for heart disease. One such scientists Henry Loomis (Jonathan Bailey) naturally becomes the third member the team, to get blood samples from dinosaurs. A fourth is Zora's former fellow mercenary Duncan Kincaid (Mahershala Ali) who owns a boat and knows the area. There are of course various crew members but they are just moving stage props and most of them become dinosaur food eventually.

And then, there is subplot that just about every critic calls a waste of time (or maybe fillers of time, running time, that is, of the movie). It is a family that gets rescued by our exploration party after their boat is capsized by a dinosaur. This is a ""family"" of 4, the quotation mark denoting that it is parents and daughter, plus mother's tag-along, lazy ""boyfriend"". I'll just quote these lines to complete my description of the family. Mother to father, about her boyfriend ""there is another side of him you haven't seen"". Without batting an eye, the little girl quips ""The naked side!"" There, you have it. Will they become dinosaur food too? I'll let you find out for yourself.

The actors, all veterans and one with an Oscar, are all wasted because of the thin script. But I guess you could say that it would be even worse without them, and you are right. The technology side though is good, in some cases even better than the six predecessors. But that is to be expected as the first one, after all, was 32 years ago. While on that, there is one throwback scene, not to the old Jurassic Park era, but to the more recent reboot of Jurassic World. It is someone lighting up a flare to attract a dinosaur to follow. Here it is a macho man (Mahershala Ali) risking his life to save his friends. The retro scene from the recent reboot is a gorgeous woman (Bryce Dallas Howard), trying to bring a ""friendly"" dinosaur to battle a deadly opponent, again with the same purpose, to save her friends. Both offer a same magical cinematic moment when the flare in the hand of the actor lights up.",figurative
One of the greatest shows i've watched This is up there for one of my favorite shows i have ever watched. The characters in this show might be my favorite group of characters in a show ever. The cinematography is second to none. The acting is mostly amazing. Every season is good. The creators of this show haven't missed. S4 was the best.,literal
"Mediocre I love most of del Toro's movies, but this one is sadly a big fail.

All reviewers ooh-ing and aah-ing have clearly never seen the 1994 Brannagh version, which was far superior on all score: pacing, cast and direction.

Del Toro tries too hard to pull this into horror and misses all the key elements which make the original story a chilling gothic tale about the dangers of our species constant overreaching and ignoring the laws of nature.",literal
"Cults, eh? This was really something, only a lot of what happens in that school I had already seen from previous movies like The Miseducation of Cameron Post, Boy Erased, and others. Basically the techniques and the tactics are very much the same - abduction, inducing fear, submission, divide and conquer, stages, playing favourites, brainwashing, questionable psychotherapy, corporal punishment, psychological torture. And more... The only difference here is that they don't care about sexuality that much, they focus on other ""issues"". So some of the earlier episodes I was moaning to myself that I've seen this before and it's kind of boring. But the characters are well fleshed-out and engaging, and Toni Collette is loathsome and Mae Martin is cute and has those puppy eyes and you cannot help but feel sorry for the character. Also, she got ripped so that's a thing now apparently.

I felt the ending was pretty rushed and I didn't like how fast they concluded certain storylines, also was a little taken aback by Laura's evolution and of course where Alex ended up as a consequence of that but at least go Abbie.

Also, what is up with these low ratings, it's really uncalled for.",literal
"Great show...lots of bad technical issues OK Mr. Cinematographer. Or maybe your editor? Season 2 use of anamorphic lenses create a distorted view along with wacky tilt-shifty effect in some shots. If you're going to use anamorphics, at least don't make your audience feel like they're looking through a kaleidoscope while watching. Room edges and doors curve where they shouldn't. Clean it up.",literal
"Just a Gigalo Inside cozy theater #8, the one with Marilyn Monroe's photo by the entrance, only one other couple sits a few rows up eating popcorn.

I don't like war movies (I watched too many as a child), but I am curious: Nürnberg. And it pulls you right into the story. Then... several scenes with... ""Oh no, talking heads..."" But the dialogues are a sharp, gripping battle of minds. I forget I hate that format, because when the villain's intelligence rises far above the hero's, the scene becomes almost hypnotic.

And I love when a villain is human - not a mechanical monster of evil. Why not also show the Goebbels family? The mother placing the death pill in each child's mouth... Would that make it a documentary? Or a horror film?

I wish they wouldn't cut the 8 seconds from the Soviet prosecutor, Mr. Rudenko: ""Children were held in special camps, where typhus was deliberately spread as a method of extermination."" Or the 8 seconds of his speech: ""When a gang reaches exceptional proportions, when a gang finds itself in the center of the state apparatus, when a gang commits numerous and grave international crimes, then..."" Of course, in reality they don't cut anything - I'm just making fun of how completely American the movie feels, without even a single full sentence mentioning the Russians. At one point the word ""Russian"" is said, but the sound drops right there.

Forgive me if I compare the movie with ""Just a Gigolo"", with Marlene Dietrich singing... ""Just a Gigolo,"" In Nürnberg the whole world is Gigolo - stripped bare.

Later, I wait for my husband in the hall. The popcorn man - the man from the couple who watched the movie with me - comes out of the bathroom. I ask, ""Do you like the movie?"" He answers, ""Very emotional,"" his eyes glistening with tears.

I hesitate... and then I say it: ""My father was tortured to death in a German camp."" He pauses and answers softly, ""Sorry for your loss.""",literal
"Could have been truly good... ...but the truly awful soundtrack almost sinks this one for good. What is the obsession with saddling a period production with completely inappropriate and distracting score/songs? Another case of a director not trusting the material. Too bad, as this is well produced and acted. Turn off the sound and load subtitles if you want a good experience.",figurative
"Making it up as they go along? I like this series. I really do. But can't help feeling that they make it up as they go along. No consistency in the story telling. Maybe it's the raft of writers involved but character/plot development and character consistency just seems to be utterly lacking.

For example, Crowley was originally a kind of lovable baddie who gave Bobby his mobility back but by the end of series 8 he's the devil incarnate.

Great characters like Benny are introduced and then squandered like they don't know what to do with them. Garth is mentioned a million times more than he appears. It's so crap! Is it just down to a lack of forward planning/imagination/budget or what? Note to production team: Must do better!!",literal
"Shelby Oaks (2025) I have followed this film since it was first announced but by the time it came out, I was conflicted about seeing it because of the confusing up and down reviews that created some hesitation to see it. At first, I wasn't sure if I wanted to see it in theaters or wait for streaming, but I ignored the negative reviews and recently saw this and let me tell you - this movie took me by surprise. I'm honestly not even sure why some people rated it poorly but I went into this without any expectation. So let's get into it...

The story is about a young woman, Riley, who has a YouTube paranormal tv series and goes missing during filming an episode. Police have zero leads and the case goes cold. That is until a mysterious man shows up at Riley sister, Mia's house and commits suicide right in front of her leaving evidence of a video tape that she withholds from the police. Curious, Mia watches the found footage tape to find answers about her sister's disappearance, which turns into her discovering something sinister that traces back to their childhood. As Mia does research about Shelby Oaks and the last known location of where Riley was, she is determined to find her. What she encounters is what we as viewers see with a combination of watching past found footage and current events. This is where the eeriness begins.

The storyline is good, the ambiance is creepy and the execution holds your attention from beginning to end. As we got to the end, this felt like a sinister book, a dark story that I didn't want to end when it did. I wanted it to keep going. This is a solid film to watch in the dark, alone and ready to creep you out. I absolutely love this movie and am curious if there could be a prequel or a sequel. Maybe, maybe not but whether or not that happens, I rate this an 8.5-9/10 and will watch it again.

Ignore the bad reviews!",literal
"Yorgos Lanthimos' latest is a deconstruction of conspiracy theorists Yorgos Lanthimos has developed an idiosyncratic style, in the same way that Wes Anderson or Kelly Reichardt has. You can identify a Lanthimos film without knowing it's his, thanks to his use of absurdism, cynicism of humanity, and dark humor. He's found a particular muse in Emma Stone, who has now starred in his last five projects, most notably earning her second Oscar for Poor Things (2023). The two have partnered yet again in Lanthimos' latest: Bugonia (2025).

Bugonia is the story of biochemical CEO Michelle (Emma Stone) who is kidnapped by the conspiracy theorist Teddy (Jesse Plemons) and his naif and aloof cousin Don (Aidan Delbis). Teddy is convinced that Michelle and other society elites are an alien race hell-bent on destroying humanity and thus intends to extract a confession from Michelle.

Bugonia is a remake of the Korean film Save the Green Planet! (2003) and follows the original's plot closely. Yet, as with any Lanthimos film, the visual flair and style of the Greek director can't be contained, and he brings about a less melodramatic if equally quirky approach to the premise. Save the Green Planet! Was surprisingly prescient in the toxicity of conspiracy theories and the violence that they would go on to inspire within the social media world. Bugonia as a result feels incredibly prescient, even mirroring the plot to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer in 2020, which was cooked up by disaffected men, constantly online, believing they were patriots.

Yet it would be easy for the intellectual and Hollywood elite to look down and simply scold the dangers of conspiracy theorists, but Lanthimos does well to use his artform to explore these characters. He brings an empathy, alongside Will Tracy who adapted the screenplay, that allows us to see Teddy as a frustrated man within his decaying community. Teddy seeks a greater meaning and purpose for his life, and finds solace in believing he's a freedom fighter against an alien invasion. It's so much bleaker to simply believe that rural towns are dying off as manufacturing work moves abroad. Tracy and Lanthimos use Teddy and his desperate fantasy as a tragic frame of young men losing their sense of purpose.

The added complexity to the comfort of conspiracies is the way that gullible people are strung along to follow these beliefs. This is exemplified in Don, who is almost childlike in his innocence and admiration of his cousin, seeking his approbation and following him down the rabbit hole of the violent kidnapping. It showcases the layers of these naive people who become lost to the internet algorithm and follow along more in search of company and friendship.

Bugonia is a deconstruction of the extremist ideological shifts occurring within society; the kidnapped Michelle and Teddy cannot communicate with one another because they are living in completely separate plains of reality. It is a story of wits and gamesmanship, where Michelle is forced to think of ways to talk through the tangled logic of Teddy's world. It's a brilliant back and forth that keeps you in tension as to whether Michelle pushes to hard and risks a snap of violence.

One of Lanthimos' greatest virtues is also one of his biggest weaknesses: his penchant of pushing things to the limit. This approach can deliver the extraordinary and enlightening such as with The Favourite (2018) or Poor Things. But other times, you sense his love of style and shock overcome his loyalty to narrative and theme, repulsing viewers or inducing eyerolls such as with Dogtooth (2009) or Kinds of Kindness (2024). Bugonia straddles this fine line and nears the upper echelon of Lanthimos' risk-taking rewards, yet the finale - which to be fair follows the Korean original - simply goes too far in wanting to deliver a joke and troll viewers. It undoes the careful and balanced work that Lanthimos and Tracy had achieved in the rest of the film, instead jamming a twist for the sake of jolting viewers. It's something that felt inevitable with the provocative Greek, yet also a missed opportunity of restraint; cutting the last 10 minutes of Bugonia would have delivered a more solid and affecting film.

Stone and Lanthimos' collaborations have brought some of their best work. Stone has grown immensely as a performer, taking advantage of the breadth of freedom and challenges Lanthimos' style permits her, delivering the apotheotic performance of her career with Poor Things. In Bugonia, Stone delivers a more contained yet still fierce performance. She has to play both audience surrogate and show quick thinking and panic under an exterior of calm. The new collaborator that Lanthimos seems to be falling in love with is, however, is Plemons, who he first worked with in Kinds of Kindness. Plemons is an astounding actor who gives 110% in any film he's in, whether it's a cameo, supporting role, or a lead in a goofy movie. His is an intensity and commitment that frequently make him the standout in any project he's in. He's no different in Bugonia, showing Teddy's insecurity, wrath, and blind belief bursting forth at the same time. At times we see him become a child (literally in some flashbacks), as his doubts make him become small, and then within a second, he snaps into a violent cult leader that makes you tremble.

In the end, Bugonia is a complex deconstruction, alongside two spectacular performance, which delves into the conspiracy-laden world of today. Yet as with many of Lanthimos' works, he pushes the narrative too far with a finale that goofs and dilutes much of the hard work done previously. It takes away a lot of the emotional impact, yet also comforts viewers into showing that the Greek director's boldness and risk-taking will never be reined in.",literal
"Constant product placements drove me up a wall! Enjoyable series to which I would have given a 7 were it not for the constant -- and very obvious -- product placements. Here are a few, off the top of my head: Brooks Brothers, Rolex, Brita water filters, and Wordle. The constant ""name-dropping"" is very cheap and tacky, in my opinion.

The people behind this show are, I'm sure, well-compensated for this but they should resist the temptation of taking this easy money. It degrades the viewing experience which turns off viewers.

On the positive side, the series was entertaining, largely because of Ted Danson's great performance as an amateur sleuth.",literal
"Conspiracy Terrorists Yorgos Lanthimos has done it again.

A fascinating concept turned into a dark reflection of our modern society. The film presents highly unusual characters in an almost ordinary setting - or at least, it seems that way. The storyline resonates perfectly with today's conspiracy-driven culture, touching on themes of mental health... or perhaps not? That ambiguity is part of its brilliance. And I don't want to reveal too much.

The performances are outstanding. Emma Stone once again delivers a remarkable portrayal, proving she is at her best when working with Lanthimos. Jesse Plemons is equally impressive, playing completely against type.

With a fantastic score, striking cinematography, superb acting, and Lanthimos's masterful direction, the film builds toward an ending that lands like a big bang.",literal
Funny show! Give this show a few episodes to find its footing (like most shows). It's so funny imo. I really enjoy the characters and how relatable they are and how good they are at being funny. I don't know what else to say but give it a shot. I hope they keep it going and keep the funny coming. Enjoy the show.,literal

"Black phone 2 with a twist of elm street A fairly strong sequel. Scott Derrickson once again delivered his impressive directional work especially with the camera and cinematography and the very graphic dreamy sequences, which were visually striking and very effective and sometimes graphic.

Theres a lot of depth and authenticity in some of the movie's sequences While at times some of the dialogue felt a little uneven and giving off a very nightmare on elm street vibe.

The film was a different approach to the first one Black phone 2 slightly exceeded my expectations I didn't know what to expect but I liked the plot of this film I liked how the Grabber became the Grabber, and how they portrayed this story and how it was told but I felt like they could've delved more deeper into it that it could of made it a better sequel.

But it just didnt hit the same way as the first one did. I went into the movie theatre expecting the same depth, emotion, and mystery,etc but sadly it didnt quite deliver that same impact as Black phone did back in 2021.",literal
"Great show overall I gave it a 9/10 for the first 4 seasons ,really good show. But the first episode of season five gived me game of thrones vibes; What kind of monkey wrote the script??? How can Monica be 9 months pregnant, when they explicitly telled more than 2 times in season 4 that the governor elections are in 2 years, and she remains pregnant before one of those scenes. 1/10 hope the rest of season five isnt as trash as the first episode, but man they messed it up already. Full of nonsense episodes. And i really hope they give a pair of balls to my boy Jamie untill the end of the season 5, because oh boy i'd shoot Beth in the face.",literal
"Lorelei is sickening I'm in season 4 episode 9. Lorelei is the sixteen year old, entitled, airhead who never grew up. She's childish (not in a cute way), self centered, obvious, disrespectful to her mom, and clueless to others and their feelings. For a grown woman to be this childish every day is a problem . She plays too much and dismisses what others ask her NOT to do. It's not her bubbly personality that's a problem, it's her childishness. She doesn't seem to have mental issues. She's childish and it's sickening. I was going to wait to review this show, but this character is all of the things I mentioned above. Rory is entitled too. Her tree!!?? Get some manners and realize the world does not revolve around you. I know this is fiction, but people usually write based on some life experiences. I hope there is not a grown woman in the world who acts this way. I love Sookie and Emily (Lorelei's mommy). Maybe Lorelei does have mental issues.",literal
"Godawful mess Not terrible, not good. Not funny, not dramatic. From the school of ""shout a bit more and maybe people will laugh"". Occassionally absurdist then suddenly serious.

"Enjoyable,but The Story Falls Flat, The Running Man is a good movie with an average story,but still a very strong performance from Arnold Schwarzenegger,an actor that can make anything he's in enjoyable.The movie has a lot of great action sequences,but it relies way too much on action and not enough on story,something I find to be the most important part of a movie,the movie begins with a promising story,but once Ben is sent onto the show,it's just him fighting against people for about an hour twenty minutes.Schwarzenegger had a lot of very clever lines in this movie,but I really didn't like when he said 'i'll be back', it was a very stupid nod to Terminator,and the way Arnold said was very fake,because he knew it was a reference.Fans of Arnold Schwarzenegger will enjoy his performance and his clever one liners,but there is a huge absence of story in this movie.

"Painfully boring and shockingly amateur This is one of the most boring movies I've seen in the last 10 years.

Almost nothing happens, and when it does, it feels random and pointless.

The story is told in such a confusing way that you don't feel curious or intrigued, just tired and disconnected. The weird cuts and jumps between scenes don't add mystery, they just make the film look messy and badly edited.

The whole movie feels like an amateur student project, not like a serious cinema release. The acting is flat, the characters have no real personality, and there is no chemistry between them. Most of the time, the actors just walk, stare, mumble a few lines and repeat the same emotions again and again. There is almost no tension, no real fear, no payoff. For something sold as ""horror"", it is incredibly dull.

By the time the film finally gives a bit of explanation near the end, it's already too late. It doesn't save anything, it just proves that the idea was weak and badly executed from the beginning.

To be honest, if this is the best the director and producers can do, they should seriously think about leaving this field and doing something else. This kind of movie doesn't just waste the audience's time, it makes the film world look bad.

2/10 - boring, amateur, and absolutely not worth a cinema ticket.",literal
"Funny premise, funny writing, funny acting This show, like most of Tim Robinson's work (Detroiters in particular), is not only absurdly funny but also surprisingly feel-good and well-directed. I love its premise, and the mystery is genuinely intriguing. I'm glad HBO trusted Tim with this project; it has so many laugh-out-loud moments, and it's far less cringe than his earlier shows. It strikes a near-perfect balance of comedy and heart, and I have high expectations for where it goes next.",literal
"A really bad holiday movie. What a waste of money, Netflix must have money to burn. Guess they don't have reps who actually read scripts anymore, this one must have been green lit based on 'good vibs'. Netflix normally funds better quality films, like last years Christmas movie ""Our Little Secret"". That film was well written and had a great cast and it was very funny.

Whoever wrote this script doesn't understand humor or how to write it. And the actors don't make it funny. Holiday films are competitive so I can watch better ones or I can just rewatch ""Our Little Secret"", their hit from last year.",literal

"Finaly, some good f&£*%ng adult animated show When i first saw the poster of that show, immediately in my head was like: great another adult swim sh💩y show incoming.

But then after watching the whole 1st episode i actually wanted to see another. And after watching the entire season i rewatched it.

The show has unique artstyle, characters, and story. The jokes are surprisingly good. They are not trying hard to throw every possible edgy joke they can think in our faces. Some character desgins look ridiculous and bizzare and they were funny and i wasnt disgusted by it, for example mr. Frog who looks like it was drawned by pre-schooler but at same time looks good and its original which i can say for the artstyle of this show.

I hope this show gets season 2. :)",literal
"A fun ride, but something's missing This is an interesting concept, surely not a genre played out much in Hollywood. The cast is jam packed with all stars giving great (but not their best) performances. The missing piece of the puzzle? Character development. 

That's not to say that there is any lack of interesting characters, each of the four horsemen bring a very unique style to the movie (besides Henley, she's rather weak as a character), and the sheer amount of Talent present in each scene guarantees that you'll be entertained. 

10/10? Hardly. But definitely a solid 8 for me. Entertaining, fun, and definitely a concept worth exploring on the big screen. Just remember, the closer you look, the less you'll actually see.",literal
"Four magicians commit three 'impossible' crimes In the opening scenes of this heist film we are introduced to four magicians; Danny Atlas, a street magician who entertains people with card tricks; Merritt McKinney, a hypnotist who uses his skills to blackmail people; Henley Reeves, an escapologist and Jack Wilder another street magician who uses his tricks to distract people while stealing their wallets. We see each of them perform a trick then find a tarot card; the messages on the cards bring them together in a New York apartment. Who brought them together is a mystery but one year later the four of them are putting on a show in Las Vegas under the name 'The Four Horsemen'. Here they perform an apparently impossible trick they use a member of the audience to rob a bank on the other side of the world! FBI Agent Dylan Rhodes is soon on the case alongside Alma Dray, a French Interpol agent. They are also being followed by Thaddeus Bradley, a former magician who now debunks other people's tricks. Their next trick involves emptying the bank account of their sponsor, millionaire Arthur Tressler and putting the cash into the accounts of the audience. After this they announce one more spectacular event which will take place in New York.

If you are looking for anything vaguely realistic then this isn't the film for you. Like many heist movies we are invited to sympathise with the criminals; not only are they likable it is made clear that the victims of their tricks a getting what they deserve. The pace is fast enough for us not to worry too much about just how implausible it really is. The cast, which includes some well-known stars, do a solid job and work well together. Like most good magic tricks this film relies on misdirection; while the viewers are concentrating on the Four Horsemen and trying to figure out how they are committing their crimes and how they will evade the authorities they won't be thinking about who is behind their operation and even if you are thinking about it suspicion is pointed at several possible characters and it obviously isn't anybody too likely. Overall I'd say that this is a fun, inoffensive heist movie that passes a couple of hours nicely.",literal
"Absolutely baffling Honestly, this show is what I always wanted out of IT. So far the essence of IT is captured better in this show than in the original adaptations.

"Top Anerican Medical Series The Pitt is simply amazeballs! I love everything about it. The more mature cast outshines everyone else, as they should. The younger cast play their roles just as they should: inexperienced, very talented, and also too full of themselves, given the circumstances. The writing is spot on, and the amazing newer equipment blows me away. I am not a medical series junkie and never have been until now. I didn't even recognize Noah Wyle at the beginning but am absolutely in love with this gem of a show. Smart, heartfelt, and phenomenal. Kudos to the cast, writers, crew, and producers! Britbox's Casualty is also this good, but previous seasons-MANY-are not available to watch in the U. S.",figurative
"Exciting and Emotional Stranger Things, a fantastic and emotional series, plays with your feelings and when you least expect it, something shocking happens, leaving you with the feeling of seeing the next episode.

The first chapter: The Vanishing of Will Byers is boring and leaves you with the feeling that this series is not as exciting as everyone says, but if you give episode 2 a chance, it immediately grabs you.

Although it has some moments where nothing important happens, they are just preparing you for the big moment, the end of each episode leaves you speechless.

Its monsters are disturbing and grotesque, and season 4 surpassed the previous ones in brutality and left fans impatient for volume 2.

Each character is unique and you either immediately love or hate them, but don't get too attached a great series that I hope has a good ending, I hope that STRANGER THINGS 5 is as good as the other 4 seasons.",literal
"Best show on TV I saw an ad for this series and didn't think I would like it. And it turned out it has the most brilliant pilot in my opinion. I love the subtle, undertone jokes. The drama is quite real, unlike, soap-opera ""grey's anatomy."" You get enough taste of every character and the things that nurses would have to deal with their job. I think the script is brilliantly written. If you expect typical hospital drama, you may not like this show. The humor is off-beat and quirky. This is the only show that I eagerly wait each week. Great characters and casts. I just wish the episodes are longer than 30 minutes and more than 10/12 episodes a season. I'm a big fan.",literal
"A lot of fun Utkarsh Ambudkar and Rose McIver star as a yuppie couple from the Big Apple who inherit a mansion that's inhabited by eight ghosts of different eras. There's a Viking who grunts a lot; a Native American; an effeminate Revolutionary War captain; a 19th Century schoolmarm with aristocratic roots; a sassy flapper from the Prohibition Era; a flower child who is permanently tripping through the afterlife; a square scout leader from the 80s; and a Wall Street playboy from the 90s. The octet makes for a brilliantly strange found family of people whose only commonality is that they died in the the same spot -- seemingly all of them in comic ways.

Before the arrival of Sam, the ghosts simply had little choice but to entertain each other and passively experience the house's occupants. However, when Sam has a near death experience, the ghosts are suddenly able to communicate with her and suddenly the living and dead residents of the house have to renegotiate a living arrangement between them.

While there might not be a clear stand-out character among the ghost crew, the contrasts and dynamics between them add up to making them more than the sum of their parts. This a clever premise that's executed with just the right light-hearted tone. There's a certain urgency stemming from the couple's financial uncertainty regarding their plan that adds some stakes but mostly it's a lot of fun.",literal
"WOW First of all, at first I thought it was going to be a ""Next Generation"" kind of season. Then I thought it was going to be like how it was with each episode being a separate case.. but it was so much more than that!! I really love how they switched things up and gave the BAU a case to really sit and dwell on for a whole season. What makes it even better was that although they were focused on one suspect there were still many cases being solved in between adding variety and multiple focuses. I didn't give it 10 stars only because I was hoping and wishing they would have been able to get back a little bit more of the original BAU heavy hitters like Reid.",literal
"Ghosts: A Charming and Hilarious Haunting If you're looking for a show that's equal parts heartwarming and hilarious, Ghosts is a must-watch. This series blends comedy, supernatural intrigue, and surprisingly touching moments to create something truly special.

The premise is refreshingly unique: a young couple moves into a crumbling estate, only to discover it's inhabited by a quirky group of ghosts from different eras. Each ghost has their own distinct personality and backstory, which leads to endless comedic situations and heartfelt revelations.

What I love most about Ghosts is its brilliant writing and ensemble cast. The chemistry between the living and the dead is perfect, and the humor strikes a balance between witty, silly, and sometimes downright absurd. But beneath the laughs, there's a surprising emotional core that explores themes of love, loss, and connection.

The show's ability to make you laugh out loud one moment and tear up the next is what keeps me coming back for more. It's lighthearted without being shallow, and the characters feel like old friends after just a few episodes.

I'd rate Ghosts a glowing 10/10. It's a rare gem that appeals to fans of comedy, supernatural stories, and heartfelt drama alike. Whether you're binging it alone or with family, it's a hauntingly good time that you won't want to miss.",figurative

In some examples it's similar with parts of plot and narration, and show doesn't rush to explain itself.

"season 3 was a stretch but season 4 is train wreck Seasons 1-2 were written very well. The entire series should have ended after 2nd season. Season 3 was a stretch to keep it in the building. Hard to believe the bad luck but the ship stayed a float. Season 4 was a disaster from the start. Like a Super bowl winning quarterback coming out of retirement only to fail miserably with a losing season. But to try and keep this ship from sinking they bring in a bunch at A-list actors. This does NOT help. It actually makes it very very painful to watch. You can tell all of the actors are bored with the entire script. Molly Shannon failed at bringing any humor to this disaster. Her over acting and improv was just plan sad. Zach Galifianakis was weak sauce. Don't get me started on Melissa McCarthy. I would rather be forced to drag my fingernails across a chalkboard then to have see her attempt to be funny. The joy of seeing Martin, Steve and Selena come together in season 1 was completely destroyed halfway through season 3.",figurative
"Nothing else like it Excellent show!!! It's such a well cast series with quality acting and believable characters. There really isn't anything else like it around at the moment. The beach ocean vibes throughout the show is really unique and encapsulating.

The flashbacks in the last series are some of the best you will see, maybe a bit overdone in earlier seasons but wow it fits so well in the final season. It becomes quite impactful and very sad, helps set why they are ultimately to blame for the situation the find themselves in and why Smurf is a terrible person. The flashbacks MAKE the final series very very clever and each of the actors is soooo convincing as their younger selves. The casting for the older and younger Pope is so well done very believable, Julia is also a great actor. I like it features a gay main actor but it doesn't have to ever be so central to his identify so as to overtake the whole narrative of his story yet still seems to acknowledge it enough. More of this please, regular characters who are gay and that's that.

The final episode is quite emotional if you have been watching for since the start. Manages to tie in the whole storyline since the very first episode of the first series which a lot of series can't seem to ever get right. It sets it up for a very heavy finale. Why do so many shows never get this right.

I give it a 9 instead of a 10 only due to some of the heists are a bit unrealistic.

Overall really great show, nothing else like it. Highly recommend. Very sad to see it go and a shame that for some reason we can't get more unique shows like this that are very character driven.",literal
"Thirsty For Season 2 'House of Guinness' successfully navigates a tricky path. It would have been very easy to cross over from drama to soap opera, but this series does not. I also don't care that they have invented some characters, Sean Rafferty (James Norton), or fudged dates. This is not a documentary.

The acting is quite good with Anthony Boyle (Arthur Guinness) being particularly strong. Also, Jack Gleeson (Byron Hedges), Michael McElhatton (Potter), Niamh McCormack (Ellen Cochrane) and Louis Partridge (Edward Guinness).

There are some unusual accents, but such is life. I look forward to Season 2.",literal
A hilarious time! I've been really excited for this film for a while and it seemed like a super fun premise with a great cast. I'll say this the film is just a ton of fun throughout its runtime and I was absolutely dying with some of the comedy throughout the film. I was also excited to see Aziz Ansari and his directing debut and I think he did a great job and he was also hilarious in this film as well for the most part. My favorite part of the film has to be Seth Rogen and Keanu's Reeves character chemistry throughout the film and they are absolutely hilarious together and both deliver great comedic performances here. I also found the relationship between Aziz Ansari's character and Keke Palmers character to be alright but I wish they would've expanded on it some more and felt like they were rushing this dynamic in the film. Obviously the comedy here is great there's so many great and hilarious jokes throughout the movie which just had me dying throughout the movie as well. The story is good as well for the most part and I really like the story they are telling here of how rough this world has made it for people to even scrap by and how many struggles so many people have to go through just to get by. The writing here does feel a little off at times though and some moments just fly by for no reason and I wish this movie would've expanded more on some things instead of just going by super fast paced. I also think. I also think the movie was a little too short for me as there's so many interesting things they have here like I would've loved to see more. But overall this movie is a hilarious time and I know it'll have some people absolutely dying of laughter in this film.,literal

This rendition of Wednesday shows a bit more feeling than I had expected, wich threw me off at first, but it ended up working out well with the story.

The plot and the atmosphere overall is excellent, it is dark, twisted, and comical. On top of that, it was great to watch a show in wich the ending wasn't painfully obvious right from the start. They threw in some nice twists and turns.",literal
"""It"" shows flare, but needs to have more confidence in it's ability to scare. ""It"" is a mostly successful horror film that, unlike it's peers, manages to easily surpass the quality of it's predecessor (although it did have a slight luxury in being a remake of a TV film). Surprisingly enough, the film's biggest issue arises in the confidence of the film to allow itself to scare the audience.

Fortunately the film manages to stay standing in spite of itself. A large part of this is due to the casting of the child actors and the antagonist, Pennywise. For the most part these kids are believable in their roles even when they have to read through some clunky King dialogue. Only a few times do their performances feel hammy, the most notable being a painful but short exchange between Ben and Bev during the third act. The kids also play the comic relief of the film well in their dialogue. Although the film does push the comedic limit sometimes, especially a bit that referenced 'New Kids on the Block' that felt like it belonged in a tripe PG-13 comedy. Otherwise the only other shortcoming in the characters is the criminally underwritten role of Mike. I feel for Chosen Jacobs who did really well with what sparse material they gave that character.

I can't really add anything about Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise, it's everything that it's been built up to be. 

I also appreciated that the film had some cinematic shots as well. Too often directors in horror forget how crucial framing a shot can be. Fortunately ""It"" does not forget this and I actually remembered a few specific shots the day after watching the film. One particular shot I enjoyed was a dutch angle shot from the perspective of a painting, the character in the frame straightens the literal frame and by extension the actual shot as well.

While I praise the film for those shots, I have to acknowledge the gigantic pitfall of the film.

Obnoxiously loud stings during every single scare.

""It"" is filled with many disturbing and scary visuals. However, the film insults your intelligence by fishing for a jump scares with abhorrent sound cues. So much more could've been accomplished with appropriate ambient music, or sounds to really let the fear and unease creep into the audience instead of essentially yelling ""Boo!"". This was very unfortunate as even in a theatre with a full audience, only once did a single person scream during the entire film.

Jump scares aren't uncommon in horror, but this film was strong enough to stand on it's own without resorting to such trite measures.

As a result the film finds itself being just good, instead of great.",figurative

"A decent feel-good procedural with potential /Refers to Seasons 1-3/

This Series is the kind of show that comfortably sits between heartfelt drama and pulpy procedural. Starring Justin Hartley as Colter Shaw, a modern-day MacGyver-meets-reward-hunter, it follows his travels across the U. S. as he uses survival and tracking skills to find missing people (sometimes pets) with each episode presenting a new case, with his own past haunting throughout the episodes.

What makes Tracker work is its simplicity. It doesn't reinvent the genre, but it offers a comforting, often wholesome experience that many viewers find refreshing. Hartley, known for his role in This Is Us, brings enough charisma and emotional depth to elevate the sometimes formulaic script. He carries the show, even when the writing stumbles.

The tone often swings from ""biblical respect"" for the protagonist's noble mission to ""good cringe""-corny but oddly charming. It's a low-stakes, low-stress watch that functions best when you need something easy and emotionally warm. There are flashes of real potential, especially in episodes with stronger writing or when supporting actors inject new energy.

However, the Series includes some shortcomings. Some characters-especially Shaw's tech-savvy team-lack development, and occasional plot holes or unrealistic conveniences (like magically acquired intel or left documents) weaken the realism. It also occasionally drifts into tonal awkwardness or preachy messaging. Still, Tracker manages to entertain. It may not be prestige TV, but it's sincere, accessible, and has a heart. With tighter writing and more character depth, it could easily level up in future seasons (Season 3 ended in an intriguing manner).",literal
"Costner is a seasoned Cowboy I thoroughly enjoyed this premier. Mr. Costner is Lt. Dunbar, Wyatt Earp and Charley Waite all in one. I like his character and I enjoy watching his cowboy experience play this role. 

I totally appreciate the story line, ruthless at times but I can see John Dutton fiercely protect what he has and wants. The Dutton Family is strong and you can tell they share dad's passion, even in the youngest son. 

Yes, it reminded me of Longmire in many ways. I just hope the series is just as good as the premier and that it doesn't drag out and get ruined. I enjoyed Longmire, but the ending left something to be desired for me. Hope the end results are better in this new-era Cowboy show.",literal
"CRINGY.... but The first episode kicks off a bit cringy, with that classic background music that screams ""another one of those shows."" At first, you might think, ""Ugh, not this again."" The characters give off major ""House"" and ""The Doctor"" vibes, you know, the ""misunderstood genius"" trope. But as the episode rolls on, it's clear there's more to it.

We get to see a single mom juggling her own struggles while trying to connect with her team. Plus, her partner actually seems to support her rather than act like a jerk, which is a nice change.

Love the style of this show. Production takes in the recreation scenes look unique.

Overall, I'm curious to see how the rest of the season unfolds!",figurative
Not A Romcom Sad depressing melodramatic melancholy movie with wrong modern day portrayals. Very little comedy and almost a bit scary especially some of the subject matter which was quite sad. I can't think of a particular time or generation on this type of romantic activity would have been common or normal. Also substandard acting and directing.,literal
"Has potential Work place sitcoms are always tricky when starting out. The first several episodes are devoted to establishing who and what the characters are: the goofy one, the level headed one, the jaded one, etc. DMV definitely follows this formula. It has potential, Tim Meadows is a seasoned comedy pro and I am a big fan of Harriet Dyer (I am bummed American Auto got canceled. She was great in that). Hopefully the writing will improve and the actors will grow in their roles. A less frantic pace would help. DMZ is worth a shot to see if it grows into a good, fun, quirky workplace comedy.",literal
"I do not regret Regretting You is a surprisingly emotional and beautifully told story about family, love, and forgiveness. It's filled with heartfelt moments that feel honest and real, and it shows how complicated relationships can be - especially when love and loss collide.

We have this guy from The Black Phone in it, and he does an amazing job here too! It's really cool seeing him in a totally different kind of role - more grounded, emotional, and mature. Anyways, the whole cast delivers incredible performances that make every scene believable and touching.

The direction and pacing are excellent, keeping the story engaging from start to finish. The cinematography gives the movie a warm, nostalgic tone, and the soundtrack fits perfectly with the film's emotional rhythm.

It's one of those movies that quietly pulls you in and stays with you long after it ends.

NOT REGRETTING MYSELF FROM WATCHING THIS MOVIE... okay that was kinda cringe.",literal
"Just another biproduct of a pathetic plastic culture. Im glad this movie didnt take itself seriously, thats the only part I liked about this movie.

If you are a 13 year old boy, you might like this movie, and thats cool. But If you are older and are getting just a little tired of all the crap, the media, (and the world around us) has the guts to throw at us, then you shouldnt watch this movie.

Its bad, its real bad. But not that bad if you just turned on the TV on a sunday afternoon and have nothing else to do.

In the end, this is what there is most of in our world today. The consumers decides what the media throws at us, and when the majority of the consumers are in fact, young or shallowminded youngsters, this is what we get.

People this is just another biproduct of a pathetic plastic culture.

"Some odd choices at the start might spoil a fun actioner The spineless brian is a tough thing to sit through when it's ball aching cringe, cliche and frankly feels like lazy writing for a slow open before the proverbial shid hit's the fan after 20 ish mins.

It was a sily idea and should have been silly through out but forced drama with theartircal drama music was just wrong.",literal
"Great series and worth watching! The Last Samurai Standing pulled me in right away. I planned to watch one episode and ended up finishing the whole thing without even realizing how much time had passed. The cinematography is the first thing that really stood out. Some of the shots are so sharp and immersive that it almost feels like you are standing in the scene with the characters. The way the camera moves during the action, and even in the quieter moments, gives the series a really grounded and atmospheric feel.

The action is strong without being overdone. Every fight is clean and easy to follow, and there is a weight to it that keeps you invested. The characters add a lot too. Each one has a distinct presence, and they all contribute something different without crowding the story. The show also does a good job capturing the tension of a changing Japan without drifting into heavy exposition.

Overall, it is the combination of visuals, pacing, and character work that makes this series hard to stop watching. It feels polished, intense, and genuinely engaging from start to finish. If they continue this series, there is definitely more here worth exploring.",figurative
"Clair Danes I like Claire Danes, but I feel like everything she's in. She's always mad.

"It's a show that wears you out with its pace. The show is just pure chaos-fast, blurry shots with loud music and dark lighting.

The plot's weak: a couple of brothers get mixed up with some mobsters. It's one of those series that makes you want to quit halfway through, but you keep watching hoping it'll get better.

Sadly, it doesn't. I feel bad for Jude Law-he's a great actor. Bateman's fine too, but his character gets old fast with the same loser, troubled vibe.

The rest of the cast? Just boring, mostly because they keep making dumb decisions over and over.",figurative
"Its just romantic A delightful, witty romance that will capture your heart! 'Love in Doubt' masterfully navigates the complexities of interfaith relationships, family expectations, and personal identity.

As the agnostic sex podcaster and the newly single rabbi navigate their whirlwind romance, they must confront their own biases, traditions, and meddling families. Will their love be strong enough to overcome their differences?

This film is a beautiful, nuanced exploration of love, acceptance, and identity. With its lighthearted tone, relatable characters, and heartfelt story, 'Love in Doubt' is a must-watch for anyone who believes in the power of love. So, grab some tissues, get cozy, and enjoy this delightful romantic movie.",literal
"An impressive series, chilling and informative. This series looks at the life and crimes of Jeffrey Dahmer, his early years, failed jobs, crimes and victims.

I worried early on that it was going to feel long, or stretched out, ten episodes is quite stretch, it wasn't, at no point was this slow or underdeveloped.

An incredibly chilling watch, it doesn't hold back, it puts you very close to the action, physically and mentally, you'll be left with strong options of Dahmer, and his hideous crimes.

You'll get an idea as to why Dahmer chose the victims that he did, and you'll have an idea as to why he got away with things for so long.

It doesn't follow a straight line, it moves backwards and forwards through Dahmer's life as it progresses, but it does make sense, and it really is cohesive.

Best episode for me was Tony's story, he was the most developed of the victims, you felt his dreams, ambitions and hopes, only to see them dashed by Dahmer.

Great cast, superb acting, it truly is a PowerPoint performance from Evan Peters, he's phenomenal.

9/10.",literal
"Lame version of Nice Guys From what I've seen so far this seems like a rejiggle of The Nice Guys, but without the partnership.

"Fallout TV Show Excellently made and done tv show. We have the Vaultdweller Lucy who is surprisingly good character. She learns and grows, while trying to stay true to ideals with the ""Golden Rule"". Similar is with Maximus, only in his case, he is more aware of the true state of the world in general, and more into survival and opportunity. And we have The Ghoul and Cooper Howard, both similar and different characters played by the same actor, who with the over two centuries presence, connect the past and the present..

"Like a Vegas Show, Entertaining but Lacking of Much Else Imagine Now You See Me as Ocean's Eleven meets The Prestige and you sort of get what director Louis Leterrier was going for with this film. Is Now You See Me as successful as the aforementioned films? Not necessarily, but it's a fun movie that deconstructs the acts of modern magicians.

The story follows four Vegas magicians, known as the Four Horsemen, who rob a bank in the middle of one of their shows. What follows is a cat-and-mouse thriller where the FBI chases after these magicians, always one step behind, trying to figure out how they did it.

Where Now You See Me works best is when Leterrier creates cinematic sequences showing us how these magicians used real-life magic tricks to befuddle and dupe both their victims and the FBI. As well, if you want a film with twists and turns, this one will not disappoint. While most of the major twists can be found out before revealed, there is still a joy in watching those twists unfold, thanks to Leterrier's Sherlock Holmes' style of visual deduction. However, the script often falters in one of the most crucial areas, that of character.

Leterrier and company are constantly trying to balance the breakneck pace with the large cast of characters, and it just leaves the characters hanging out to dry. Character development is sorely lacking in Now You See Me, to where I never really cared about any of the characters. Part of this is because the film is constantly shifting points of view. The first thirty minutes follow our Robin Hood-like magicians, and then it switches to the FBI agents tracking them down, but then the film has the magicians constantly one step in front of the FBI to the point that it makes the FBI often come across as buffoons, and I find it hard to care for characters who are so easily fooled. Ultimately, I feel that had the film focused entirely on one set of characters, like the magicians or the FBI, the film would have been stronger and been easier to find a focal point, but as it is the film's core is often muddled.

While Now You See Me may not be a grand slam, it's still entertaining, thanks to the thrills and visual style of the film. Bottom line, if you're a fan of the heist genre, you'll like this movie. For me though, it just lacks a further script rewrite to have become one of the best examples of the genre.

I give Now You See Me an 8 out of 10!",literal
"Very interesting story with a super cast One of the better historical mini series I have seen and impressive strong cast.

"One of the best shows on TV - must watch! The best part about SVU is that each episode has it's own unique style and can range from political to religious, personal to international and by no means at all do you have to wait until the season finale for an amazing episode. Episodes range from their worst as good television to their best as absolutely phenomenal. The dramatic writing is great (the comedic usually consists of not-so-subtle puns and one-liners, but that's to be expected), and the acting is prime: Olivia and Elliot are a powerhouse duo and Hargitay and Meloni play them with passion and purpose. I'm surprised they haven't won more awards than they already have. Supporting characters and guest actors are consistently great too.

Even though its in its 11th season, the stories are still new and exciting and must be watched!",literal

"Amusement and Pleasure The wish dream of every nerdy kid in America came true when John Hughes brought out Weird Science for the movie going public. Just imagine being able to create via a computer a Kelly LeBrock for your own amusement and pleasure. 

That's what Anthony Michael Hall and Ilan Mitchell Smith do on his PC. Remember personal computers at the time were still fairly new and it wasn't everyone who had one. So at Smith's home the guys create a perfect woman in a virtual world. But some crossed wires bring Kelly LeBrock to life in their world. Those same crossed wires also bring about some other things in Weird Science.

In the supporting cast some credit has to go to Bill Paxton playing the older brother to Smith, a jock/ROTC type straight from some military school who torments the younger.Smith and takes his own pleasure in it. What LeBrock and her magic circuits do to him is screamingly funny. Let's say his inner self finally bursts forth.

After 30 years this brat pack comedy is still very funny.",literal
"Cheesy, prophetic, and classic! The Running Man is often dismissed as being just another Arnie action thriller full of explosions, bad puns and gunfire, and to be fair, there is a lot of that in it. People used to look at it and compare it to the Terminator series, saying it was one of the poorer Schwarzenegger films.

But, give it 18 years, and you find yourself being able to appreciate it in a different light. Rather than just being another brainless action film, it works very well as a parody of reality TV. It is quite different to the Stephen King book, true, but I doubt whether Hollywood, with its love of upbeat endings and so-called 'ordinary guys' who turned out to have the skills of a trained commando, would have accepted it in its current form.

But, on with the review.

Ben Richards (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a cop working in a dystopian United States where democracy is a thing of the past, and the entire country is ruled by a government/media conglomerate amalgamation. The economy is in tatters, food is scarce and the state keeps people distracted by producing sadistic gameshows for them to watch, like Jumping for Dollars, where people jump for money over a pit of rabid dogs, and the most popular one is The Running Man, a gameshow hosted by the slimy Damian Killian (played by the entertaining Richard Dawson) where supposed 'criminals' are hunted down by theatrical, pro-wresting-esquire 'stalkers'.

Some, however, try and speak up against the government. When a group of hungry people hold a protest in the town of Bakersfield, California, a helicopter piloted by Richards is sent to 'calm' (i.e. kill) the protest. When Richards refuses to fire on innocent people, he is arrested and framed for the murder of the people in the crowd. He is sentenced to a slave labour camp, but escapes with the aid of a resistance leader (Yaphet Kotto) and goes on the run.

However, his freedom does not last long, and after he kidnaps network employee Amber Mendez (Marita Conchita Alonso) in an attempt to escape those pursuing him, he finds himself taken prisoner again, but this time he is forced to appear on The Running Man.

And there, of course, the entire film kicks into standard Arnie mode. Richards is launched into the post-apocalyptic wasteland of Los Angeles (why is LA always destroyed in these dystopian worlds?) and forced to run from the 'stalkers', along with two other prisoners who escaped from the labour camp with him. Amber also becomes curious about Richards' protestations of innocence, and discovers he was framed. Guess what happens to her, then? So, as Amber, Richards and the two other guys run around trying to avoid the stalkers, we soon become aware that Richards is no ordinary cop. He's Super Arnie, the unkillable one man army who can collapse evil corporate dictatorships and fight obese men covered in Christmas lights all while being just your average American guy with an Austrian accent.

Yes, the remainder of the film becomes dumb, loud, classic 80's Arnie fun. There's a lot of exciting fight sequences, the trademark dreadful puns ('He had to split' being my favourite), and the general formulaic final confrontation and happy ending. It's a lot of fun watching Killian react to it in the typical 'wholesome' gameshow host way, as well, and some of the funniest moments in the show revolve around the contrast between his interactions with the crowd as the seemingly benevolent host (watch out for the cursing old lady!) and the cold, cyncial man he is in reality who will do anything to increase ratings.

If you expect a high-brow, intelligent film, you'll be disappointed. But if you want a great 80s flick, well, this is it. But the great thing about this film is it was quite prophetic.

If you look at the entertainment we have today, you'll have noticed the way reality TV is going nowadays - shows featuring people willing to put themselves through anything for five minutes of fame, and producers all too willing to let them humiliate themselves on TV. It's not too far a leap to imagine that some vile TV exec out there has been trying to get the right to show people be executed live on TV. We've already had that, however, with the ghoulish al-Qaida hostage beheading videos posted on the internet. It seems that in the current climate, at least some people are perfectly fine with watching real death on their television sets.

With that in mind, and coupled with the fact that everything these days appears to be a revival of the 80s, you have to be impressed by the far-sightedness of this film. Of course, we haven't reached there yet, as it's terrorists, rather than the mainstream media, who have bought us easily available programs featuring real human death, but you just have to wonder how long it is before some exec decides to see if he can find a way of pitching a show that combines people's desire for entertainment and desire to indulge their morbid curiosity...",literal
"A Very Good Thriller with an Unsatisfying Ending Whether you're talking about The Hurt Locker, Detroit, or even Point Break, there's no denying that Kathryn Bigelow is a powerhouse director. With A House of Dynamite, she brings her signature intensity to a high-stakes thriller that doesn't waste a second. The premise is deceptively simple: a missile is heading for the U. S., and the government has 19 minutes to respond. That ticking clock gives the film a relentless pace that's as gripping as anything in Bigelow's filmography.

What sets this movie apart is its unique narrative structure. The film replays the same 19 minutes three times, each from a different perspective: Military, political, and civilian. This approach reveals new information with each iteration, gradually building a full picture getting to the decision-making in a national crisis. It's a clever device that kept me hooked, though I can see how the repetition and handheld camera style might wear thin for some.

The cast is stacked. Rebecca Ferguson, Idris Elba, Jared Harris, and Greta Lee (and many more) all deliver strong performances, but the structure limits how much time we spend with each character. Just as you start to connect with someone, the film shifts perspective. Still, the sharp dialogue and compelling performances help keep the stakes high, even if no single character fully anchors the story.

Where the film falters, for me, is in its final moments. The ending is clearly meant to provoke thought and debate, which I respect, but I found it unsatisfying. It felt more like a concept than a conclusion. That said, A House of Dynamite is a tightly made, ambitious thriller with standout direction and a really good score. It's absolutely worth watching, just be ready for an ending that might leave you frustrated.",literal

"It's better than the original Honestly, I never thought I would say that... about anything. It is though. I went to London on vacation, and I watched an entire season of the original show. It was funny, but I really did not like it that much. I thought it would be so much better, but it wasn't. All of the characters annoyed me to no end. With this version of The Office, I honestly cannot get enough of each character. I feel at home when I watch it, and all of the characters each have a unique place in my mind.

I am not dissing the original, because it's good. In my opinion, this version is so much better though. Before you judge this show though, watch a couple of episodes. Many people just watch one episode and write obnoxious comments on it. That is so retarded.

At least watch more than one episode. I watched an entire season of the British one before I judged it.",literal
"Brilliant concept realized Like Westworld and Game of Thrones in that a truly original story and brilliant casting, acting, sets and locations combine for a completely satisfying experience. The end may possibly not equal the lead up, like the previously mentioned shows, but the enjoyment of something this well crafted is precious. Too many quickly produced content made for theaters and streaming are pale copies of similar fare to fill the 24/7 audience consumption. Sometimes a gem like this falls through the cracks of mediocrity and reminds us what quality entertainment can be.

"Hollywood has been Stuckmannized. Shelby Oaks (2025) is a supernatural horror mystery movie directed by YouTuber Chris Stuckmann in his feature directorial debut with a screenplay co-written by Chris and his wife Samantha Elizabeth and it follows the story of a woman's obsessive search for her missing sister leads her into a terrifying mystery at the hands of an unknown evil. This was one of my most anticipated movies of 2025 because of Chris Stuckmann, who is one of the big pioneers for movie reviewers on YouTube alongside Jeremy Jahns, so I wanted to see what he could do with this movie and root for him as a fellow YouTuber. Well, I just got done watching the movie and while it wasn't a flawless victory, this was a great directorial debut for Mr. Stuckmann.

Positives for Shelby Oaks (2025): First off, I love the fact that a YouTuber like Chris Stuckmann got the chance to make a movie and seeing what he can do behind the camera. I will say that the filmmaking here is amazing especially given this movie having a budget of under $3 million and it has no right being as good as it is. I also like the idea of having the movie utilize found-footage in a way that is important to the story, while not having it as the main gimmick for the entire runtime. I will also say that the acting from the cast is pretty good and I was shocked that Chris got Keith David and Derek Mears to be apart of this movie. There is a good bit of tension built throughout the movie that is pretty effective when it needs to be. I also like how the story plays out and how things come together by the end of the experience that felt earned for the most part. And finally, This movie gives me hope that it could open the door for other YouTubers who have ideas for good movies that Hollywood could make and lead to original ideas for the future.

Negatives for Shelby Oaks (2025): The movie does fall into some of the cliches that I've seen in other movies with a premise similar to this one. The movie is also heavily effected by the low budget where there are some things that feel like they were cut out. And finally, I wasn't a big fan of ending as it felt so random and jarring that I struggled to figure out what the point of that ending was.

Overall, Shelby Oaks (2025) is an impressive mystery horror movie and directorial debut for YouTuber Chris Stuckmann that despite its shortcomings I want to see succeed and open the door for more opportunities for other filmmakers, who want to make movies.",literal
"Why is it filmed so darkly? This is one of my favorite shows, EXCEPT that nearly every scene is filmed so darkly it's almost impossible to watch anymore. I was watching season 17 episodes 4 and 5 this afternoon. The scene in the jail, the scenes in the BAU offices, are all extremely dark. Here they are in the BAU office but there are no overhead lights on. Penelope is working at her computer in a dark room. It's gotten to where it's just ridiculous how dark all the scenes are. Nobody works in any kind of business where everything is constantly unlit. I understand if you're outside at night it's dark out, but not in an office building. Buildings have lights turn them on and film things so that we can actually see who the damn people are. If the cost to turn lights on is so prohibitive then maybe you shouldn't be making this show.",literal
"Stylish but hollow, didn't live up to the hype I watched both seasons of Severance after seeing all the rave reviews, but I can't say I came away impressed. Yes, the concept is original and the production is sleek, it's well shot, well acted, and clearly aiming for something ambitious. But ultimately, I found it more pretentious than profound.

The tone is relentlessly bleak, which might work if the payoff justified the mood. But instead, it feels like it's trying too hard to be deep, without actually offering much insight. I kept waiting for that moment where it would all click, where the metaphors would land or the emotional core would emerge, but it never really did. The pacing is slow, the characters are hard to connect with, and the world-building, while intriguing at first, leans into weird-for-weird's-sake territory.

Maybe I missed some deeper meaning, but to me it came off as a hyper-stylized, overthought show that doesn't quite deliver on its premise. Not terrible by any means - but not as profound or gripping as it thinks it is.",literal

I kind of enjoyed musicals as a kid due to Disney's movies, but I've enjoyed Hazbin's musicals a lot. Alastor & Adam also became my favorite characters! The main thing I love about this show is that usually people sees Heaven as lovely and innocent while they see Hell as torture and evil, until they realize Heaven is behind illegal exterminations towards Hell which shows they are the true evil realm. After watching season 1, and after meeting Vivzie, and the voice actors at SacAnime Summer 2024, I am most definitely ready for Season 2!",literal
"What an expierience.. First off, this is the BEST Fantastic 4 movie made so far.

This is exactly how the family should have been!! And I'm so glad to see it finally be done here! It was more of a heartthrobing movie than I expected it to be. I loved the small humor here and there, with a more broad focus on the actual conflict itself-- and the emotional TURMOIL that came along with this too!

For example, that scene when Johnny reminds The Silver Surfer of the constant lives and deaths she's responsible for was one of the peaks of the movie.

I genuinley think this is one of the best Marvel movies created within the past few years.

Some cons:

As much as I loved the role the silver surfer played in the movie, I do wish she had a bigger role in the final battle... she just kinda kicked johnny away and took herself out along with galactus... a good sendoff-- but i do wish there was some scene about her that came before that.

Otherwise! Amazing job Marvel! One of the better cinemas produced by them in a while. It's good to see even after all this time, they can do something amazing like this.",literal
"Should have been better! Relying on location, nudity, sex (16+, really?), and veurerism of the rich and vengeful. No substance, plot twists, or creativity. The cast could have been great, but fails to get past the sloppy sophomoric writing. Don't waste your time, the cast is just a list of familiar names, not an indication of talent. Kept waiting for it to get better, but it is just too predictable. The animal cruelty is overdone. We all know that's where many killers start, then graduate to people. Sex and nudity belie the 16+ rating, parents beware!",literal
"Tremendous acting. Fun storyline. Absolutely top tier production and acting throughout. The screenplay is clever and interesting, engaging and well-paced. Character development is pretty robust, and the players aren't simple caricatures. Again and again a character at first appears to be one-dimensional, but then the story develops and they actually are much more complex than the first blush.

My only complaint is that some of the injected ""romance"" storylines are so ham-fisted and out of place they are disjointed and jarring. Professional situations that suddenly devolve into ""I'm just a girl, standing in front of a boy"" seemingly out of nowhere. Someone decided to soap opera the show up a bit and it does not improve the result.",literal
"Totally misunderstood masterpiece Reading the reviews here I can't help but notice how reviewers expect the US Rambo Wins nerrative or at least clear answers.

This movie does not aim to provide answers but rather provoke thought. It's not a thriller but rather a semi-documentary drama - so reviewer expectations of twists in the plot or clear black vs white are unjustified and thus most reviews are wrongfully biased.

This is a chilling movie, depicting a real life scenario that can happen any minute albeit being a bit melodramatic, and is worth watching just to understand how the world is at the brink of destruction each and every day - with most people not being aware of that.

Great acting, great screenplay, great plot, great angles and feels immersive.

"Love this series Western series - beautiful Navajo scenery. Great actors ! You really connect and bond w them I really love the main actor - he's an excellent actor, brilliant and very likable. He has such a deep love for this region and the Dine ppl. I love any story about Native Americans. I like the time period in the 70's. The supporting actors are great too - the cute FBI agent who ends up staying on the ranch as deputy and the beautiful servant lady I hope they end up together he's so sweet to her. I wish they had more stories about the navajo people on the reservation that would be really nice to get to know some of their lives and what it's like living there and even elders talking about the past and how it affected them.

The producer is Robert Redford he doesn't seem to know what he's doing the editing is bad (like for example once there's a close up of a guy and then the camera switches back to scene it's awkward)",literal
"A stand out series that works. I have never liked Billy Bob.. until I watched this... I don't know why, he just never seemed like my cup of tea... but wow, that man can act. This whole package works, the casting, the writing, the cinematography (top-notch) and especially the acting all hit the proverbial high notes. The gritty reality of the subject lends to story being faced from all sides, from the greenest worm to the elite execs, and all are credible. Billy Bob Thornton, Ali Larter and Michelle Randolph really shine, and amongst some real stellar performances from a solid and capable cast, this is impressive. Finally a series that keeps on giving and makes you want more!",figurative
"Needed some refinements but still effective! The first half of 'Eddington' evokes memories of the tumultuous period marked by medicinal masks, social distancing, the enforcement of COVID protocols, and challenges in peaceful cooperation occasionally faced by the authorities.

The storytelling serves as a poignant reminder of the tragedy that has left a significant portion of the population not just in a small town in America but all over the world scarred and furious with their governing administrations.

In addition to this stark recollection of tragic events, I appreciated how the narrative develops and nurtures the underlying animosity brewing between the Sheriff and the Mayor of the town, played competently by Joaquin and Pedro respectively and subsequently the escalation of their conflict to a higher level of intensity, which caught me off guard in all honesty.

The execution may not be as refined as Aster's previous works, the movie still presents the familiar blend of humor, horror, and societal critique that Ari Aster is known for.

However, I found myself wishing for a more impactful conclusion. Given the trajectory of the story, I anticipated a a resolution that would be more chaotic and emotionally driven, regrettably, it did not materialize!",literal

I want to stop binging after Hotch. But I want to give Prentiss a chance to lead and I she's lovely. I love her. Besides my fave character Penelope and Spencer still here on this season.

I am giving another chance to watch the new actors, I might like them and continue binging this series

"Stallone at his best. This series is so well written and directed, I don't know why more people aren't recommending it. It's funny heart warming and addictive. I was hoping for something good and Mr Stallone didn't let me down. My only concern is that I don't know if there's another series after this one . This series is so well written that it can go anywhere. I don't want to spoil the story but I'm sure you know that Sylvester Stallone plays Dwight Manfredi a New York Mafia capo, and he's been in prison for some years, now he wants his payback. Without wishing to be horrible, Stallone's language and speech has no connection to his previous roles so please give the programme a view, you won't regret it. Thank you Mr Stallone, it's very very entertaining.",literal
"Excellent sequel for nostalgic fans As a huge Freaky Friday fan I was thrilled to see this sequel. I absolutely loved that the main roles were played by the same actors as 22 years ago which is just wholesome and heartwarming. Freakier Friday is the definition of a feel good movie. Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan were impeccable, the script and the lines were hilarious in general. Probably Freakier Friday was a bit more on the emotional side than Freaky Friday, but still hilarious. I am beyond happy for this sequel and I can only recommend it.",literal
A great show on overall But personally I think the show needs a huge twist. After otis died it lacked big twist other than severide almost dying and casey leaving. What i think the show needs is to completely kill off casey while hes in a fire in Oregon and they bring his body to chicago where all of 51 including dawson and mills to have a large funeral and memorial for casey and that would bring the show a big twist.,literal
"Unsurprisingly Poor Predictably, this was worse than the previous two, which were pretentious, boring, bordering on annoying and an enormous waste of time. This one however, seemingly let an AI write a mash of the first two with the addition of sequel tropes including the trio of new gen z (ish) characters to spice things up, the reunification of the old characters, the death of the old mentor and the cartoony villain.

The names of all the characters are drawn from poor fantasy novels (Bosco, Thadeus being among a few) and the only redeeming feature of this movie is probably the impeccable Rosamund Pike who nails the accent and whose versatility really shines, as you absolutely hate her character.

The tricks are boring and predictable as is the story. Everything works out in ways that make absolutely no sense, and they explain it is by panning the camera away or using plot armor for all the characters that for some reason are also now highly skilled at martial arts.

Again, I was not disappointed as I did not expect anything at all, it was simply terrible in all the most predictable ways.

Also, did they just reuse the set from inception? Fun but stupid.",figurative
Amazing show Jason Bateman again knocked it out of the park. What a great show keeps you on your edge of your toes. You're always wondering what's gonna happen next. I caught myself going to bed late because I wanted to watch one more episode. I sure hope they do a season two. That's if all the characters make it. I'm only on episode six right now. The acting is superb. Character development does not take very long at all. They jump right into it. You get comfortable with the characters immediately.,literal
"Last season HORRIBLE I am in shock as to the degree they have ruined this show. Literally EVERY scene in the last season is some absurd liberal talking point. Every scene.

I would be surprised if anyone can actually sit through the last season, because I had to turn it off it was so ridiculous.",literal
"A Man on the Inside This is very much a one joke idea stretched out to being a series. It coasts very much on the name and credentials of Ted Danson, who to be honest, looks like he's sleep-walking through this and could probably actually do all that's required of him here in his sleep.

Perhaps it would work better if he was.

This isn't good, it's not overly funny, but then again it doesn't need to be. This is just content for the sake of content, with big names attached to get you to make that all important click when it pops up. Whether you stick with it is really neither here nor there.

"Quintessential Sirk As is usually the case, the book, a novel of personal reform and spiritual power , is better than movie. A little soap-opera-like but with the mystic or magical-seeming part. The film was glossy, predictable, and gave Mr Hudson plenty of excessive time to brood with that brooding face of his. Jane Wyman (Helen) was a little too old for him but it added validity to the relationship she had with Joyce (B. Rush) and her first husband. The original book was better in several ways. Joyce was much less of a wannabe movie star, Tom existed for much more than legalities, and Nancy's devotion (A. Moorehead) to the family made more sense. But Helen ! I never could quite believe she loved her first husband and that is crucial to the whole story.",literal
"A Stunning Nothingness ""Black Phone 2"" (without the article) is set four years after the events of the first film, with Finney and Gwen still dealing with the trauma of both the Grabber and their abusive father. When Gwen starts to have new, terrifying visions, her and Finney discover that the Grabber may be dead, but he's not gone.

The plot of this movie is honestly outstanding, building out the world created by Joe Hill and expanded by Scott Derrickson & C. Robert Cargill. Where the film fails though, is a complete lack of carnage, purpose, and failing to fully capitalize on the idea of a Dante's Inferno-accurate hellscape. The Grabber, still played to perfection by a terrifying Ethan Hawke, is nothing but a nuisance here. No one dies. Not a single person is killed by the now demonic(?) Grabber who is also suddenly connected to Gwen and Finney's late mother.

The movie is impeccably acted, the cinematography is incredible and the effects are gnarly, but the writing and direction is just a huge letdown because Derrickson and Cargill are absolutely capable of realizing a horrifying hell where the Grabber relentlessly eviscerated kids and adults on his revenge quest from the afterlife. Seriously, how awesome would it have been to see hell from Dante's Inferno realized in this sequel!",figurative
"Vince Gilligan Vince Gilligan goes back to his sci-fi roots with this one. He Brings with him Rhea Seehorn (from better call saul) to be the lead in this sci-fi/comedy/horror/drama series.

"Beauty & the Beast: a howlingly successful blend of monsters and martial arts in a Louis XV setting! 'Le Pacte des Loups' takes the Beast of the Gévaudan (to which over 100 deaths were attributed 1764-67) as the starting-point for a thrilling action-adventure fantasy. 'The Hound of the Baskervilles' meets a 'Crouching Tiger' for a 'Dangerous Liaison' with 'The Last of the Mohicans' in 'Sleepy Hollow'. Result: an exciting, beautifully photographed and well-acted film.

The film opens during the French Revolution: a middle-aged gentleman writes his memoirs, while a hostile mob, singing ""Ça ira"", gathers outside his home. Only towards the end will we know for certain which of our protagonists he is.

25 years previously, a mysterious Beast terrorises the Gévaudan. Strangers avoid the region - except for the Chevalier Grégoire de Fronsac and his Iroquois friend Mani. After rescuing peasant animal-healer Jean Chastel and his beautiful, mute daughter (ironically nicknamed 'The Gossip') from some men in drag, Grégoire and Mani stay with the Marquis d'Apcher and his grandson Thomas.

Grégoire, a naturalist from the King's Gardens, has been sent to return the Beast (preferably stuffed) to the royal collection. He is a religious sceptic and libertine, representing rationality and Enlightenment values. Mani, a medicine-man and warrior who became his blood-brother during the Seven Years' War, is attuned to the natural world: his totem animal is the wolf. Together, these embodiments of Reason and Rousseauesque proto-Romanticism make a formidable team.

Grégoire's Parisian scepticism ruffles the reactionary local clergy and nobles, including Father Henri Sardis, and the pious Geneviève, Comtesse de Morangias. Her husband the Comte warns that a Papal spy is also investigating the case. Their son, Jean-François, seems at first a potential ally. An ex-naval officer, maimed by a lion in Africa, he is courageous and witty - but has secret torments.... Why does he resent the developing attraction between his sister Marianne and Grégoire? Who is the Italian courtesan, Sylvia, who ensnares Grégoire at the brothel in Mende? Whom can Grégoire and Mani trust? While a book by the mysterious 'The Wolves of God' attacks the King and calls the Beast's predations a divine judgement on the nation, the killings continue.

Cue thrilling hunts, battles with Gypsies, treachery, murder, poisoning, madness, incest, clerical conspiracies, heresy, and trick-weaponry any 18C James Bond would covet. There is a spectacularly acrobatic climactic sword-fight in a ruined church, a happy ending for two characters, while our narrator, at last identified, 25 years later goes bravely to his doom.

The film is lavishly produced and filmed, and splendidly acted. Some have thought Samuel Le Bihan insufficiently glamorous as Grégoire: but glamour is not a trait I expect in an 18C natural historian, and I found him likable and credible. The problem is, the other two leading men are so striking and charismatic that he is overshadowed. This is no criticism of him as an actor: simply that his character is inherently less showy.

Mark Dacascos' wolf-shaman warrior Mani is engaging: serenely beautiful, thoughtful, yet dynamic in action. He is a man of few, but telling words, and powerful presence: he expresses so much with his eyes that one believes his ability to communicate with trees, birds and wolves. Emilie Dequenne (Marianne) grows in courage and maturity as the film progresses. Jérémie Renier (Thomas) is an appealing ingénu.

But real-life couple Vincent Cassel (Jean-François) and Monica Bellucci (Sylvia) steal the show. Both their characters rely, literally and metaphorically, on masks to conceal loyalties, emotions, and - in Jean-François' case - insanity: both actors convey these complexities with panache. Cassel combines extraordinary emotional range with terrific swashbuckling, and ultimately attains 'tragic villain' stature. (Having been a lion's chew-toy would, I suspect, be enough to derange most people.) He also looks strikingly handsome in 18C costume. Bellucci is superb as Sylvia the courtesan/spy - like a beautiful but deadly snake. She's glamorous, intelligent, powerful, dangerous; sexy, but no mere sex-object: one of the best heroines of any film I saw in 2001.

The most familiar face in the supporting cast is Edith Scob ('Eyes Without a Face') as Comtesse Geneviève: a mother you would *not* want making your cocoa. Jean Yanne plays her long-suffering, amiable husband. Virginie Darmon, as Chastel's mute, epileptic daughter, is a haunting, feral presence. Possibly more could have been made of her implied attraction to Mani, a fellow outsider.

The mystery of the Beast's identity is preserved by its disguise - more effective than revealing it to be ""only a wolf/lion/hyena/white rabbit"", & c. The Jim Henson Workshop brings it to life as a tormented creature for which, at the end, we have some pity. The live animal cast must also be mentioned with some credit: Mani's spirit-wolf is beautiful!

As with 'Sleepy Hollow', 'Pacte's genre-bending, fantastic approach immunises it against those criticisms regarding accuracy and anachronism which 'realistic' historical dramas court. But it was good to hear Occitan spoken by a child survivor in hospital, and I enjoyed the scene in the ruined church which placed the story in a longer continuum of heresy and religious violence. As Mani senses, and Marianne explains, the church had been the site of a massacre of Cathars in 13C by the Knights Templar (in turn judicially murdered on heresy charges a century later). The ruin then becomes the site of the meetings of the 'Wolves of God' and of the dramatic climax. Some viewer criticisms of Grégoire's visits to Sylvia while he is courting Marianne show ignorance of 18C social mores: since unmarried girls of good family were meant to be chaste before marriage, their lovers would turn to professionals for sex.

My main quibble is one of the final twists, when the script backs away from a romantic tragedy which would have strengthened the already poignant ending. I wonder whether a preview audience is to blame? Even so, 'Pacte' should have garnered the international plaudits and awards heaped instead on 'Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain' - who surely would have been Beast-food in the 1760s Gévaudan!",figurative
"Grotesque In the hands of director Ron Howard and star Jim Carrey, ""Dr. Seuss' How The Grinch Stole Christmas"", is a loud, obnoxious, excessive, CHARMLESS bore. This very short story is expanded to 1 hour and 45 minutes of grotesque imagery that focuses on repugnant characters, who wear out their welcome within 30 seconds.  Carrey's schtick is beyond unbearable.  Easily one of the worst films I have ever seen.  NOT recommended!",literal
"Tarantino meets Rambo meets Nazis in Lapland - Sisu This was a pleasant surprise! We have Tarantino-inspired bloody action, silent and very charismatic protagonist, beautiful imaginery from actual locations in Lapland, really good soundtrack and some innovative fighting and survival scenes, and of course Finnish Sisu.

Jorma Tommila as the leading man does a phenomenal job. He has only one line in the whole movie (an instant classic), but he is acting very well just by using his face and body.

""He is not immortal, he just refuses to die.""

Congratulations for the writer/director Jalmari Helander, the movie looks really good, flows forward easily and is overall very cool and original, despite the overused tropes of evil nazis and action. With just 6 million budget this looks much bigger.

Some nitpicks: the nazis speak English, even when talking with each other, which is kind of weird. But it makes sense for scenes with some Finns.

I really hope this gets much views all over the world.

"Was great and now mediocre I'm rating this a 7 because this show was once great and it's now simply mediocre so 7 is the average. Jerry Orbach, Sam Waterston, and others from the ""old"" cast are wonderful. The stories were interesting.

The current iteration of the show is lacking. I think Anthony Anderson does a great job and my attention perks up when Waterston appears on screen. I find the other characters not compelling at all, often awkward, and, really, kind of annoying. The storylines seem to be a second thought, with the show resting on the excitement that Law & Order is back. Nearly all the episodes thus far seem ""ripped from the headlines"" or very obviously inspired by real-life people and events.

I hope that future episodes will be closer to the quality of previous seasons.",literal

One thing I admire though is the acting performance with the Mexican thug antagonist, was really impressive and convincing and made me love his acting a lot than anyone else in the movie. I wouldn't strongly recommend this movie but if you are a fan of Neeson and sniper lover, then I guess you should watch this in your spare time.",literal
"Such a good and underrated show! I have to say, this show is really underrated and deserves way more attention. It's honestly great, characters are interesting, acting is good, and the humor hits just right.

"Copy and paste. This show is a copy and paste of the French version. It does indicate on the show is based on the French show yet one thing is based another is to be a copy and paste.

I just can't avoid remembering and anticipating the other show was very entertaining and sucked me to my screen to binge watch. I wanted this show to explore the feelings that the main characters will have in a better way as this can make the show very competitive. And even when I know what is coming I still will time in every time it to enjoy this show.",literal
"Very 📖 accurate I loved it and I don't care if some people say it's a popcorn movie.

It so very book accurate adaption, except some tiny details but I don't want to spoil it.

I feared that it will become a comedy action from what I seen in the trailer, but when it has to be deep, it can be deep. And I need to mention one more thing as a huge Stephen King fan.

King is the King! This man in 82' said that people will manipulate photos and videos and look at that, we are living in it right now. The story has a huge social criticism and it is very current. In my opinion the movie did a good job of reproducing the book, I recommend it to any fellow King fan, I think you won't be disappointed.",literal
"Disappointing Book Adaptation I had high hopes for this movie and it left me feeling like.... that's it?? One of the biggest storylines was left out with Miller, but then mentioned once during the movie. Certain parts/character development was rushed. There was no spark and the movie felt flat. If you read the book you will be disappointed. If you didn't read it, you will most likely enjoy it.",literal
"Excellent until season 5 This series was fantastic up until season 5. I'm not sure what went wrong-maybe they ran out of creative ideas or lost direction with the storyline. I've noticed many reviews criticize the flashbacks, but for me, they're the only thing keeping my interest alive at this point. I just wish there wasn't so much back-and-forth. A whole season dedicated to Smurf's backstory would have been amazing.

Another aspect I find off-putting is the excessive emphasis on Deran's romantic encounters. I have no issue with him being gay, but it feels overly focused at times. I get the message, but some scenes, like when he has a threesome, seem unnecessary and waste valuable screen time without contributing to the plot. It has reached a point where Deran has become less engaging as a character.

On the other hand, Shawn Hatosy shines as Andrew, delivering an outstanding performance that adds significant depth to his character. Ellen Barkin also excels in her role as Smurf. Overall, if you can overlook the excessive and often pointless scenes, this series remains a strong watch.",figurative
"One to watch! It's a mini horror movie every week. Supernatural brings American urban legends into your home each episode. All those stories you told around the campfire as a child come to life in this explosive TV show. From the exceptional writing to the awesome soundtrack, this TV show is a step above the rest. I love seeing the dynamic between the brothers, Sam and Dean. It seems that no matter what has happened in the past, family is family. I imagine this show is a production nightmare. There are so many great special effects, it's like being at your local cinema. And you can't forget that car. A '67 Impala that the brothers travel the country in. With the classic rock tunes blaring on the cassette player and the roar of the engine, this car is hot! Overall, I think Supernatural is one of the best shows on TV. My only concern is them running out of good material. I mean there are only so many urban legends. However, I've heard they've got the first 3 seasons pretty much mapped out, so at least we can have a few good years, right.",literal
"Finally! Great Show. Firstly, the great things. No politics, no race baiting. Just a very intriguing story of a loser that can't help spread it to everyone he touches. Come near him and you might get caught up in his tornado. That Jason Bateman would play such a loser unlikable character, is another of the best parts of this show. He really sells it with every piece of dialogue and body. Jude Law is fantastic. The two together are just brilliant TV. Hated finishing it because there are no shows like this. Raw, unlikable characters that propel the story along, that's what we are here for a great story. Very entertaining to watch.

"True detective with Native Americans An exciting, interesting series in a familiar setting. Little action but lots of dialogue. Unfortunately, the full potential is not exhausted and fails due to the banal story structure, the constructed problems and the already seen and predictable twists. It can't be the actors alone. Especially since the setting with Navacho Indians and constant conflict definitely has potential. Sometimes the situation seems very constructed and cliche, and doesn't demand enough of the viewer. But it's still fun to watch the series, especially because it's relatively entertaining with six episodes and presents interesting characters. Nevertheless, the whole thing doesn't go beyond the normal average, but rather he presents individual and beautiful ideas that could have resulted in something exciting. Could have been a true detective with Native Americans.",literal
"A long-drawn-out film with a good-looking As a fan of the musical, this Part 1 spent 160 minutes to show how the director made a long-drawn-out film. I don't mind adding the characters from the original book, but it is not an excuse to add many details to the side plot and drag this movie to 160 munites.

When it comes to the climax, the most disappointing thing for me is also coming. The famous song Defying Gravity was interrupted in the movie (compared with the musical). When my tears came to my eyes, they were stopped by this interruption.

It is also a good marketing movie, there are a lot of peripheral products that can be purchased and a lot of online social media events. It made this movie come with a ""popular"" atmosphere, which I love to see.

All in all, this movie is a good-looking musical movie, literally.",literal

"Glass ceiling? Events conspired to keep me away from the cinema for a few weeks, so now I'm looking to try and catch up as best I can. This led to a relatively late evening showing of ""Roofman"" last night, a solid, if undemanding, comedy drama - based on a true story.

Jeffrey Manchester (Channing Tatum) is arrested for a series of armed robberies of fast-food restaurants, where he enters through the roof and awaits the arrival of the staff. Because of the mode of entry the media giving him the nickname 'Roofman'. Sentenced to 45 years, he escapes prison and, whilst awaiting assistance in fleeing the country, begins to hide in a Toys R Us, in a hollow space behind a bike display. To alleviate the boredom, he sets up cameras to track the actions of the staff and, as he learns more about the routines, he finds ways to leave the store, when it's not open for business.

It's obviously a lot easier to write a review of something if it inspires a passionate response in you, either negative or positive - but I'm afraid that ""Roofman"" for all it's qualities, doesn't really do that for me. Its performances are good - indeed Tatum's charisma alone is probably enough that it could have carried the film, without supporting roles from the always excellent LaKeith Stanfield and Peter Dinklage, and from Kirsten Dunst - let alone tiny turns from Jimmy O Yang, Tony Revolori, Juno Temple, Uzo Aduba and Ben Mendelsohn. The story is decent, even if perhaps some of it stretches the realms of plausibility, that comes with simplifying the story for the screen.

The trouble is, I can already acknowledge that I won't remember this film in a few months. It's lacking in surprise and, even though there are some sadder moments on introspection for Manchester to deal with, it's not that emotionally deep.

It's fine, if you are restricted on options for whatever reason, you won't come away regretting your time with it, but it's hard to actively recommend the film.",literal

"Not what I expected At first the only reason I watched the Sopranos was for my husband, but I did keep an open mind. Soon after renting the first season both he and I were hooked. The characters were so real. You liked to love them and you liked to hate them. It was also very convenient that they killed all the characters that I thought should have been killed. ;) The irony of the show is that most of the time we get this mob picture of a character like Pauly just having fun and acting tough. This shows you the fears and weaknesses of toughest wise guys. 

You see Tony's inner conflict (James Gandolfini is a great actor) between being a good husband and father and his reputation and duties to the mob. You also see Carmela's side with Tony always gone, but she still tries to make it work and she still loves him. I love the different characters, they really picked a great cast. 

The show just keeps your attention because you never know what will happen or how characters will react. I highly recommend it for people who don't have weak stomachs. 

P.S. For the people who don't like it, It is called ENTERTAINMENT.",literal
"Derivative, predictable and formulaic mediocrity I SO much wanted to like this series. I really did. But the pilot was just borderline, so I optimistically waited for S1E2. Unfortunately, it further confirmed my initial reaction: this is Déjà vu TV and not in a good way. So far everything has been done before--and better.

Older viewers can probably remember shows that have used this same formula: protagonist with baggage in his past works with a somewhat nerdy guy/gal who does the tech behind the scenes, and is supported by handlers that behave like office managers. The story lines have been superficial, the action sequences forced and illogical.

There's also some very amateurish editing. For example, in S1E2 at approximately 11 minutes, it's raining and his truck is wet, windows dotted with drops. The very next scene right afterwards the truck is not only dry and detailed spotless, but the passenger window is rolled down. Seconds ago it was a downpour. Really? Most scenes are not filmed contiguously, but since these shots occur sequentially, it was quite an obvious gaffe.

I know we live in a world of remakes, re-issues, re-mixes and sequels to the max. It's a sign of no originality and lack of writing talent. Yes, this show *might* survive past S1 as we've seen that quality does not correlate with success (and the opposite is also true). Intelligent shows have suffered premature deaths while drivel like could potentially live on. Perhaps Paramount will put it out of its misery sooner than later.

No, it's not the worst show on TV, but I'm going to pass on the remaining episodes.",literal
"Please don't do a Predator/Independence Day crossover..... ..... We had that Alien Easter Egg in Predator 2, and they do it here with the aliens from Independence Day. It's head slappingly awful, and then you have to contend with the rest of the film.

If you're into 3D, there is one stand out scene that is brilliant in the format, but this isn't your Mommas Predator film.

I wasn't bothered by the rating, it's a 12A here in the UK, but there is not one human character in the film, so we have white fluid, and green fluid, which constitutes for blood.

Elle Fanning is playing a game of two halves, one a very immature Synth who would look better in a Barbie sequel, and another character who would make Ian Holm proud.

My main problem with the film is that I just didn't care about a single character, not even the gleep glop that looks like the creature from Lost In Space, so I became very bored, very quickly, which shouldn't happen in a Predator film.

I never thought I'd say this, but there is a Predator film that I actually hate, and it's this.

IMs Ute I'm in the minority though, and I truly hope you enjoy it.....",figurative
"Why is the predator not big? Oh because they're doing this other thing...

Ugh... Okay, what's this other thing they're doing instead, while keeping the Predator name attached?

Okay so, from the trailers, Weyland-Yutani is here. This is immediately problematic to me. I am of the opinion that the Alien franchise already went off the rails with Aliens, before the original Predator movie had even come out. But accepting Aliens, I don't think you can plausibly do much more with the concept of Weyland-Yutani vs low tech aliens because... why? Because Weyland-Yutani has synth technology and AI in general, so if they are prepared for a fight, alien creatures aren't going to pose a real threat, whether they're xenomorphs or the beast in this movie.

So here, why the heck is Weyland-Yutani sending a bunch of human-shaped synths to hunt some huge monster? Oh and look, it's a power loader! James Cameron hydraulics, but with CGI! How nostalgic! But... why isn't that thing loaded out with all the weapons and AI?

The writers were supposed to ask these questions and fix things so that they make sense. From the trailers, from the synopsis, from the names involved, I know they didn't do that.

Dear reader, I stopped watching movies with these warning signs and I suggest others do the same.

Dear studios, hire sci-fi writers for your next sci-fi movie project. I promise it will help.",literal
"Fantastic duality The premise of a kidnapping sets the stage for relentless tension, with power dynamics bubbling up and exploding like a pressure cooker throughout the film.

What struck me most was the brilliant duality between Michelle: the wealthy, hyper-educated liberal vs Teddy: the poor, conspiracy-driven incel (along with his cousin). Their exchanges mirror the polarized conversations we so often hear today between the progressive left and the reactionary right, where both sides speak but no one truly listens.

It's an incredibly fertile setup. A sharp reflection of our times, where extreme views dominate the airwaves and common ground seems impossible, even as we all share the same fragile planet, one whose survival depends on our ability to rethink how we consume its resources.

The three lead actors deliver outstanding performances, capturing every flicker of discomfort, fear, and rage so vividly that the audience can't help but squirm in their seats.

Without spoiling the ending, I'll just say it's undeniably original, though for me, it strays from the rich ideological duel that powers the story up to that point.

Still, Bugonia is an absolute must-see. A gripping, provocative, and brilliantly acted film with Oscar-worthy performances.",literal
"Why would you even try without Henry Cavill? I really enjoyed Seasons 1 and 2. 80% of why I watched was Henry.

He is a brilliant actor that completely embodied the Witcher. The fight scenes and set design were spot on. I admit to a bit of skipping when Henry was not on screen.

By season three the writing was sloppy, the storyline was a snore fest with a constant barrage of people and place names.

Henry became 100% of why I was watching. I don't think I will bother with the last two seasons.

I do not understand why they would not give him the world to stay. Also why they would fight him on his opinoins on how the character should be potrayed. He obviously knew more about the character then the show runners. I hope he gets cast in a movie version.",literal
"Fantastic comedy cop drama I have to give this show a solid 10 because if I sit and think what could possibly be done to make this show any better than what it is, the answer is nothing. It is the perfect blend of mystery, drama, suspense, comedy and crime, with endless whodunnits. It is fast paced, even the intro is perfect! After a mere five seconds it goes straight into the show, and will have you sitting impatiently on the edge of your seat, waiting for the next segment. There is always something going on, no lapse or waste of time at all! I love the retro clothing of the lead female, love her character too. The acting is top notch, actually everything about this show is top notch. This show is perfection to me and i hope it never ends!!!",literal
"Sick of Sheridan's Porn Was looking forward to this show, but as usual, not bothering to keep watching it, just as the final Yellowstone was a porn disaster.

No idea why Sheridan would have a horrible actress as Billy Bob Thornton's daughter, anddddd as expected....porn.

Can't Sheridan do decent classy shows without women doing nudity. No probably not.

After episode 2.... I have better things to watch than his disgusting porn.

Notice he never wants to show naked porn men, but hey, he makes sure he does women porn.

How disappointing that again, and again and again, he has to have porn in his shows.

He needs to learn how to do decent films. UGH.",literal
"Seriously? I wanted to love it. I've only watched the first episode and I can't believe how bad it was. Really stupid characters and situations.

I do hope it gets much better. They've got a long way to go. (Sad face)

"Gold does NOT rust! Strangely enough, this goof describes the downfall of the series perfectly.

Season 1: 10 Stars, simply amazing, beyond expectations.

Season 2: 8 Stars. Very good with many lovely story telling.

Season 3: ... What the hell was that?

In one of the latest episodes of season 3, Yennefer says ""Look at all these Gold, left here to rust"".

Yennefer is a powerful sorcerer, that has lived for centuries and has extensive knowledge in alchemy. She would most definitely know that Gold does not rust. That's what makes it so special.

And that summarize the quality of the 3rd season and how once an amazing show with beautiful story, wide characters and extended knowledge has now become a total waste of time.",literal
"Would love to give a better rating, but just couldn't.... I was super hyped for this film. There are some positive aspects like the old lighthearted justice loving superman is back!! He is just a straight up a good guy who wants to save each and every person and loves everyone. It's nice to get away from the dark tone of the modern day superhero films!

David Corenswet is not bad. Christopher Reeves was great as both, Brandon Routh was a great Clarke Kent but not a good superman, Henry Cavill a great superman but not a good Clarke Kent, and now Corenswet is good in both roles butnot great in either. Loved Lois Lane, very similar to the original film.

Now coming to the film itself, it's not well paced, with inconsistencies all over the place. The first half was actually pretty bad. Starting the film right away from the fight with Ultraman seemed too fast. There were no character introductions, the justice gang just came and every characters were introduced straight into the battlefield. I'd have loved if the initial scenes involved Superman saving Jarhanpur from Boravia. It would've given the film a better start, maybe making the film 2.5 hrs long by adding 20 more minutes wouldn't have been too bad.

Loved Mr. Terrific. He was the best part of the whole film, and his fight scene in the beach was the best!! The rest of the Justice gang were meh.

Lex Luthor was kinda similar to the first Superman film where he wanted to bomb the cities and rename them to his name. I'd have been okay with that, but at the end when it's revealed he jist envies Superman and cries like a baby destroys Luther's character as a whole. And how the hell does he get mutants like metamorpho imprisoned in the pocket universe! So many stuff he has done, created Superman's clone, made the Engineer, created mini universes, made a war, only because he is jealous of superman! That doesn't sound right.

So, so many plot holes. Where the hell does Luthor get a freaking kaiju, pretty convenient how he went to Superman's den to find out some leverage against him and immediately finds that he was sent to kill everyone (Goku reference), how and when hawkgirl, green lantern and metamorpho team up and save Jarhanpur, how blowing INTO a black hole pushes you away from the hole, and the second black hole doesn't even pull superman at all!! And lots more.

I loved the interactions with Jonathan and Martha Kent, the emotions felt great, the story of Jarhanpur and Boravia symbolizes the present Israel Palestine war and very positive and good messages were given, I loved it, but judging the film only, the making could've been a lot better. This Superman is just good and kinda stupid sometimes. Superman should be intelligent to some extent too apart from being good.

Anyways hopefully the next films will be better!",literal
"Thank God for Cartoons I'm overjoyed that the culmination of tumblr, electroswing, post-Cartoon Network, Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends aesthetics resulted in something this loving, musical, and expressive.

Helluva Boss has some great moments but has large swaths that don't resonate much with me, but here everything miraculously clicks. The web of backstories and plotlines are all juggled surprisingly deftly with a great balance between intimate character moments and larger scale worldbuilding (something I've always struggled with in these sorta fantasy shows but I think flows in a very engaging way here), the characterizations are all handled with real sensitivity (and with fitting nuance given the central conceit of the show), and ill go out on a limb and say all the musical segments do wonders for me (the recasting of the voice cast with seasoned musical theater veterans was an essential choice in this regard).

Ive been thinking lately about how i used to lay in the back of my parents car during road trips and close my eyes and imagine these rly vivid music videos in my head while shuffling Beatles songs on my MP3 player, usually focused on characters from MLP or Ruby Gloom, and have lamented that I haven't been able to do that in years. The other day I was chillin listening to Tricky's ""Suffocated Love"" and I saw this whole Hazbin Hotel lookin music video in my head so vividly jus like when I was a kid, and for that alone I'm deeply grateful for this show.

Sure it's a very easy thing to dunk on, but as a cultural object for someone who grew up watching ridiculous amounts of cartoons, this has been exactly the shot of inspiration I've needed at the start of the year.",literal
"Spend your two hours doing something else Let me start by saying that the acting is excellent all round. Meets and exceeds all expectations. But this film is the last thing we need right now. To me, it does not tell a truth about mothers, women or anybody. It's actually an insult. It's clear the goal is for it to be uncomfortable to view/experience, so that you feel the genuine discomfort in the situations that are portrayed. But it is insurmountably unpleasant as an experience. Example, I can't stand to see a baby cry. I want to comfort immediately. In this film you have to sit helplessly while a baby cries for what feels like twenty minutes. There's animal abuse & stories of same. It's just an awful and useless experience. Horrible film, in our opinion.",literal
"In spite of strong setup, ends up being a dud A show that starts out strong and interesting, and then by the end of season 1, caves in on itself with cliches and poor writing. Even the acting kind of rolls into boring territory by the time this wraps up. Thats too bad, considering the potential. A missed opportunity.",literal
"Not Good Superman is moody, angry, insecure, and immature in this. Nothing like the stoic ideal we all know him as. They made Jimmy Olsen an unexplainable ladie's man, Hawk Girl was way young and had comical closeups of her screeching like a hawk (which she doesn't do), Nathan Fillion would've made a better Hal Jordan than Guy Gardner, Ultra Man was reimagined as a clone who dresses like Black Noir from ""The Boys,"" and the plot was a convoluted mess. I will give kudos to Mr. Terrific and ... That's it. One thing for sure is James Gunn cannot portray Superman for the big screen. I give it a ""D"" at best.",literal
"""FBI""...Are you kidding.!!! I love to read the reviews of a new series before I take the time-out to watch it and, having read quite a few negative feedbacks, I wasn't going to bother. However, I did decide to watch the first two opening episodes due to the prologue ( as I think 'Missy Peregwyn' is a really Great & Convincing actress ..as she is again on this series. Without her role as agent Bell & also her partner Zadin, this series could have hit a real blow.!!! Why does Jeremy Sistos character always have to scream and shout? Stella Ward..where is she convincing as FBI..are they really trying to tell us that ""FBI"" is going to be an ""Outstanding Series"" with overbearing actors like Stella Ward.? As well as over-acting the both of their roles, so-far, have been unconvincing and lethargic.! Ebonee Noels' character as an analyst was quite a turn-off. I don't know Ebonee Noel as an actress, but she was so awful so far in the opening two episodes...seriously.!!! Where was the passion? Why does she always seem to look up & roll her eyes when she's supposedly looking at the computer screen; her eyes are all over the place it's laughable😣. She was that annoying It kept distracting me from the scene. It continued in other scenes too, the scene where she was to disable a bomb (please) it was as though she was about to laugh; was this supposed to be tense? I had to rewind it repeatedly to be sure. An awful actress I must say 👎 The series may improve as the episodes evolve. If not for the pairing of ""Missy Peregrym and Zeeko Zaki"" (A Great Match by the way👌) I don't think I would have continued to watch it if I'm honest. I do not like to leave a bad review after so few an episode though unless I truly believe the series is that terrible, thst it's unwatchable.😉 It doesn't compare to the ""Law & Order"" franchises or ""Without A Trace"". I Shall give ""FBI"" a chance to get going, then, I shall revisit the review at the end of the last episode. Watch-out...😊",figurative
"Loving it I am a huge SK fan, the 1990s version had me terrified as a kid. The later versions were also pretty good, nobody beats Tim Curry as Pennywise, but felt a bit too commercial and dragged on, even tho the cinematography, setting, mood and everything was really good. I wasn't expecting much from this series but I have to say, this is scarrier then all the others. The story, the mood, the lighting, the scenery, the sound track, everything is awesome! Loved E4 and can't wait for this week to pass to watch E5.",literal
"Enjoyed it much...some spoiler An updated old school tv series that's really done well with all the cast especially the come back of Ted Danson.

Finished first season in one go and can't wait to start with the next chapter of this series.

It's fresh, witty, comic and well written. Somehow reminded me of old early 90's tv with a twist of modern vibes into it for the new generation.

I have to say that I enjoyed it for what it had to offer. I was a bit hesitant in the beginning not to watch anything to do with elderly homes and old people after my father passed away not too long ago, but I must say I wasn't in that depressing mood at all, on the contrary I enjoyed every single episode.",literal
"Landman or Landfill? Trashy Dallas 2.0? What's happening? I really want to like this show but both the plot and character development feels contrived and forced with over the top cliches. The slutty ex-wife and daughter characters are just annoying and becoming insufferable to watch.

The visual elements of the show are excellent and there's always a few scenes in each episode that are entertaining but they're few and far between.

The first episode started off strong but the second episode started to fall apart with plot and story direction.

I can't remember much of the third episode except a few small character developments but by the fourth episode so far watching I just feel nothing but disappointment. The only thing really holding my attention so far is watching Billy Bob Thornton's acting.",figurative
"Just awful I like the actors, but not in this movie. There isn't a single redeeming moment in this movie. The storyline is terrible. It's not a Christmas movie. It isn't a love story. It's a horrible woman treating people like trash and we are supposed to find her endearing. The support characters are OK. The hero's best friend and his family are sweet. I think that's the best I can say about this movie. Cheating. Lying. Cynicism. Another bride who doesn't appreciate anything. She isn't excited about planning her wedding. She's annoyed that her fiancé cares. She's just a brat. Don't bother with this one.",literal
"Awesome Action Film With Great One Liners From Arnie! This is an awesome action film with great one liners from Arnie!. It's stylishly made, with lots of tense action to keep one satisfied. The Characters were awesome, and Richard Dawson, is very menacing as the main villain. Yes it has tons of plot holes,however it's highly highly entertaining, with a great ending as well. It had a great story, too it, and Arnie and Maria Conchita Alonso had great chemistry together. The Character development was also pretty good, with, some superb performances. The Directing is great!. Paul Michael Glaser, does a very good job here, with awesome use of colors, keeping it stylish throughout, awesome camera angles, and overall keeping the film at a very fast pace! good job. There is a little bit of gore. We get a few bloody gunshot wounds, exploding head, slit throat, bloody chainsaw slices, skinless corpses, blood, and an impaling. The Acting is great!. Arnold Schwarzenegger is AMAZING as always, he is excellent in the acting department , has tons of hilarious one liners, kicks that ass, and as always is a big physical presence!, and was tons of fun to watch! (Arnie Rules!). Maria Conchita Alonso, does well here, she was really cute, and had good chemistry with Arnie!. Yaphet Kotto, is decent here, with what he has to do, which is not much. Marvin J. McIntyre, is good as the geeky type guy, he was cool!. Richard Dawson is awesome as the main villain, and was very very menacing, and he was fun to watch. Jesse Ventura,Jim Brown,Erland van Lidth,Gus Rethwisch,and Professor Toru Tanaka, all do what they have to do very well as the stalkers. Overall a MUST see! ****1/2 out of 5",literal
"Creepy sexualized minor Overall, I mostly enjoyed this show. There are a few unbelievable parts, but what TV doesn't have that these days. I liked the action- not too much, not too little. The characters are likable, except the mother and daughter. Ugh, those scenes are hard to get through.

However, the over sexualization of the daughter, and even the mother, was almost too much. It's ridiculous. I almost stopped watching and have some reservations about watching if there is a season 2. I'm encouraged that there are so many other reviews like this. Hopefully, the producers take note and tone it down a lot. They definitely are coming across as a bunch of pervy old men.",literal
"Worthwhile watching! This series tells us the story of Ross Poldark, a guy with very strong values: family, friends and social justice, are the most important things for him. But, a lot of times, he just screw things up because of his temper!

I liked the story, the acting, the natural scenery and the relations between the characters. The problem was on season five: to much time spent with ""one situation"" and the hurry to resolve the last one. It seems they thought there was going to be more episodes!",literal
"Terrible but somewhat interesting Movie based on Jacqueline Susann's best-selling novel. It's about Robin Stone (John Phillip Law) a ruthless TV anchorman who claws his way to the top. It details his love life concentrating on Amanda (Jodi Wexler) and Judith (Dyan Cannon). It also shows his total inability to commit to anyone and instead sleeps with any woman he can get.

The novel is no work of art (it's not even good literature) but it's a quick, silly, trashy read. However, compared to this movie, it seems like a masterpiece of fiction! This is a textbook example of how NOT to do a movie adaptation. First they condense the novel terribly. In the book Stone's inability to commit is dealt with and it's revealed why. Here it's brought up...and ignored. Characters from the book are either totally left out or changed completely. One of them (Maggie) pops up for two pointless scenes and then disappears completely! Also there's a truly revolting scene in which a woman is brutally beaten. It's in the book--but there IS a reason totally left out of the movie. And the book dealt with three women--not two. Don't even get me started on the homophobia. The movie is almost worth sitting through for a no holds barred fight at the end between Law, Cannon and David Hemmings.

Adaptation aside the acting is pretty terrible. Law is just horrendous as Stone--VERY wooden and boring--you seriously wonder why all these women are after him. To be fair to Law another actor was cast but had a very bad accident before shooting began and Law stepped in at the last minute. Wexler is terrible as Amanda; Maureen Arthur is truly astoundingly bad as Ethel Evans; Shecky Greene is unbearable as Christie Lane. Only three performances stand out: David Hemmings (having a GREAT time) camps it up as a gay photographer; Cannon is actually very good and Robert Ryan is just great. Also Dionne Warwick sings the catchy opening song (""He's Moving On""). Also Jacqueline Susann has a cameo as a newscaster.

It IS bad but I watched the whole thing and it is (in a silly sort of way) a lot of fun. I'm giving it a 3.",figurative
"Gripping Weapons is a gripping, twist-filled thriller that keeps you guessing from start to finish. The lead actress delivers a standout performance, anchoring the film with emotional depth. While some scenes are gruesome and intense, they serve the story's darker themes. A bold, unsettling watch worth your time.",literal
"Threat level midnight Michael Scott. Steve Carroll. It's hard to distinguish incredible actors in sitcoms and comedies, but this is one show that demonstrates how talented Caroll is and how wide his range also is by now. One cannot love Scott without loving Caroll who created his different version that David Brent of the BBC original.

This show is so compulsively able to be rewatched due to Michael Scott as each one of us fall in love with his character, especially with all his imperfections.

But without the ensemble, Michael Scott would lack all the historical episodes he made our guts ache. My personal favorite in the background is Stanley. How genius of a casting choice. But then Jim Halpert may be just as genuis as Steve Carroll as Jim is infamous for the perfect timing of looking at us to make the scene all the more awkward. Somenting Scott and him do the best.

I'm not sure there was a more heartwarming scene then Michael and Heidi proposal. Jim pranking Dwight, i.e. the magic lagoons or beans as Dwitght waters the four plants and then Jim replaced them with full grown trees.

Is there a more tortured character than Toby? In a scene in which Robert California listed Toby's name on the left side of the paper, ""the winners"". Toby announces at the table in the restaurant as they're celebrating, that he needs to excuse himself and he was never here because hes so conditioned at this point from years of Michael's abuse.

Stanley's glaring at Andy's back as he speaks to Erin at reception saying do not look at Stanley I accidentally filled in his sudoku.

What always appealed to me though, was how the show crossed the line and seemed fearless. In what consider the office as a cringe inducing show, I find it so refreshing that off colored jokes were inlcuded. It is my favorite comedy ever, and one I compare shows to capturing its atmosphere or tone. Many comedies have been born because of the #inspiration of this. The mockementary style filming is another character on it's own and a device I feel is underused in comedies today.

The office featured one of the best ensembles with comedy's following trying to feature stellar ensembles realizing after nine years of the office, it's the characters created that will give the show its run for the money. No other comedy since has been able to create a character as significant as Michael Scott to lead a show.

The office is a series much like friends is for a lot of people, that is simply part of your life as we incorporate it into our lives each year upon a rewatch knowing it will provide a warm fuzzy comfy world in which we're able to retreat from reality and escape to Dunder Mifflin.",literal
"This show feels like a hug I miss my mother, I hope to see her some day soon, A show that taught me how to live life in a surprising way, the way I should have lived it while I had the chance.

I can watch this show for motivation, inspiration, sadness and probably every other emotion you want in the world.

I don't even know how to thank the person who recommended this to me and specially the ones who spent a greater part of their lives making this possible.

It is a little underrated, as it overlapped the release of other major Sitcom FRIENDS, but if you like the kind of shows without a laughter track, do give it a chance.

It's a comfort show.",literal
"Starts of well but later seasons ""Woke"" This is a long running Showtime series which really started off well with clever writing and life-like characters that really make you become emotionally invested in their stories. Unfortunately, after Season 6, the series started to go downhill. By Season 8. it became all about ""messaging"" and ""education"", and ultimately too political. The final straw (or nail in its coffin) came in Season 9 with the departure of Emmy Rossum. Seasons 10 and 11 are like watching a once great show as it falls into a death spiral, writhing in throes of a painful death! The series then just manages to limp to the end, literally force feeding the viewers heavy doses of political correctness in every episode. Despite this failure, it is still worth a watch because of the good acting that brings the characters to life.",literal
"Downward spiral Season one was fun and entertaining. I just finished season 2... hardly. It just went all over the place. This person is fighting this person, but then this guy is partners with this guy but these two guys are trying to kill each other but now they are meeting up oh and everyone has each others number and just calls each other all the time. There are like 5 different groups of people all in and out of each others business. It's just a horrible mess. The humor is super cringe. The writing is just bad. I will not be participating in season 3.",literal
"Smart and Entertaining I must be honest: Initially I was skeptical about yet another romance comedy from Netflix. The track record on this genre is largely badly written stories compounded by lead actors with little to no chemistry.

I was so happy that this is not the case with ""Nobody Wants This"". Likely a tongue-in-cheek title from the producers who recognize the generally subpar quality of this type of movies or series.

Kudos must be given to the writers, directors, and the actors - both lead and supporting cast. I totally bought into the chemistry between Kristen Bell's and Adam Brody's characters from the very beginning.

They pulled off something special here: A smartly written and entertaining romance comedy that is completely believable and engaging. There were a few brief moments where I was worried. But thankfully it didn't end up being too cliche.

I can't wait for Season 2!",figurative
"Average Show Lukewarm attempt to be the Irish version of Succession, but it didn't quite get the job done. The series appeared to focus on entertaining the teenage/twenty-something demographic.

"Oh Ricky... what hast though done? Sorry to be just another person to slag this off but I can't help it. I'm glad for Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchants success with The Office in other countries, but surely they cant be over the moon about how this version turned out. I've read them saying they like it, but then what else can they say.

In my opinion there was no point in even basing it on the original because the main elements that make The Office so freaking good are all lost in translation. There's no subtlety and the characters don't have the dimensions that they did in the original. 

I must say I find Steve Carell pretty good, but thats down to his own comedy timing. The rest of the cast is below par, and I cant stand the Gareth equivalent. He is so annoying!!! In the original, Gareth is such a w*nker... in a hilarious way..... in the US version, he's such a w*nker..... in a freaking irritating way.

Must everything be so over the top in the US? does that make me a racist? Nah cause i LOVE Seinfeld... best sitcom ever! But on ""The Office"", I think you're out of your element.",figurative
"Too much suspension of disbelief The premise is good, but to believe that someone so successful and obviously smart would never catch on, is asking too much.

Beyond that, that are too many unanswered questions that just ask too much of the audience. I could point out a dozen, but bother? This ""could have been great"" plot is not worth it.",figurative
"Awesome start It's like ""Dallas"" but it's in Midland. It's west Texas oil and Billy Bob Thornton, and they even threw in a little football. What more could you want? It's really well filmed and, so far, the cast is very realistic. I'm just hoping it doesn't get ruined like Yellowstone with petty spoiled brat infighting and year long gaps between episodes or seasons. If the writing can stay the course this could be a really good show with many seasons. I'm hoping the daughter gets shipped off to college or something. Her behavior is really disgusting, but look at her Mom. Apple...tree. Interesting use of Jon Hamm, Demi Moore, and Micheal Peña.",literal
"Less is always more First season was great. The second season was very good. The third season was fine but improved. This last season is a complete disappointment. It's all over the place and it just lost its way.

Way too many actors trying to get a piece of the action and the plot was sacrificed.

The story just seems to go nowhere.

I really loved this show and even tried watching this new season because I love Steve Martin and Martin Short despite Selena Gomes's lack of acting skills and lame voice. But I just couldn't make it past episode 7.

Not even Meryl Streep can save this season. It should have stayed just the three actors with an occasional guest appearance on each season or even a few episodes but not essential to the story. I mean the show was supposed to be about the three main characters and them solving cases.

Maybe the screenwriters were changed who knows but this just seems like a completely different show and just not worth watching past the first three seasons.",literal
"Edgar nailed it I loved the 80's Arnie yarn. Used to watch it every day as a kid. Then read the book and realised it was totally different. When they announced the remake and it was rumoured that they'd stay true to the book I got very excited. I'm happy to say that Edgar Wright smashed it. My wife came along and usually watches action movies just to stop me looking like a lone wierdo in the cinema! She absolutely loved this movie, so that's all anyone needs to know. I dare say the low reviews will be politically motivated like the recent One Battle After Another low scores. On merit, this movie can't be scored any lower than a 7 or 8/10. If you like a good King adaptation, this will impress. No doubt about it!",literal
"I don't understand the hype on this one National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation is a holiday movie that many cherish for its over-the-top humor and nostalgic charm. Chevy Chase delivers his signature blend of slapstick and sarcasm as Clark Griswold, a family man determined to create the perfect Christmas. The film captures the chaos and dysfunction of holiday gatherings in a way that feels relatable to many.

However, while there are undeniably funny moments, much of the humor relies on gags that can feel dated or excessively over-the-top. The film's pacing is uneven, with some scenes dragging while others rush through potentially meaningful moments. The supporting characters, while quirky, are often reduced to one-note caricatures, making it hard to fully invest in the story.

While Christmas Vacation has its moments of holiday magic and laugh-out-loud scenes, it doesn't consistently deliver the heart or sharp wit of the best holiday comedies. For fans of slapstick and 1980s humor, it's an enjoyable watch, but for others, it might fall a little short. A 5/10 for its mix of festive fun and missed potential.",figurative
"Henry Cavill deserves 10/10 the writers barely deserve 1/10 Its honestly crazy that the writers for the later seasons wanted to make Geralt and Cerie (the child he rescues in the first season and helps raise for the next several) have a romantic relationship so Henry Cavill departed from the show. Who knows if they are going to continue with that trash storyline but it should be said this show was good enough to make my wife (who could care less about fantasy) interested for the first two seasons. The show has taken a downward turn since then though those first two seasons are quite enjoyable with a great cast and honestly great effects. The monster fights are next level and the sword fights are even better so thats why I say it deserves 10/10, plus Cavill is the man and the rest of the cast make this such a great show.",literal
"It was okay Congratulations to the show for having a second season unfortunately I won't be watching.

The show has a very big problem that most other shows have: they made the crime investigation too simple and too easy. In addition to this, Karl's six sense was too strong. He could tell what was relevant and what the next step was. In reality, detectives get flows of info, too many suspects or no suspect at all. Even they have a suspect and bring to question, without solid evidence, they will deny everything. Also with so much info, they don't know where to start. Reality trains are derailed in this show.

Karl Alberg is a great cop. Hardworking, smart, experienced, pursing truth and justice. He sometimes weights his job more than his family, including his daughter and his girlfriend. He also doesn't really care about how he looks. Can you imagine he doesn't dress up and comb his hair before going to work? In his head, solving cases is everything.

The show also reflect some issues that the modern society has. For example, hybristophilia (episode 6 of season 1), and spreading false information about sth people don't know about on social media (episode 7 of season 1) due to their uncontrollable fear and uncertainty, before the truth reveals. While watching they unveil mysteries, paying attention to this unnoticeable details is also good.

Season 1 was either not too good or too bad. I hope season 2 is gonna be amazing.",literal
"Disappointing Season 2 Season One was brilliant, so I had high hopes and looked forward to Season Two. Unfortunately the first four episodes of Season Two were very weak. Luckily it did pick up and finished strong. Hopefully Season Three can return to the brilliance of Season One.

Season Two does provide some excellent character development and backstory.",figurative
"I never give 10s I absolutely LOVE this show! I wasn't interested, but decided to give it a try. I am so glad I did. I don't want the episodes to end. Great acting, and great story. 10!",literal
"Wildly logically inconsistent and the main character is a moron. The concept could potentially have been executed well, but this is not it. I'm bewildered by the high reviews.

Maybe it will somehow redeem itself in future episodes, but I'm not sure that's possible.

I don't do spoilers, so I won't mention specifics. Definitely watch it and form your own opinion since some clearly enjoy it.",literal
"Had promise Had promise but at this point there is not one character relatable or likeable. Show blatant hate towards certain patients for no reason and others are completely babied. The hate being inserted as if it's justified throughout episodes is incredulous. I love Noah wyles work and though some characters were very dynamic and interesting, it has been completely erased throughout the 6 episodes I have watched. I had high hopes, and they have been squandered. The concept is a great idea but the writing and portrayal of events is lack luster. There are several characters that I thought were going to be fantastic and I was excited, but it's been all downhill. I don't know if I can watch the rest. I hope the show has success with other viewers, just won't be me.",literal
"Excellent Excellent show. Crossover between CPD and CM is brilliant coz it made me watch them. Chicago Fire is very realistic and human. Perfect build up of characters and sub plots and cross over between other two Chicago series. My fev characters are all except Gabby Dawson and Peter Mills. Gabby was interesting in first lap of show but after her miscarriage she lost it. As headstrong as her brother in CPD. Anatonio. She took many major decisions without consulting her husband Mathew and blames him for all. Same way Antanio acts very sacrosanct and honest in PD. But when it comes to commitment both just runs away blaming others. Mathew is man of principle,Kelly is very interesting. Silvie ,Stella,Herman,Mouch,Boden,Otis every charactor is perfectly placed and developed. Sub plots are very interesting. Chicago PD started very intense and complex but newest season is loosing it's grip. Very contrived plots and stories. Chicago Fire is no doubt must watch.",literal
"It's so hard to rate even 9 to this show, because it's so unique & revolutionary. Even though the last season was horrible, I can't ignore the greatness of the Show. Writer George R. R. Martin did nearly a perfect job creating this franchise: A Song of Fire and Ice.

Also HBO adapted it beyond well. It was revolutionary. I bet you couldn't find this type of TV show at that time. It felt like Cinema. It was just revolutionary. I didn't see this type of quality in any TV Show. The closest one was Band of Brothers. Even other HBO projects can't compete with Game of Thrones that easily. After a decade later, I still believe this is the biggest revolution on TV series.

Ramin Djawadi's stunning Original Scores makes the serie two times better.

All the Costume, Makeup and Set Decorations brings too much realistic style to a Fantasy world.

Cinematography is just like painting with all colors instead of just red. As you may know, Ser Barristan Selmy uses only one color in painting. :)

Some of the underrated actors just showed their skills to the whole world since this is the most popular TV Show of all time.

The storyline is not that easy to explain. It's just amazingly detailed and full of great twists. Not all the twists are great, sadly the last season showed us that isn't the case. But besides last season, the twists were pretty great. I know Season Seven was also had so many weak sides and non logic parts. But even Season Seven was great if you're comparing with some other TV show. It's just worse than other seasons, yes I'm aware Arya and Sansa were acting to each other for no reason. These logicless parts started with Season Five actually. But they were ""could be ignored"" type of flaws, were'nt major flaws. I think the greatest season was Season Six with amazing battle episode and the great Bran's vision scene. Even though Season Six also had minor flaws, it's still the greatest for me. As I said these flaws didn't started in Season Seven as many people believe. The flaws started on Season Five. It just evolved to middle flaws in Season Seven. And these flaws evolved into something I've never witnessed before in Season Eight. I don't know how to describe these flaws. Sadly the last season is just unwatchable. It's enough to watch one time, I don't think anyone wants to see twice. It's was the worst way to end the show sadly, I actually believe if someone would tried to make a worse season, it'll be so hard to make a worse story.

Eventually we get the Game of Thrones shock effect. But this time wasn't the good way like in The Red Wedding. This time the twist was the horrible story writing.

So why did I rate 10/10 after the last season? Because I accepted Season Six was the peak and the show ended in there for me. It's so hard to rate even 9 to this show, because it's so unique, revolutionary and effective. I can't just ignore all those great things. I'm not saying this show doesn't deserve any criticizing. It surely does. It deserves all those negative ratings and reviews. But personally, I can't even rate 9 because as I mentioned I can't ignore all the greatness in the show. You may consider my thoughts silly, it's okay but you know what? When I was watching the show with my brother, I saw those bad endings coming from the first two episodes. People just saw that in the fifth episode of the season. This show killed three main characters in a wedding episode. Did you really expect this? In The Long Night, the most important character that die was Jorah Mormont. Still not even important as Robb Stark. All those years we've waited for these moments. The first episode of the first season called ""Winter Is Coming"" and this story shouldn't be about the Throne because it's about the great enemy. What did change after the events of The Long Night, that long waited winter? Nothing changed at all.

The other enormous flaw was about Jon Snow. Why did you just made him son of a Targaryen and a Stark? If he is not the rightful King, why should we care about him?

Jamie Lannister also gone after the war without any reason.

They really killed all those characters one by one. But still I can't rate 9 because I choose to forget the last season. Just like I'm ignoring The Sequel Trilogy in Star Wars, I'm also ignoring the existence of the last season of Game of Thrones.",figurative
"trying desperately hard to be more intelligent than it is Overall a showman of a film. Flashy, loud with bells and whistles and big personalities, an exciting premise... illusionists rob banks using (supposed) magic but the four horsemen are just puppets in a game, but the hype is more than the substance of the film itself.

You'd expect suspense, twists, intelligent plot misdirection and all sorts of thrilling viewing? No. This film tries to be a lot more intelligent than it actually is. Like Atlas (Eisenberg) says, ""Always be the most intelligent person in the room"" or something similar, this film thinks it is being intelligent but actually it's not challenging enough. It gives too much away, isn't as unpredictable as it should be (really, you couldn't see that ending coming?) and just isn't as clever as it promises. The tricks I really wanted explaining weren't... the ones that were more obvious, were explained. The ending actually isn't a denouement, as it's been laying clues all along - and anyone who's seen a lot of films can see the ""twists"" coming a mile away. I focus on the twists and reveal because as a heist movie, the end is the big reveal. But, unlike Oceans Eleven, for example, it has more or less handed it to you on a plate already.

The actors were good. Morgan Freeman and Woody Harrelson stealing the show, of course, with Dave Franco doing a bang up job with some incredible physical acting, stunts and so forth. I'm afraid Jesse Eisenberg didn't convince in his character and was annoying after a while, Franco rather underutilised really. Isla Fisher was good but clearly the ""glamour"" rather than a serious character, which was a shame as she was good.

This was supposed to be a big blockbuster film, big back drops, epic stunts and huge crowd scenes, but it failed to deliver. As heist/magic genre films go it's not that great, and The Prestige was far more cerebral and gripping. Entertaining to a point but I got a bit bored, and some of the scenes were too long - chases etc. If you are a fan of heist films or magic you'll enjoy it, or are a fan of particular actors, or will just enjoy it for what it is and don't want to be challenged intellectually, it's a great film. I think Hollywood endings are just too commonplace. 6/10 for me.",literal
"Don't believe the bad ratings! Don't believe any of those bad ratings this is just about anger reaction to the season 8 and forget what ""game of thrones"" really deserves.",literal
"Better watch this Had heard nothing but amazing things about 'Better Call Saul' (with nothing bad), with it being one of the most highly regarded shows in recent years. Am a huge fan of 'Breaking Bad', so was really psyched in seeing its prequel 'Better Call Saul' too. My opinion of Bob Odenkirk is also very high, so there was absolutely no way this was going to be missed. Have binged on many shows in the past seven years or so and was determined for this to be one of them, very like 'Breaking Bad'.

'Better Call Saul' was every bit as amazing as reputed. Have seen many shows that started off wonderfully but declined badly in their final seasons, a few with really bad last episodes ('House of Cards', 'Game of Thrones', 'Killing Eve'), but then there are rarities like 'Breaking Bad' where every season was at least positively received and on the most part universally acclaimed. 'Better Call Saul' is another one of the rarities and is the first show seen in a long time to not have a bad episode in it, since 'Breaking Bad'. Seriously compelling and addictive stuff and exceptional in every area.

Visually, 'Better Call Saul' is one of those shows that is both stylish and beautiful, with photography and editing that are cinematic quality and put a lot of films today to shame, where there are a lot of visually beautiful ones but also some painfully amateurish looking ones. The music always has the appropriate mood, never too intrusive, never too muted.

The writing for 'Better Call Saul' is a fine example to all shows of how to have a lot of style but also to have a lot of substance. The dialogue throughout is thought-provoking and tense, although quite talky, while also have a darkly wicked sense of humour and heart-tugging pathos. The stories are texturally rich, intimate, tense and layered, with the pace of them consistently deliberate but taut. The pull no punches and gritty approach to the subject was often chilling and harrowing to watch. The direction couldn't be better.

Likewise with the acting, with Odenkirk on absolutely towering form throughout as one of television's most fascinating and meatiest leading characters, one that one is repulsed by but also one that is not hard to sympathise with in some situations. Rhea Seehorn and Michael McKean are excellent as well, McKean giving one of his best work in years. The character writing is rich and compellingly real.

Concluding, truly outstanding show. 10/10.",figurative
"Chad Powers episodes It turned out to be a very good series, but these 6 episodes were very few. I suggest to the producers that the next season should have at least 10 episodes, if not more, and the length of the episodes should be more than 40 minutes! There is a lot of potential in the series, it would be a shame to let it go to waste!! Go Powers!! You are the best! I would watch this series 0-24!",literal
"MASTERPIECE Best writing , Best characters , best drama , best crime , best of comedy . The best tv show ever",figurative
Underwhelming I am a big fan of GDT and his canon of work and there is much to like in Frankenstein but at the end I found it all rather underwhelming. The last 10 mins of sickly sentimentality actually annoyed me. I couldn't help thinking that Oscar Isaac was wrong for the part of Victor Frankenstein and the 'monster' never felt like a properly formed character (pun intended). All in all it's disappointing.,literal
"Hooked by ep 2 I will start by saying I have no knowledge of this real story and cannot speak to accuracy. What I will say is it is a slow burn and intriguing look at the dynamics of money, power, addiction, dysfunction and the truth behind the headlines. Yes, it is a dramatization, but it is peeling away a facade that it seems the family was trying to keep in place, even among each other. I am avoiding researching the true events to stay engaged with the process. I will say that whether or not a true depiction of the real person (I have no reference point), Clarke is extraordinary and I feel worthy of an Emmy.",literal
"Timo Tjahjanto Turns Nobody 2 Into a Perfect Blend of Grit, Laughs & Mayhem ""Nobody 2"" is in the perfect hands with Timo Tjahjanto at the helm, and it shows. He delivers a film that's perfectly balanced-drama that hits, comedy that lands, and action that absolutely rips.

The gore? Present in just the right amount-enough to make the action visceral without tipping into overindulgence. The highlight for me, as both a hip-hop and action film fan, was the samurai showdown between RZA and Daniel Bernhardt-a sequence that's as stylish as it is electrifying.

And of course, Bob Odenkirk anchors the chaos with another fabulous performance, blending everyman vulnerability with sheer action-hero ferocity. He turns this into an action fest with genuine emotional weight.

Timo has elevated the Nobody franchise into something sharper, bloodier, and unexpectedly heartfelt.",literal
"I'm a rabid fan but... This season was...meh. The standoff in the records warehouse was amateur hour. C'mon people, you're waaaay better than this. None of it plausible, believable, well written or well directed. 2nd unit maybe? I recall Shirley's character being established as badass, which I was on board with and anxiously awaited more ass-kicking from her but she got ""lucky"" in her fight scene with a broken CD? And also, as a badass, shouldn't she have some military background or training that would prevent her from looking like she's never handled a weapon before? That's the Directors fault but Producers should never have allowed that to fly. The whole concept of the Slow Horses defeating 20 soldiers was just idiotic. C'mon people get it together on season 4 please. Xoxo.",literal
I used to love this show. It went downhill after they killed Ziva.. then Anthony left.. But when they replaced Abby with a similar character named Kasie I really started to hate it... Gave it a 7 because I used to love it.,literal
"Slowly downhill after the first season Most of the glowing reviews here were written in the first season, which was excellent.

Without giving anything important away I'll say that the concept of the series is solid and interesting -- rejects of the British intelligence service are complex and lovable and . . . Surprise they do some things very well.

The problem with the series is that it quickly becomes formulaic: An agent is sent to the Slow Horses department where they are belittled by Gary Oldman. Something bad happens. Everyone underestimates the Slow Horses. They unexpectedly shine. Rinse and repeat over and over, with no explanation of why nobody recognizes their brilliance.

Related, as the seasons churn on we never hear anything about other MI-5 units that should presumably be working the cases. The only thing that MI-5 HQ ever does is send in ""the dogs"" who are the militarized grunts who break things and shoot people.

Also, Gary Oldman's character has become far too perfect. He's grumpy and doesn't care about anyone and then when everything is about to fail he shows up to bonk someone on the head. That strains realism too much for me.

This series overall is a solid 7 for me. Worth watching but with tempered expectations.",figurative
"Much better than expected Surprisingly good and well made show. It looks like well thought out and planned too.

Characters have depth, stories and back stories, acting is good, production value is high. Accuracy to the world of Fallout is immaculate. The world of Fallout is being introduced to TV quite well, and the story is slowly expanding. Occasionaly overly intricate, while the good side of that, is that following seasons will continue on story-rich.

Use of practical props and amount those made for the show is admirable.

Show as a whole with no major flaws, can be upgraded to even higher levels.",literal
"KK tried her best So let me say I am definitely for women empowerment. The concept is good. What makes this series miss the mark in my opinion is...why would Ryan Murphy cast KK with all these amazing and talented G. O. A. T. S ?....she is a rookie actress. I will say she was good in American Horror Story. However one can see that this series was created around KK.

I am sure Ryan Murphy thought this would be great for her to get further into an acting career. Now Ryan you are a friend of Kris so I get it. Do you think matching KK with these first class actors enhances her acting for other produces and directors to see her at her best in comparison to her fellow actors?

Wonder what Ryan was thinking? Just sayin'...Kudos for for the effort! I rated 5 instead of 4 for the effort put into this series....",literal
"SORRY TO SAY THIS IS A LOSER WITH JUST A LOT OF AS USUAL ETHAN HAWKE SCREAMING AT THE TOP OF HIS LUNGS ABOUT THINGS.

It's really boring & VERY PREDICTABLE. 2 THUMBS DOWN & NOT RECOMMENDED... We honestly wish there were more things that were positive about this movie that we could add, but there isn't. It's just sad that this much talent, with this many cast members is this bad.",literal
"Misses what this story is about completely There... I dissed a Ron Howard movie. Usually a Ron Howard film dictates quality and a light-hearted touch. This is just heavy handed and makes this story into something it was never meant to do.

This is a story about the spirit of Christmas. In the original story, all the Who's of Whoville are not phased by their loss of decorations, libations and gifts. They come together and through their genuine spirit of love, come together, and it is this that makes the Grinch's heart grow.

The movie gives a background to the Grinch... and to boot blames the Whovillians for the Grinch's bad attitude. So wrong and flawed.

The character of Cindy Lou Who builds on that and further impunes the citizens of Who-ville. tsk tsk tsk. That is not the innocent of the original story.

The narration while interesting completely re-writes a beautiful story...tsk tsk tsk Dr. Seuss was right not to let this story be re-told.

The odd thing is that this story could have been abstracted into something altogether different ... much like the re-telling of another Christmas classic... Scrooge.

But no... the theme was used and abused and ended up with a sad tale.",figurative
"Loved Yellowstone, 1882, Love Billy Bob but argh Landman - honestly - what is going on? I was so keen to watch this show, particularly because Taylor Sheridan wrote it. But as a mother with young daughters - I mean, what the hell? A young twenty something in Victoria's Secret lingerie prancing around in front of a - sorry mate, if I'm wrong? 70 year old?! So off-putting. I couldn't actually watch for very long, felt erk, and I'd been a VERY big fan of Yellowstone, and 1882. I'm SO disappointed. I wanted you to get on with the story of the oil industry, which I really was so engaged in. Creepy old guys trying to resist the temptation of a young girl in lingerie in the pantry, I mean - what on earth were you thinking?! Horrible.",literal
"To those giving this 1 star I'm basing my review on the 1st episode, plus 10 minutes of ep 2.

To those who find it boring, how about you do two things:

1. Remember it's 2 episodes in.

2. Refer to Rubicon, which was ""snoozefest"" as well until the groundwork was built upon, at which point all the interconnected threads started to pay off and the show became absolutely sublime.

In short, give it a chance. I LOVED episode 1, and I'm sure I'm going to like the rest as well.",literal
"Great show, somewhat diminished by political correctness First of all, after three seasons, I really enjoy this show. It's got Nathan Fillion and a host of other likeable actors, and a decent story. It's fun, it's light and it always leaves me wanting more, as a good show should.

That being said, the magic is constantly broken by their incessant need for female empowerment. As one character mentioned, women make up only about 12% of law enforcement and yet, in this show, they're over-represented to such an extent that one can't help but feel frustrated because they're always present, always right and always boring with their moral, intellectual and, often, physical superiority.

Regardless of this issue, I do recommend this show to anyone looking for a bit of fun and distraction. I just wish they'd tone down the socio-political agenda to make it a bit more palatable.",literal
"Just what the doctor ordered! First of all, THANK YOU for creating this show! I recorded this show hoping for a win. This show is the Mega Million Lottery winner!

Each day I vow to keep doing the right thing and keep hope alive. This TV show offers me ""mind candy"". More than entertainment, St Denis Medical makes me laugh. The kind of laughter that is healing. An opportunity for my spirits getting renewed, revived, and restored. NBC, I'm using my teacher voice here and I'm giving you my best teacher stare.

"A decent sci-fi movie for that time My ratings for The Running Man are based on what you could do in 1987. If they would remake this movie with the technology they have now they could probably add much more futuristic elements to it. But for 1987 this was a good sci-fi movie. Stephen King might have written this story but the movie isn't quite the same story at all. But the major point is there, a falsely accused prisoner is running, in a televised game show, to avoid different killers with special features. It's entertaining and a good view on how modern society is now, that is reality tv where people are being brainwashed by the media. Arnold Schwarzenegger isn't a great actor, at least not to me, but it's only fair to admit he's been in some quality sci-fi movies.",literal
"A show filled with humour, romance and fun I personally enjoy this fun filled show. It makes you laugh and as soon as I watched a bit I just kept wanting to watch more!

The characters are so much fun- Lorelai and Rory Gilmore who are mother and daughter live in a small town called Stars Hollow and the show takes us through theirs and their family and friends lives. Rory and Lorelai have a best friend relationship and they have a blast together drinking coffee and having movie nights. There is also a lot of romance, drama and a lot of guys throughout the seven years of the show.

The cast are very good at acting out their roles, especially Alexis Bledel who plays Rory Gilmore as Gilmore Girls was her first TV show and you wouldn't be able to tell as all of the cast are great actors/ actresses .

My only criticism is that sometimes it is hard to understand what is going on as sometimes the characters talk very quickly, especially Lorelai Gilmore but this is just because she is an excitable character who drinks a lot of coffee!

"More Shows Like This Please Top to Bottom excellent. I wish I would have waited and binged the whole series. It would be a crime not to do another season.

"Agree with reviewer that it's hard to watch sober... This is so poorly written. Nothing about it is even the tiniest bit researched or realistic. Knowing a bit about FBI and police procedures, the total failure to write this with any authenticity or any basis in reality makes me feel like they think their viewers are stupid.

This is lowest common denominator writing. I spent the entire last episode yelling at the tv about how ridiculous each consecutive scene was. Each dumber and more unbelievable than the last.

I'm totally willing to suspend disbelief for a well written interesting premise- I like the lead actor and wanted to like this. But I cringe now when I watch.

There's so much crap being made and so much content. Very few things worth a damn. I didn't expect much from this, just mindless entertainment, but it is a big disappointment none-the-less.",literal
"Warning This movie has artificially inflated ratings. Don't take my word for it. Read the reviews yourself and then look at the number. I love so many of these actors but this movie has no soul.

"Reinvents the ""golden age"" of UK TV The original Poldark was from what I would describe as the ""golden age"" of UK television. Poldark sat happily alongside wonderful series like Upstairs and Downstairs, The Onedin Line, The Duchess of Duke St and War and Peace. 

Set in 18th century Britain, Ross Poldark, played by Aidan Turner, is a nobleman who shuns social convention. Ross's warmth and his ability to see the true humanity in people, is in stark contrast to the callous, class based snobbery of many of his supposedly, noble peers. 

Poldark is at its core a romance but it avoids the ""bodice ripper"" label by maintaining a very grounded approach to romantic storytelling mixing in a strong social commentary and wry humour.

The cast of Poldark are to a man and women excellent. Turner is exceptional as Poldark. As is Eleanor Tomlinson who offers up an at times very funny but also deeply touching performance, as Demelza. The remaining cast which is both UK and international, are also extremely talented and well suited to their respective roles.

In summary, this is a superb series. It recaptures the golden age of UK television, for those of us old enough to remember it.For those who do not, you are in for a real treat. 10 out of 10 from me.",literal
They will be studying this show in schools. The amount of thought and care in Better Call Saul elevates it above other great TV shows into one of the modern classics in storytelling.

I could write for hours but you just have to trust me on this: go watch it!!,literal
"Jurassic World: Afterbirth This film is your typical Hollywood cash grab. No decent plot or dialogue.

There is some random family just out in restricted Waters with no explanation why they are there to the plot.

Shame on the writers to turn such a rich world & complicated structure into a pale & dumb pop-ish work at the last 2 seasons

Seasons 1-6 outstanding. season 7 that's when the dumb writing has begun. season 8 dumb writing has taken a whole new level, butchering all characters arcs & betraying the previous complexity of the world.

"The Good Guys Win Too Much!!!! This is a television show which has a lot going for it, the format is pretty cut and dry... These emotionless figureheads, who work for the law, have to divide their time between plea bargaining, and becoming nauseated, yet detached, from the situations that they must cope with!! .. What is so realistic about this show is their astute depiction of due process!! The monotony involving the burden of proof becomes relegated to cumbersome nuisances which many city workers and appointed officials must expedite, in order to maintain peace and tranquility, or, as the show is entitled, law and order!!!! It is only for the television audience's benefit that the district attorneys in this show deviate from the norm, and demonstrate even a modicum of vigilante fervor!! The deals that the state makes with the defendants wind up being an in veritable jackpot of justice for the city of New York!! This is because the T.V. viewer has an insatiable craving to witness something which is remotely similar to a happy ending!! I give this series credit for being realistic in it's accurate portrayal of the arraignments, the trials, and the deliberation processes which inevitably adhere to an acceptable limit of legal authenticity!! Hence, the show later proceeds to indulge the prosecution with an eleemosynary generosity for purposes of conveying some sort of socially responsible message to the viewer!! While the scenario becomes a situation of ""The good guys winning too much"" these victories by the prosecution are candidly conditional, and therefore, very relevant in their overall premise!! You (The viewer) can thoroughly conceptualize how deliberations through the judicial system operate in New York City by watching ""Law & Order"" .... That is something you can count on!!! ABSOLUTELY!! No question about it!! This is one of the essential purposes of ""Law & Order""

""Law & Order"" has lasted for seventeen seasons, and is still one of the best television shows on the small screen!!! I think the dialog is extremely gripping, and the lethal oblivion to moral imperatives have left a crystal clear indication of how accommodating justice requires many dubious and distasteful compromises!! The district attorney must acquiesce to deals with a very sordid and nefarious cross section of felonious criminals in order to stay within the guidelines of statutory budget appropriations!!! Sometimes, the most apocalyptic and pitiful situations are what determine the outcome of a case!! The cacophony of hateful emotional hang-ups almost serve as a precarious form of vindication for the purveyors of the various and heinously orchestrated crimes that this series continuously manufactures !! Regardless of what happens, officials of the law have to bite the bullet, hold their noses, and look the other way!! Primarily, this is the obligatory scourge that the public officials on this show must capitulate to!! Such a plight correlates to actual dilemmas that our nation's public officials must struggle with!! One of the most prolific statements uttered on ""Law & Order"" was (I am paraphrasing) ""The wealthy do not have an extreme overabundance of justice, the goal of due process is to simply raise the level of justice for the common man"" I wholeheartedly agree with that statement!! It is a fact that in so many instances, with so many trials, plausibility for manifesting reasonable doubt has become intensely convoluted, and thus, has become an egregious bastardization of the American legal system!! Whether we like to admit it or not, television is an informative element of social exposure for the average American. ""Law & Order"" is a program which delves into prosecution proceedings at a rudimentary level of societal poignancy!! In it's own right, it (""Law & Order"") throughout it's entire run, has auspiciously changed much of the formulae of television programming by elevating it to a relatively significant degree of egalitarian accuracy!! Most shows do not possess the fortitude to be that influential, not by any stretch of the imagination whatsoever!! The ensuing spin-offs of ""Law & Order"" have been very excellent as well!!

I like the series ""Law & Order"" ... In particular, I like some of the cast members like Chris Noth, Dennis Farina, and Chris Meloni!! Both Sam Waterson and Michael Moriarity have been excellent on this show too!! The directing, producing and particularly, the writing, have been sensational on ""Law & Order"" I believe this is one of the top 50 shows ever to hit the airwaves....A definite trophy in the small screen drama showcase!!!",figurative

"A 'camel' of a series If a camel is (unfairly) described as a 'horse designed by a committee', this tv series is (fairly) described as a camel.

"Merry Christmas ! I watched How The Grinch stole Christmas. It's a good entertaining movie to watch this year. Ron Howard represented this colorful movie to his father. He remade this 1966 classic. Jim Carrey was chosen to be The Grinch. I think Jim Carrey was kind of odd and stupid in as the Grinch, but quite liked the clothes and the background made out by Custom Design and Art Direction and I found out that the Christmas meaning is not only the presents. It's about love. Family gets together for this wonderful Christmas every year. Family and family they sing the songs and eat foods. Christmas is for everyone including Grinch. Grinch looks ugly. People hate him and laugh at him. Grinch is just like those weak people in the society. May be we have to love them more. That's Christmas Soul !",literal
"Starts out as a 10, switches to a 7, ending is a 1 Had high hopes for this one, seen a few critics giving it a high rating.

It starts out great with good tension, keeps you on the edge of your seat, and deliveres great acting from the cast.

Then at a nerve-wrecking moment it shifts to another perspective, and that really dragged down the tension. I think this would have been better with a linear storyline. Switching between perspectives instead of dividing them into sections would have kept the tension higher throughout, bad call from the director..

The ending (without any spoilers) really ruined it for me. Could have been the movie of the year, but bad calls from the director drags it down to a 6.",literal
"One of greatest movies ever Movies nowadays generally lack what this movie has: charm talent and style. 80's produced incredible flicks like this likeno other decade could! And this is one of the narliest of them all! If you watch it again and again you will get dumbfounded at the minute enigmatic details hidden in scenes all throughout the movie. Very thoughtful, carefully crafted, bodacious 80's genius work of art! Rad acting by all involved, beautiful women that look like grown up women not forever teens, with fabulous hairdos, music that propels you back to the 80's. The detailed thought process that went into creating this deserves greatest reverence, because the director and writers really thought of everything, from inflation, to ID passes, to corporate fascism, it's all in here, simply remarkable and how much they hit the nail on the head of how it is today is astonishing. Public rating IS WAAAAAAY to low. I just like 80s and 90s graphics and special effects way more than the stuff they use today. The movie is perfect, the architecture is neat, as well as interior decor is fabulous 80's futurism, the mature looking people and style gives you the excellent 80s feel, it brings the viewer back to the 80's, it's closest thing to time travel. I for one would give it 10 oscars. TOTALLY and entirely under-appreciated. 21st century can't shine the shoes of 80's culture this flick in particular.",figurative
"An epic emotional Sci fi epic, and the best entry in the franchise since the first! Predator: Badlands is by far the best entry in the franchise since the original. It's a sci-fi epic masterpiece on its own - bold, emotional, and deeply original in its approach to the lore. By making the Predator the lead, the film opens up an entirely new perspective, exploring a different kind of Predator that stands apart from anything we've seen before. It dives deep into story, worldbuilding, and character, crafting an experience that's as thrilling as it is heartfelt.

The story is sublime - a true roller coaster of emotions, thrills, and chills. The pacing is perfect, starting with an unforgettable, epic, and emotional opening sequence (easily one of my favorites ever) and ending with an equally powerful and climactic finale. Between them, the film delivers a barrage of unique, glorious action sequences filled with adventure, humor, and rich character development.

The acting is outstanding, led by a stunning, Oscar-worthy performance from Elle Fanning in dual roles that once again showcase her extraordinary range, alongside an incredibly visceral performance by Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi.

Every aspect of the production screams Oscar potential - from its breathtaking design, sound, and blend of visual and practical effects to its unforgettable, epic score. Director Dan Trachtenberg once again proves he's the best thing that's ever happened to this franchise. Following his previous triumph with Prey, he outdoes himself here with direction that's nothing short of masterful. And with an ending that leaves the door open for a direct continuation, I can only hope he returns.",figurative
Great show Loved this series. Fabulous characters and story. Costumes and locations are exceptional.,literal
"Too much is too much In light of all of the recent gun violence, I wouldn't be surprised if this movie didn't do so well in theaters. The distributors should've delayed the release. While I watching the film, it was all I could think about and I wanted to leave the theater because of it. The deaths in the film are too similar to real life. If you've seen the Charlie Kirk assassination video, that is how realistic the deaths in this film are. I didn't care for it and found the amount of grisly gore to be in very poor taste.

Relentlessly graphic and disturbing, almost to the point of nauseating, in it's depiction of gun executions. Don't get me wrong, I've seen a lot of nauseating cinema in my day and quite enjoy it when it's done right. However, the violence in this film is so explicit and realistic, it actually takes away from the experience as a whole. This film would be a solid 8 if it wasn't so incredibly hard to watch.

It's sad really that the creators felt they needed the film to be so gruesome, because the film is quite good outside of that. The cast is solid, the cinematography is appropriately bleak and the writing is emotionally charged. My only critique on the writing is that I wish we could've been shown a bit more of the other character's backstorys. Yes, we get most of them explained to us, but I was hoping for the film to build more of a connection to the characters than what we got. I also wish the film had more of a point to it. There is a message there but it's muddled and muted.

Overall, if you do go see this film, prepare yourself. It is relentlessly bleak, depressing, disturbing, graphic and extremely violent. I'm not saying it's a bad film, it was actually quite good. However, it's muddled message about control did not justify the amount of ultra gruesome and disturbing deaths that plague this film. Too much is just too much and this film crosses that line too many times for me to outright recommend it.

"One of my top 3 shows!!! This show is not only hilarious but fascinating and I did learn some history from the ghosts, when I hear something from them I think is interesting I look it up. For example, Hetty is always talking about loving cocaine and I researched and found out it was once used for medical use and they mixed it with alcohol with us so weird because now days that is very bad. I learned that George Washington never knew about dinosaurs. I learned a lot about Vikings and I learned what puritans, cholera is and even more! I really love this show and I watch it on repeat because it's amazing. It's so cool how the ghosts are from completely different times and learning all their pasts and what is was like in their time is my favorite parts, there's a viking, a jazz artist from the 20s, a rich robber baron from the late 1800s, a Native American from the 1500s, a solider from the revolutionary war, a hippie from the 50s, a stockbroker that died in 2000 and a travel agent from the 40s.",literal
"But Not Here During the 1950s director Douglas Sirk was noted both for his accomplished use of colour and for the melodramatic nature of his plots in films like ""Magnificent Obsession"", ""Written on the Wind"", ""All that Heaven Allows"" and ""Imitation of Life"". ""Magnificent Obsession"" was a remake of a film from 1935, which I have never seen; both films are based upon a novel of the same name by Lloyd C. Douglas. The story is an essentially religious account of one man's redemption. The main character, Bob Merrick, starts off as a spoiled wealthy playboy, but eventually reforms, resumes his medical studies (which he abandoned when inherited his family fortune upon his father's death) and ends up as a brilliant surgeon, widely admired not only for his surgical skills but also for his kindness and philanthropy. 

A key figure in Merrick's redemption is Wayne Phillips, another brilliant surgeon, widely admired not only for his surgical skills but also for his kindness and philanthropy. In the 1935 film the doctor had the surname ""Hudson"", but this was changed to ""Phillips"" when Rock Hudson was cast as Merrick in this film, presumably because the studio felt that it would be confusing to have a character sharing a name with one of the film's stars. The more recent ""Margot at the Wedding"" is another example of the same phenomenon; it was originally to have been called ""Nicole at the Wedding"", but the name of the main character was changed when Nicole Kidman was cast in the role. Hudson seems to have been a favourite actor of Sirk, who used him in starring roles not only here but also in ""Written on the Wind"" and ""All that Heaven Allows"". 

Merrick never meets Dr Phillips, who does not actually appear in the film and who dies near the beginning, but both he and the audience hear a lot about the late doctor from his friends and family. According to them Dr. Phillips both preached and practised a philosophy of altruism, believing that to achieve anything worthwhile in life one needs to do good to others without hoping for anything in return, either in terms of financial reward or in terms of reputation. 

Hollywood may sometimes preach a gospel of altruism, but it has more difficulty practising it, and it has never been entirely comfortable with the doctrine that virtue is its own reward. Surely it must bring some more tangible rewards as well? Although, therefore, we never get to see Dr Phillips, we do get to see his house, and it turns out to be a magnificent lakeside villa, the sort of house I would more readily associate with the Bob Merricks of this world than with a self- sacrificing humanitarian who supposedly died relatively poor because of his generosity to others. 

An important factor in Merrick's transformation is the romance which develops between him and Phillips's widow Helen. I think that we are supposed to assume that Helen is considerably younger than Phillips, who had an adult daughter by a previous marriage, but nevertheless significantly older than Merrick. Rock Hudson was Hollywood's resident toyboy of the fifties and early sixties. At a time when ""boy meets girl"" usually meant ""older man meets girl young enough to be his daughter"", Hudson was regularly cast as the love-interest of actresses older than himself. Sometimes the age difference was only a minor one, as in his series of comedies with Doris Day, but sometimes it was more significant as with Jennifer Jones in ""A Farewell to Arms"" or with Jane Wyman here. (Hudson and Wyman were also cast together in ""All that Heaven Allows""). 

Sirk's work is characterised by careful composition of his images and his accomplished use of colour. His backgrounds are generally muted and dominated by greys and browns, but there is generally a prominent, brightly-coloured object in the foreground. In ""Written on the Wind"" this object is normally red, yellow or green, which gives a certain stylistic unity to that film, but here he uses colour more indiscriminately, with blues and purples also much to the fore. 

Despite Sirk's skill as a director, ""Magnificent Obsession"" is not a favourite of mine. The plot is excessively melodramatic and sentimental, too heavily reliant on coincidence and at times too improbable to be credible. The worst development comes when Merrick woos Helen, who has been blinded in an accident, under a false name without her (at first) realising his true identity and without any of her friends betraying his secret. Even more improbably she falls in love with a man whom she previously disliked, even though he was partly to blame for her accident. Special mention should be made of Frank Skinner's dreadful musical score, all lushly swooping strings and quasi-angelic choirs chanting ""Ah-ah-ah"", which intensifies the general atmosphere of corny sentimentality. In some of his films, such as ""Written on the Wind"" or ""Imitation of Life"", Sirk showed that he was capable of transforming melodrama into art. But not here. 5/10",figurative
"Victorian romance written by a man! I heard many people saying that Victorian novels like ""Pride and Prejudice"" or ""Sense and Sensibility"" are lovely and romantic. I don't agree. It's all about money and, for a change, a rich guy dating a less rich girl, both of course, from society. It's all about love letters, kisses under trees and everyone that who really works is invisible and disposable. ""Poldark"" shows a guy in love who lost almost everything. When he's about to run away, he realises that people depend on him to have food on their tables. He, then, rolls up his sleeves, go to work - ACTUAL manual work - and makes the difference. Of course, there are bankruptcy issues, death in the family and real love with a hardworking girl who couldn't even properly speak but had a huge heart. I can't wait for the next season. Right now, I'm on internet looking for his books.",literal
"Not peak John Hughes, but that's okay As John Hughes movies go, this one isn't Sixteen Candles or The Breakfast Club. But it's not bad. It's silly and has some laughs. Anthony Michael Hall seems slightly more mature here than in Sixteen Candles (I think he's all of one year older). It's fun to see a very young Robert Downey Jr. Being a bully. I wasn't a big fan of the Bill Paxton character - he was a bit one-note. The rest of the cast was pretty unknown to me. I do think this movie still holds up decently, more so than some other 80s movies. I'm sure the technology felt pretty advanced at the time. I do wonder what happened to the grandparents when everything went back to normal.",literal
"Television that's worth the time. Beautifully written, directed, photographed, acted, and produced. What more can be said? It's a very high quality program from almost every angle. Though hard to place in a genre, it may not be your genre of choice; however, the quality is undeniable. This season in Sicily had a more dramatic tone than the first, but was appropriate for the haunted feel that is Sicilia. I assume, as always, some will look to find fault or inappropriateness. In this season, that may include the choice of tying the writing to traditional Italian organized crime. I would ask them to take closer look before passing judgement, and to also take a deeper dive into the similar true stories that are at least as difficult to believe. The season was altogether excellent entertainment, methinks.",literal

"Hard to understand the popularity of the series In Nobody Likes This, Kristen Bell and Adam Brody team up in what is supposed to be a charming, heartfelt romantic comedy, but unfortunately, the only thing they manage to conjure is a deep sense of secondhand embarrassment. The film's title seems eerily prophetic, as it aptly reflects the overwhelming feeling of detachment that sets in around the fifteen-minute mark-and never goes away.

Kristen Bell, typically known for her quirky charm, is given a script so devoid of originality that her natural charisma gets buried under an avalanche of recycled tropes. Bell's character is yet another archetypal, clumsy-yet-relatable woman who is somehow unlucky in love. Her journey from awkward singlehood to predictable romance feels less like a story arc and more like a straight line-a flat, uninspired march toward a conclusion everyone saw coming within 10 minutes.

Adam Brody, who has long been typecast as the sarcastic yet lovable ""nice guy,"" delivers a performance that's as lifeless as the dialogue he's been handed. His chemistry with Bell is barely palpable, like two actors stuck in a rehearsed script rather than people destined for love. If you're hoping for witty banter, you'll be sorely disappointed. Instead, we get tired exchanges that feel like they've been recycled from every rom-com ever made, only here, they've been stripped of any charm or emotional depth.

In the end, Nobody Likes This is a series that embodies the very worst of the genre: formulaic, predictable, and utterly devoid of emotional substance. Kristen Bell and Adam Brody deserve better than this, and so does the audience. This is the kind of movie you forget about before the credits finish rolling-if you even make it that far.

To sum it up: the title doesn't lie. Nobody likes this.",figurative
"THE Best show I've ever watched. Aaron and Bryan did a perfect job at this. Vince execution and idea was perfect, and he created a masterpiece. The series ends perfectly, letting Walter die in his lab. The white family watches Walter loose his humanity, and it really shows. The acting is genuinely perfect, being funny and thrilling. I also think Skyler was a reasonable and well written character. She expresses how an average wife would react to their husband being a meth cook. The story had me constantly wanting more, and got me kinda sad when the series ended. Breaking bad is a good series following a hero that slowly becomes a villain.",figurative
"Glad I'm Single Great films make you think. They stay in your head and you discuss them for days. If it makes you sink down in your seat and watch from behind your hands you got your money's worth.

Jennifer Lawrence assumes the throne as the top actress in her craft. Her performance is raw, unnerving, embarrassing, funny, scary, incredible. If Liz Taylor in Virginnia Wolf or Suddenly Last Summer was entertaining for you see this. It's better/worse.

The cinematography is bleak and sad. It gives a feeling of being alone and great sadness.

The sound beats you up. Never ending baby crying, dog barking, flies buzzing. The song track flips from soft and pretty to loud and in your face.

The film jumps around so you don't know what is a flash back or isn't real. The wedding scene is mind blowing insanity.

"""Nobody signs up for it. Not really."" Certain advertisements for The Long Walk make sure to let us know that the original 1979 Stephen King novel was ""before Squid Game"" and ""before The Hunger Games"" -- heck, even before Battle Royale (of which The Hunger Games is regularly called a rip-off).

I understand wanting to dissuade uncultured Zoomers who might've misconstrued it for another rip-off (just look at what happened to poor old John Carter, whose 2012 film was dismissed as a Star Wars/Total Recall/Marvel knock-off despite its source material predating those things by decades). I also understand if King could use the ""ahead of his time"" praise right now. The question is, was the movie any good?

Well, for the most part, yes! A fair bit of it is straight-up excellent, particularly in terms of acting and the interplay between these characters. (There is a reason King is synonymous with memorable groups of youngsters, be they victims of a sadistic shapeshifter or young boys on a hike to find a dead friend's body.)

The film is set in an alternate, totalitarian version of 20th-century America. Its title refers to an event where young men from around the country participate in a 300-mile walk that must maintain a pace of 3mph, lest they be shot dead along the way -- all in the name of that precious ""national product""; of inspiring better productivity/work ethic around the nation. In other words, it is an arrangement where the punishment for poor productivity is death. You can probably figure out what the film is getting at with all this; the movie itself, at certain times, is a bit on-the-nose with it, but I find that sort of thing excusable in an ostensibly YA-geared tale.

Apparently this is all being broadcast to the rest of the world as entertainment, something that The Hunger Games probably clarified better. (All we know here is that there are cameras on the military vehicles that monitor the boys on their trek and... that's kind of it, save for a few IRL spectators.) But I doubt everyone will care about these headscratchers; the walk itself is gripping (sometimes relatably agonizing, as well) and the actors, as I said, are terrific. I may have said before that Cooper Hoffman has made many of us think positively about the idea of ""nepo babies"", but it bears repeating.",figurative

Its interesting to look up the things they did different vs reality, but its a really cool true story.

"Touched by a demon ""Shelby Oaks"" follows Mia, whose younger sister Riley, a paranormal investigator in the early days of YouTube, disappeared in the titular abandoned midwestern town of Shelby Oaks, Ohio. Twelve years later, a disturbing incident reignites Mia's investigation into her sister's disappearance, leading her down a rabbit hole to a disturbing truth from the siblings' past.

I am only vaguely familiar with Chris Stuckmann's lengthy YouTube career as a film reviewer, so I feel I went into this with little bias in or out of his favor. The premise of ""Shelby Oaks"" is intriguing, and has some solid working elements at play. It begins with a found footage/documentary style mashup introduction to Riley and her group of fellow paranormal investigators, riffing on the mid-late 2000s wild west of the YouTube platform before shifting gears into a traditional narrative format. The found footage element recurs throughout to help unfurl the narrative, and while some have critiqued the film for this shift, I actually think it works fairly well and is the least of the film's problems.

The general format here plays on nostalgia for both millennials who came of age during this era, and for younger generations who have an innate curiosity for a time in internet culture that they were too young (or not even alive) to have bore witness to. There are obvious nods here to ""The Blair Witch Project"" and ""Lake Mungo"", and those are only a sliver of filmic references that Stuckmann touches on throughout the film. At times, it even reminded me of lesser-known films like ""The Collingswood Story"" in terms of tone.

Atmospherically, all of the references and touchstones are well-orchestrated elements of ""Shelby Oaks."" Derivative? Sure. But derivative can still be done well, and on a visual and atmospheric level, the film is successful. Where it suffers is its rote, scattershot reliance on tropes and uneven pacing, which renders the entire piece often feeling pointlessly stitched together as the story progresses. A derelict prison? Check. A haunted amusement park? Check. A rotting backwoods cabin? Check. As an audience, we tour each of these spooky locales with Mia searching for breadcrumbs, but each visitation feels unfortunately disconnected and arbitrary.

Camille Sullivan gives it her all here as Mia and is convincing, while Sarah Durn's mostly camcorder-captured performance as Riley is ethereal and sufficiently haunting, but the pretext of the siblings' relationship is lacking. The result is a rote and more often than not clumsy ""down the rabbit hole"" sequence of events as Mia follows clue after clue; the problem is that, though each clue appears to point to a darker truth at the narrative's core, there is no strong sense of danger or dread. It feels very much like a rinse-and-repeat job until the revelation is unveiled, which is a shame because the finale is actually rather surprising and went in a direction I did not anticipate-it's just that the ride there (at least from the midsection onward) feels clunky and is not nearly as compelling as it could have been.

Ultimately, this is a flawed film, though I don't feel that its weaknesses fully discount it. It seems that audiences are divided on which elements work better, with some favoring the found footage segments, while others feel the traditional narrative section that makes up the bulk of the last three quarters is superior. I feel the former is much stronger, but it's not necessarily because of the found footage format itself-rather, it's simply that these moments tend to strike an ominous chord that much of the rest of the film does not. By the end of it all, the payoff is not entirely satisfying because the journey there is ultimately too mechanical. Despite this, though, I do think there are enough strong moments here to warrant a viewing of ""Shelby Oaks."" That being said, I would note that it is a film that is fundamentally not a sum of its parts. 6/10.",figurative

I've been annoyed by at least one character per season, I've suffered or rejoiced with another. I have to leave out Frank. I didn't like him from the start. From around season 5 onwards, however, I found it much harder to sympathize with the Gallaghers at all.

Although I don't blame the characters alone for that. It was more the storylines that led me to this. As if everyday life wasn't exciting enough for the Gallaghers, churches had to be founded and helicopters had to be stolen.

I only kept watching because I wanted to know whether Ian and Mickey would get a happy ending at some point and that should have been the end of the series. Because the final season was the worst concoction that you couldn't have dreamed up.

No plot holes were unearthed, there was no sign of Fiona, but instead life during a pandemic and everything was rushed through towards a new beginning. Pointless. Why would EVERYONE suddenly get their lives together at the same time when they haven't been able to for the last 10 years?",figurative
"Someone is lying This review protected by first amendment .

Someone is lying about this event .

I work at Toys R Us from 1993 to 1998 I clearly remember . My boss name Jim Grey called me to the back room of our store . He want me to volunteer to check our store roof thought of someone living on it . I laughed and said , no one is living on our roof .

My boss got angry at me . I said fine . I will pick a team to go on the roof with me . It did it sometime in the morning or in the afternoon . I remember walking our store whole roof with my team . We found no one . I said , see I was right . After we all got off the roof . Jim Gery change lock with a huge lock . Saying he not trusting anyone and this lock stay.

"Such a pleasant surprise. When I saw there was a sequel I was a bit surprised, and the trailer interested me but didn't really set me aflame. Boy am I glad I went to see this in theaters, I think I liked it better than the first. It was definitely scarier, and it really builds on the emotional core of the first movie, you already care about these characters because of the excellent work done in Black Phone, so it makes the stakes really high in this sequel. This is a very different movie from the first, and I love that, it has a lot in common with A Nightmare on Elm Street or The Conjuring, and I was here for it. It really ups the supernatural elements of the first film and is much more intense. It's not all scares, just like the first movie it focuses on the drama and trauma of this family and the acting is amazing from everyone. The Grabber is really scary, and Ethan Hawke gives another great performance as this character. I was totally drawn into this movie, it surprised me, scared me, and moved me. If you're on the fence like I was, I would encourage you to go see it, I think it's one of my favorites of the year.",literal
"Amazing movie Really good animation style. Great new original story, you haven't seen before. Favorite movie of the year! The fight scenes are so different from the usual movies. But kinda like arcane and spiderman (the animated). Just a really good girly pop movie. 10/10 recommended. It has so many emotional elements, love, power, shame and sadness. It's a confidence boost of a movie. The soundtracks are so catchy, people have been singing it for weeks before It even came out. The multiple of soundtracks gave me chills, and makes you wanna get up and move your body. It's so good my bf even liked it, even though it's targeted mostly for women. It's just that good.",literal
"I have absolutely no idea why... ...I like this show but I do.. The characters are absurd and the stories beyond the creativity of us sane folk. Jenna Ortega of whom I had never before heard or seen is a hoot. A beautiful young woman with eyes that offer a hint at every thought. Badass women of any age (definition: sarcastic, uncaring, dark, morbid and aggressive - - but not dangerous or hateful) get my attention. I share this morbidity and sarcasm and laugh at my own such comments no one else sees as funny. Having confessed the most alluring (to me) about this show is her observations and comments I would write much more of the same into her lines.

I am 76 and imagine some portion of all ages will find something fun in this series. Fun show. Wide variety of characters. The good ratings may result from the creativity of the stories and variety of characters.

An aside: I am not at all a fan of any Hollywood billionaire and gravitate to series that use new, high quality but lower-paid talent. Catherine Zeta-Jones is a big name. The other talent is lesser known...cost containment!",figurative

I don't understand the character of Watson neither, the acting, the accent that works only for some words is confusing but so is the screen writing. The story doesn't make sens. There is no sugeron in the hospital because the bridge is closed :/ seriously ?

Also there is no chemistry even with the ex wife... I didn't appreciate the writing, the acting and every character is so Boring. Sorry don't want to hurt any actors feelings but it's also their duty to tell the director that this is too boring to work.",literal
"Started out so good....then got preachy I am a little way into season 3 of ""The Rookie."" Today I clicked over to IMDb, wondering whether other people also started out really enjoying the series then became frustrated by the increasing preachy-ness. Yep.

The show had so much going for it. Engaging characters, great action, just the right amount of humor, interesting and often unpredictable plots (both within an episode and multi-episode story arcs)...All that in addition to wrestling with complex issues faced by cops and society as a whole. That's great. That aspect gives the show heart and makes it more interesting.

But then season 3 came. The writers got lazy, handing us lame dialogue, cardboard characters, and woke ideology served straight up. Remember, Rookie team, that most people watch a TV show to be entertained. If I want moralizing and preaching, I'll go to church or watch a Greta Thunberg clip.

Please, get back to the season 1 vibe!",literal
"All in all, a sweet, gentle, kind, sentimental and congenial wrap. Exactly what fans would expect. After watching the finale I have so many emotions. This is how you end a show.

The Big Bang Theory ends with a bang.",literal

"Not as good as people say I mean come on. The soundtracks is lame, with the sole exception being the song How Far I'll Go. That one is so catchy. Other than that it's nothing special. Moana is one of the rare if not the only Disney princess without a love interest. That's cool, but I suspect it has something to do with Maui being less than attractive. If he looked better, I'm sure they would've been a couple.

Hei Hei is the dumbest animal sidekick ever. There's no point in his character.

I found Moana's granny's personality to be more appealing than that of Moana herself. She's ok, just loud and whiny.

Story itself is nothing special. That would be my take on this one.",literal

"So Cool And refreshing, funny and so worth watching.

Unlike the currently prevailing formula for this type of series, there's real grit behind the characters and an abundance of humour, notably in Series 3.

This one smells like London.

All of the people involved are very effective actors who interact impeccably.

Gary Oldman portrays his rather unique character brilliantly with many throwaway lines, some of which really deserve immortality - or a dedicated webiste.

The other Slow Horses are a very mixed bunch of rejects and vary in effectiveness but mainly all more than earn their keep.

Chrisoppher Chung in particular provides an interesting counterpoint to his comrades.

Mick Jagger's theme tune works.

Really hoping that Season 4 will not be too much influenced by Hollywood.

This is top of my watch list every time for all of those reasons.",literal

"I can't believe people enjoyed this I could feel the low-quality nature of this movie immediately. I'm surprised it got a wide theatrical release. It does not feel cinematic. And there's something generally off about everything.

I like Aziz Ansari, I've always found him funny. But this seems to be his first role as a movie director and writer. And it shows. To make it worse, I found him completely unfunny in this role, most likely due to his poor directing and writing.

I barely laughed. I found the story cliche and predictable. The subject matter is depressing and not what you want when choosing to watch a comedy movie. And the life lessons are useless.

I had a terrible time with this movie, rolled my eyes so many times, and couldn't wait for it to be over.

"But why!! Imagine taking Arnold Schwarzenegger in Commando plus Terminator, combined with Sylvester Stallone in Rambo, and they than combined with all the Spartans from 300 and you get this over the top, unbelievable character who can put Thor to shame in a battle. He is also Captain America, where he fights a whole bunch of Nazis while every conceivable weapon is been fired at him , but all he has to do is hold a shield up and wow he is saved. Also he jumps on plane using a pick axe and survives a plane crash, a serious plane crash because he straps his seat belts, and by the way that whole crashed plane goes inside a marsh and he comes out walking. Man, this guy can give Superman a run for money and guess what, he is not vulnerable to Krytonite.

If this was promoted as a superhero / fantasy genre, I would have shut off my logical thinking and would have tried to enjoy it. But this was a supposed to a second world based , survival of a tough protagonist story.

The cinematography is beautiful but even that fails to make this badly written, over acted and absolutely pathetic story line bearable.

I have no idea what the script writers or director was trying to do. This is just a bunch of absolute nonsense out together in form of a story,

If this was an attempt to glorify the Finnish forces during the Second World War, they have failed badly. I am sure there were a thousand of story that showcase their bravery and they could have been showcased instead of this pathetic piece of joke.",literal
"Checks out, but with some missteps Moana is a (thankfully) non-Americanized cultural piece surrounding islander mythos, very reminiscent of old Disney, capitalizing on their phenomenal animation and with an unforgettable musical piece; ""You're welcome"" is perhaps one of the best songs I've seen in these, which is amazing considering it was sang by an A-list celebrity and not an actual artist, and in a child's movie no less.

The idea of an animated tattoo, and a hubris-filled demigod that seeks to appease the people but who's own ego impedes story progression and conflicts with Moana is actually great, however it was brief and without a moving character ark: Maui is an under-exploited plot device throughout the film, and the main character Moana fails to bring more than superficial charm as her character, even if it was done with class. Simply put, Moana is not intrinsically interesting, and the character is moved along largely by a variety of convenient occurrences.

Despite attempts made at worldbuilding and storytelling, it lacks depth and thus can't fully achieve excellence, and this is countered in tandem by plot holes, plot armor, and incomplete character development.

That all being said, it is visually stunning, entertaining, and as said prior, captivating in its musical pieces and premise.",literal
"Glacial pacing and boring This had potential but the pacing kills it right off the bat. They talk and talk and talk and nothing happens. And then they repeat the talking and plot points ad nauseum.

Whole episodes go by and nothing happens.

The characters are annoying and unlikable. And what's with the CGI faces of these old actors?

Kristine Whig seems to be in every scene. There's no relief from her. The acting in general is lousy, and the entire whale scene is stupid and disgusting.

The women are a bunch of parasites and we're supposed to find them amusing? And what's with the group of frumps in the book store?

Total waste of time.",figurative
Enjoying the heck out of this show! It's great to see Kevin Costner in this series. I applaud Taylor Sheridan for such a fine job and of course Costner too.

I highly recommend watching the series just warning you about the daughter.,literal
"I tried to like this I really wanted to like this. The premise is good and I was excited to see one of my favorites, Morena Baccarin, in the lead role.

The actors overall are fine but I can feel the unease they seem to have with the scripts they've been given.",literal
"Awful story logic; self-indulgent First a note on story logic for those who have not studied narrative: If a storyteller starts a ghost story with clues about a vengeful ghost tormenting the heirs of a family, it breaks story logic to have the ghost appear and immediately make and eat a sandwich, bump into a wall, and walk to the grocery store and torment random shoppers.

That would be an agreement with the audience that this is sketch comedy or nonsense logic about the ghost that wasn't a ghost (for whatever you can do with that). Otherwise you owe it to your audience in short order to explain why your narrative's rules for this ghost are totally different from both your own set up and our common conceptions of a ghost in a ghost story.

Pluribus sets itself up as science fiction with radio telescopes, a message from space about a RNA sequence for a virus, and top-end virus labs experimenting with that RNA sequence, and then switches to magic with a 'virus' that within seconds changes people's biology and psychology from a kiss.

No. That is incoherent.

You may not leave this mystery box for season 2. You are at minimum obliged to give some kind of science fantasy explanation for this magic 'virus'.

Setting up a mystery box like this lets the writers boil the plot without any need for any kind of internal logic. If the magic virus had come from a purple unicorn that only appears once every thousand years, it'd make more sense than Pluribus' set up.

Equally aggravating, the two long scenes of the main character's book signing takes many minutes with lots of little bits to add very little to the portrait of the main character. I'm not arguing screenwriting 101 here, but if a show is going to have a scene that loose and rambling in terms of plot and character set up, those bits had better be golden both for entertainment and for establishing a tone for the world.

I will never know if those scenes were useful for establishing tone because I have no more interest in the show after the first half of the first episode. The show deserves no more of a chance after that awful story logic and self-indulgence.

Modern American television is such a content mill or vat to pump content from that 'rule of cool' beats coherence even from established showrunners such as Gilligan. It's a disgrace that TV critics didn't have the brains to see how much of a failure episode one is, or didn't have the guts to call it out. I find the high reviews by critics and users to be suspicious.

"What a refreshing change from all the others NCIS is a skillful balance of humor and serious drama. None of the major characters is static, i.e. there is depth. Every week, we discover more about the characters, who they are, where they are coming from, why they do what they do. But the show does not sacrifice the plot for the sake of the characters. Stories are well thought-out and believable. The cast is superb, with Mark Harman leading the ensemble. What a complex character, that Leroy Jethro Gibbs! At first, I did not like Tony; I thought he was an ego-centric, male chauvinist pig, but there's more in there than the id-controlled Mr. DiNozzo, I'm discovering. Then there's Abby--I just adore Abby! The mix of scientist, alternative lifestyle, street smarts and just a touch of naiveté. Tim McGee started out like a puppy, willing to please. Well, that puppy's growing up, folks, and watch out! The two new characters, Ziva & Jenn are intriguing as well. I love the sexual tension between the director and Gibbs. And Ziva is more than a match for Tony. The vulnerability we saw in Hiatus was great, too. And Ducky: I save him for last for many reasons. A David McCallum fan for more years than I care to numerate, I can easily say that this is probably his best role (Colditz was his second best--check it out if you can).

All in all, I look forward to the 4th season to show the same excellence of craft as the last three have accomplished.",literal

"accomplishes what it sets out to do XXX is a true rarity in cinema, a sequel that outdoes it's original. XXX (clearly the Fast and the Furious 2) has overdone action sequences, while exciting and fun, are ridiculous and unrealistic.

"Recommended Well, what can I say?

Black Rabbit is one of those rare limited series that grips you from the very first scene and refuses to let go. The writing is razor sharp, the pacing is meticulous and the performances are nothing short of magnetic. Jude Law and Jason Bateman bring a gritty depth to their roles, creating a world that feels raw, lived-in and morally complex.

One of the standout touches is the episode introductions, which cleverly pay homage to Ozark. Each episode opens with a sleek, symbolic graphic that foreshadows the themes and events about to unfold. It's subtle yet striking and it adds an extra layer of anticipation before the story even kicks in. For viewers who appreciated Ozark's visual storytelling, this will feel like a respectful nod while still carving out its own identity.

The cinematography leans heavily into shadows and muted palettes, enhancing the tension without ever feeling forced. Meanwhile, the soundtrack complements the mood perfectly, weaving in and out without overshadowing the drama.

Overall, Black Rabbit is dark, deliberate and deeply compelling. It's not just another thriller - it's prestige television done right, with every detail (down to the graphics at the start of each episode) contributing to the atmosphere. If you loved Ozark but want something fresh with its own unique flavour, this is a must-watch.

If you're a film junkie like myself then you'll appreciate the time and effort that Zach Baylin and everyone else put in to make this happen.

I enjoyed it. Not my place to say where it could have been improved. It is what it is.

Thank you.",literal
"Welcome to a GOOD King adaptation I first read 'It' in 1999. I was 9 years old. I should NOT have been reading ANY Stephen King at that age - but especially that book. It definitely made an impression on my young mind and has never really left me. I've reread it half a dozen times throughout my life and find myself coming back to it every once in a while. Now, as a book fan and aa bigger Stephen King fan (Tower junkie here) Ive more often than not been disappointed with King adaptations over the years. IT 2016 (both parts) were, for me, a bit of a let down. I thought they missed a lot of what made the book (along with the town of Derry and Stephen King in general) interesting and scary. I wasnt very thrilled with the idea of 'Welcome to Derry' but figured I'd check it out - wasnt I surprised to find that while it isn't the book - like the 2016 movie isn't- it incorporates so much more of the feelings, themes, and ideas in King's book and other writings. It forges so many more connections with the book and the wider King universe than the 2016 movie but also stats true to that film. The first 3 episodes have all been really solid and Ive been surprised with how good its been. There are a few things theyve done that have made certain grievances I had with the 2016 film(s) lessen or go away completely.

I recommend the show for non fans and fans alike. Stephen King fans will find a lot here and won't be disappointed (at least yet).",literal

This dude is annoying to say the least. How people like him, or even think he's funny is beyond me!

Sorry not sorry.",literal
"Overrated I have no idea how the rating is so high. I'm guessing it's only from people who read the book and were excited about the adaptation. The acting is on the level of a basic lifetime movie. The script is cheesy at best. The premise of the story is great, but with way too much filler that has absolutely no bearing on the story, it takes away from the potential. I only watched all of it because the reviews promised twist after twist. Each ""twist"" was just adding another random stranger into the story that we'd never seen before, so there was no way of guessing that it would have happened. I didn't guess the actual final reason why everything actually happened to set the events into motion, but I was pretty much spot on with everything else, just guessing ""oh, it's because that guy did this""... It was all pretty obvious. If this had been just a movie, without all the extra wasted side stories (and a little better acting), I probably would have enjoyed it a bit more.",figurative
"Caper film that is a little too dependent on surprises Now You See Me is a film that is all about obfuscation. Focusing on four magicians that perform feats of wonder first separately and later together, from the first frame on, the film engages in cinematic sleight of hand. However, that formula backfires on the film: by constantly trying to engage in trickery, the audience finds itself always on the lookout for it, and by the time it starts winding down, most of the potential surprises are rendered moot by the fact that we were looking for and expecting said surprises. Thus, while Now You See Me is fun and engaging at times, as a twist-filled surprise machine, it falls flat on it's face.

As the film opens, we are introduced to four illusionists: fast talking street-level card sharp Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), ""mentalist"" and small-time con man Merrit McKinney (Woody Harrelson), spoon-bending junior magician Jack Wilder (Dave Franco) and show-stopping high-thrills Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher). All of them are given a special card with an address and time on it, and when they all show up at the prescribed time and place, a small apartment in New York, they discover what appears to be a quite elaborate set of plans. Flash forward one year later, and the four magicians are performing as a single act under the moniker The Four Horsemen and are being bankrolled by millionaire Arthur Tressler (Michael Caine) During their debut performance in Las Vegas, they close their act with a rather spectacular accomplishment: they transport a French audience member to his bank in France and proceed to steal several billion dollars from it and magically transport it back to the Las Vegas auditorium where they pour it onto the audience.

Unsurprisingly, this gets the attention of the FBI, and agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) is assigned to the case. He teams up with Interpol agent Alma Dray (Melanie Laurent) and interrogates the Four Horsemen, but with nothing to pin on them, is forced to let them walk. Rhodes seeks the counsel of former magician Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman) who now spends his time debunking magicians, revealing what is ""behind the curtain"". With Bradley's help, Rhodes is able to unravel what happened at the first performance, but the Four Horsemen are already moving on to New Orleans for their next show and Rhodes and Dray are trying to stay one step ahead of them.

Now You See Me is a film that is intended to keep us on our toes, to leave the audience guessing and wondering what the next revelation is going to be. Sometimes these kind of films can work well, engaging in misdirection and providing red herrings and dead ends for us to believe in before showing us what is really going on. Where Now You See Me missteps is that, from very early in the proceedings, the film telegraphs its intentions so loudly that most of the enjoyment of being caught up in twists is lost. That the twists are such a central part of the film is obvious from the start and makes them less engaging than if they evolved more naturally out of the narrative. Now You See Me is designed and built almost exclusively to keep us guessing but by focusing almost exclusively on that, it overreaches.

Now You See Me isn't helped by the fact that the main characters are, save for some quickly introduced character moments and a few exchanges of witty dialogue, almost completely ciphers. Atlas, McKinnney, Wilder and Reeves are barely developed at all, and frankly, excepting for the moments they are performing their stage acts, are not even afforded that much screen time. The screenplay does play a bit with the intentions of the characters, but it is obvious that we are supposed to be rooting for them at times, and it makes it difficult to work up much enthusiasm for them when we barely know them. More screen time is afforded to Rhodes and Dray, and the two develop a romantic chemistry that is palpable at times, but, much like the other characters, they are largely pawns of the screenplay, but they are at least given more to work with than the magicians.

Director Louis Leterrier films Now You See Me in Michael Bay mode: the camera rarely stops moving for more than a few seconds. During the magic acts, especially the first one in Vegas, this does bring a degree of style to the proceedings but at times the over reliance on an endlessly moving camera can prove distracting. However, Leterrier does keep the pace brisk and the energy level high. Now You See Me certainly can't be called boring.

If Now You See Me succeeds anywhere, it is in the casting. Leterrier has pulled together a strong set of performers and, especially regarding the Four Horsemen, what is sometimes lacking in the screenplay is made up for by likable actors. Eisenberg makes Atlas a fast talking smart alec with a nice streak of charisma, Harrelson gives some fun wisecracks and Fisher is, once again, a strong sensual presence with a degree of toughness. Morgan Freeman can't help but class up anything he appears in and his turn here is no different, his Bradley is nice mix of arrogance and charm. Ruffalo is also at his dependable best, a man fighting to stay with his fugitives while barely managing to stay on top of their capers. 

It may sound like I am down on Now You See Me, but that isn't completely true. By the time the film was over, I found myself pleasantly engaged and entertained at times, but so much is wrapped up in the film's obvious Rube Goldberg plotting that you can't but help feel disappointed when the film doesn't really deviate from where you expect. Now You See Me is like sneaking a peek at your Christmas gifts: knowing what is coming isn't as much fun as not knowing.",figurative
"Great Series I have just recently been able to binge watch this series, and I was hooked after the first episode! One thing that I noticed is how the Dutton Ranch cowboys were always degrading the tourist because they (the tourist) did not know everything that the ranch hands knew, however when they moved the cattle to Texas they became to clueless tourist and had no clue how to ""cowboy"" in Texas. The amount of hypocrisy in them was completely obvious. Make you wonder how much of that goes on in the real world. I am looking forward to any spin off series and how the characters develop. Keep up the good work!!!",literal

"My Number One show It's funny. I have been watching the show since its inception, and consider it the best show on TV today, and yet I have rarely written about it. It is true the show's golden era (Orbach, Bratt, Waterston, Hennessey) has long passed, but the show somehow keeps moving forward, even with some bad choices in both permanent roles and guest spots. Of course, some of those permanent spots turned out to be far from permanent. The new season starts in a few days, and additional cast changes are in store. We shall see what we shall see. But it remains that no other show on television, including the many L&O spinoffs, comes close to touching the original LAW AND ORDER for originality, acting, scripting, direction and production values. I can only assume that show originator Dick Wolf is keeping an active hand in things. Having just watched large portions of an L&O New Year's marathon on TNT, I was struck by how much the show has developed but also that the show has had it ""right"" from the very beginning. It has rarely faltered.",literal
"Worth the watch Malice hooked me fast. The whole vibe gives YOU energy - that slick, intimate tension where you're low-key rooting for people you definitely shouldn't be. It's stylish without trying too hard, and the atmosphere keeps you in that ""one more episode"" loop instantly.

The acting is honestly the standout. Everyone brings this eerie, magnetic energy that carries even the slower moments. You feel every stare, every awkward silence, every shady decision. They really understood the assignment.

But the ending? Yeah... it didn't hit. After all that build-up, it felt rushed and weirdly flat, like the writers suddenly ran out of runway. Not a dealbreaker, just frustrating because the rest of the show is so strong.

Still, if you're into psychological thrillers with YOU-style tension and great performances, Malice is 100% worth the watch.",literal
"Started out great This started out great and Nathan Fillion is always pretty great. However, the realism is awful even by Hollywood standards. I watched 2 seasons and it was really laughable how every single episode had the rookies be involved in massive shooutouts and huge cases. Also, every bad guy has an automatic weapon and never hits anything or anyone.

Then there's the normal Hollywood craziness with bullet proof car doors etc. And the fact that your every day patrol officers do the things that in real life specialized units and SWAT would handle.

Great idea, but the execution is lacking. What started out as a pretty unique show quickly turned into yet another regular cop show.",literal
"Disappointed Dystopian alternate world of happiness. I really had hope with the first few minutes of this show. Liked the connection to communication from other worlds, like Contact, the Carl Sagan story. Then it morphed into Stepford Wives. RNA virus? Ugh. Don't give folks that idea. Just too soon. Oh well, perhaps even a heavy hitter like Vince Gilligan can't get a decent story greenlit. Everything has to be whacked out, dystopian, zombies, super violent (read here: Taylor Sheridan) or super hero. Please Apple +, fund regular stories about real people. Anyway, Seehorn was great. She's an amazing actress. Maybe the remaining 7 episodes will get better.",literal
"National Lampoon: Christmas Vacation will give you the hap-hap-happies Christmas ever! Great watch! Where do you think you're going? Nobody's leaving. Nobody's walking out on this fun, old-fashioned family Christmas. No, no. We're all in this together. This is a full-blown, four-alarm holiday emergency here. We're gonna press on, and we're gonna have the hap, hap, happiest Christmas since Bing Crosby tap-danced with Danny f*cking Kaye. And when Santa squeezes his fat white ass down that chimney tonight, he's gonna find the jolliest bunch of assholes this side of the nuthouse. We're going to have the hap-hap-happiest Christmas ever! It's that time of year again! You can't celebrate Christmas without watching National Lampoon Christmas Vacation, first! Directed by Jeremiah S. Chechik. It is the third installment in National Lampoon's Vacation film series, and was written by John Hughes, based on his short story in National Lampoon magazine, ""Christmas '59"". This movie is notable for being the only one of the Vacation series to take place at the Griswold home which gives the vacation concept, something new. Some people think as this movie as a reboot than a sequel. The film tells the story of Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) whom is trying to create the best Christmas for his family, but everything, he wants to happen, go against his favor. Can Clark Griswold make the best Christmas holiday for his family or will it turn out to be another disaster? Watch it, to find out. Without spoiling the film, too much. The movie is a great watch. Most of the humors hit the funny bone than miss to me. I love the animated opening credits with the Christmas vacation theme. Apparently even Santa Claus isn't immune to the comic misfortune. I love the slapstick humor has for Clark. Clark trying to set up Christmas lightings is probably the highlight of the film. The movie was very smart in its recycle on old jokes like the Easter eggs, Wally World Cups. Still, other old clichés felt a little overused by other films at the time such as the dog humping scene. Even, Mele Kalikimaka pool sequence was kinda overused. It remind me, of the pool sequence from 1982's Fast Time at Ridgemont High. It wasn't really funny. The fan service, Mary's (Nicolette Scorsese) scenes are hot, but it could be taken out, in my opinion as it has nothing to bring to the table. She's no Christie Brinkley. Some people might not like the dark crude raunchy humor, the movie brings. After all, it does have a cat getting killed on screen and an elderly man getting catch on fire. This movie might not be for everybody. If you got small children, this movie might not be for them with all the sex, violence and harsh language themes. A parent should judge for themselves, if this movie is alright for their children. For the most part, it felt like a PG-13. The movie is well acted. The original cast is just as good as they were in the original previous movie. Chevy Chase is awesome as the everyman father, who just wanted to give the best Christmas ever to his family, but has to fight so much to do it. In my opinion, this is Chevy Chase's greatest film. Supporting characters like Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo), were alright for the most part, despite her, being the submissive of sorts, type of wife. The children, Aubrey (Juliette Lewis) and Rusty (Johnny Galecki) were kinda forgettable as they are given little to no screen time. It's seem like in every Vacation movie, new actors are always playing the Griswold's children. It can be a bit confusing as Rusty and Audrey's age differ from film to film. In this film, Audrey tends to be older, despite Rusty being older in the previous two films. Anyways, the previous Griswold's children actors really didn't do much, after their film. At less, these actors went on to become bigger names in the industry. One of the most entertaining part of the film, had to come with Randy Quaid's character of Cousin Eddie who comes back from the original film to plays the opposite of Chevy Chase's straight man character as the scene-stealing slob. He wasn't too annoying or unlikeable. Quaid did the right amount of balance. Other people worth noting is Julia Louis-Dreyfus as the yippie neighbor, Margo Chester, whom always get accident abuse from the Griswold. She was funny. The movie has way too much elder characters to remember. Those could be cut down, or written better. The only ones, I can remember are Francis (Doris Roberts), Bethany (Mae Questel), Lewis (William Hickey) and Art (E.G. Marshall). All of them add their own bits of amusement. Overall: Having seen the previous two films in the Lampoon series. 1983's National Lampoon's Vacation & 1985's National Lampoon's European Vacation. I was delighted, this film was really enjoyable. In my opinion, it's the best comedy in the National Lampoon series as a whole. It was not a disappointment, like the sequel, 2003's Christmas Vacation 2: Cousin Eddie's Island Adventure & 1997's National Lampoon's Vegas Vacation. Since its release in 1989, Christmas Vacation has often been labeled as a modern Christmas classic. This film should definitely raise your spirits and give thanks that your Christmas isn't as stressful as the Griswold.",figurative
"Every day of the week should be like Wednesday Let me prephase this by saying I loved the Addams Family movies. The 90's versions were my favorite and Wednesday was among the top reasons, if not the very top.

Now with that out of the way this series is just amazing. Everything from the plot, to the atmosphere to the repartee is extraordinary! My only issue is the casting of Gomez and it's got nothing to do with anything that the current actor did, it's just... Everyone's a step down from Raul Julia. I'm sorry but when you've seen the best, it's kind of hard to stomach anyone else in that role. Having said that the rest of the cast did a great job especially Wednesday herself. Whoever decided to cast Jenna Ortega is a genius. I can't think of anyone more perfect for that part and she delivers perfectly.

10/10 this is how you revive a show the proper way.",literal
"Total fun! WEIRD SCIENCE was a great movie made in the mid 80s.The cast is pretty cool,it is fairly well acted,and its total fun! The film develops nicely from beginning nearly till the end,the last 15 minutes of the film are rather unnecessary.Although not the best 80s film out,it is a great imaginary film,with pretty cool SFX. Bill Paxton did an exceptionally well performance,i had total fun watching this movie,you will too!

Isn't fun to watch anymore Showtime extended Shameless beyond natural endpoints and now (season 10) the show is going on without much purpose. They promoted Debbie to the female lead and she was slowly but surely morphing into Fiona. Most of the storylines have been done before & now Shameless is just a shell of its former self.,literal
"One can only appreciate... Leroy Jethro Gibbs, if you have followed his story from the original NCIS. These episodes help fill in SO many gaps and clue you into the complex nature of the legendary Gibbs! Not only do you get insight into how he has grown into the special agent he is, but you get to see how Mike Franks played a role in Gibbs' early days. Gibbs' and Franks' interaction and relationship was one of my favorites in NCIS, so I am greatly enjoying seeing their complex friendship/mentorship unfold in NCIS:Origins.

Thus far, episode 10 has been my favorite! I am counting down the days until the rest of season 1 is released! I really hope this series continues! I AM HOOKED!",literal

Otherwise you may end up rating it down by more than just one and are overcome by disappointment...",literal
"Spared no expense Greetings again from the darkness. It's been 32 years since John Hammond ""spared no expense"" on ice cream and Chaos Theory Doctor Malcolm pleaded that the colorful jeep ""must go faster"". That 1993 film by Steven Spielberg awed us and changed the course of cinema. Now director Gareth Edwards (ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY, 2016; GODZILLA, 2014) brings us the seventh film in the 'Jurassic' franchise. Having adapted Michael Crichton's books for the first two in the series, renowned screenwriter David Koepp (who has also contributed to Mission: Impossible, Indiana Jones, and Spider-Man franchises, among others) returns for ""Rebirth"".

Opening with a flashback to fifteen years prior, we see the InGen lab where experimental cross-breeding has resulted in dino-mutations, and we are only about four minutes in when we get the first dino snack (an unfortunate lab worker). Returning to modern day times (five years after the end of JURASSIC WORLD: DOMINION), we find a citizenry somehow bored with the dinosaurs that have been released into the wild - most of which have died or are dying due to environmental issues caused by us despicable humans. The exception is a remote island near the equator where the climate most resembles prehistoric times, and the beasts are free to roam ... as it's now a ""No people allowed"" sanctuary. It's also a former InGen lab site.

This all sets the stage for greedy Big Pharma executive, Martin Krebs (Rupert Friend) to plan an excursion with the goal of collecting DNA from the three largest dino species from land, sea, and air. Oh, and minor detail - the DNA has to be collected from live specimens. The DNA can supposedly be used for major medical breakthroughs. Krebs hires Zora Bennett (Scarlett Johansson), a mercenary for ""situational security and reaction"", and Dr Henry Loomis (Jonathan Bailey, WICKED, 2024) a paleontologist trained by the infamous Dr Grant. Zora assembles the rest of the team, including friend and boat captain Duncan Kincaid (Oscar winner Mahershala Ali), and the rest of his crew.

Separately, a family sailing the same waters is introduced. Reuben (Manuel Garcia-Rulfo) and his two daughters, college-aged Teresa (Luna Blaise) and clever 11-year-old Isabella (Audrina Miranda), along with Teresa's lazy and spacey boyfriend Xavier (David Iacono).

This secondary group provides us with 'normal' folks to fear for as their boat is dino-attacked, leaving them stranded in the sea, awaiting recovery by the pharma boat. This creates a strange mixture of folks and, most importantly, allows for the mandatory kid-in-peril. Another dino-attack on the boat separates the family from the team and begins the process of scratching characters from the story.

The adventures are quite different for the two groups, and the island scenery is consistently awe-inspiring. But we are all here for dinosaurs, and on that front, the film never disappoints. Very few gaps occur between sightings or attacks, and the dinosaurs dazzle. A slumbering by the river T-Rex provides one of the best chase/attack scenes from any of the Jurassic movies (with a tip of the raft to the Crichton novel). Of course, we know who the villain will be, and we know how things go for villains in these movies. The story includes an altruistic approach from Loomis, who flashes some survival instincts despite a career spent in an air-conditioned museum, rather than a dino-filled jungle.

We are left to ponder what the titular ""Rebirth"" refers to. The film doesn't offer anything new, outside of the mutants ... including the much-anticipated D-Rex (sporting the head of a Beluga whale?). Your individual level of critique will determine whether you buy Scarlett Johansson as the ultimate tough warrior, although John Mathieson's stunning cinematography and composer Alexandre Desplat's score (generously sprinkled with John Williams' iconic JP score) are complementary to an overall entertaining and crowd-pleasing big-budget summer blockbuster, with many nods to the previous films in the franchise. Race cars and dinosaurs in the same summer ... spared no expense.

"Good showing season 1 and 2, 3 missing the mark Seasons 1 and 2 are worth the watch, but season 3 has really dropped the ball here.

It's clear the show-runners have decided Season 3 will focus on educating viewers of political talking points, which would be fine if it was subtle about it and if it didn't detract from the show we know from seasons 1 and 2.

Unfortunately it fails both of those tests.

Episode 3 update: Same deal. It's like I'm watching clips from /r/AmIFreeToGo but it's a TV show.",literal
"Comforting Fall Vibes I really enjoyed the earlier seasons of the show and I though the characters were really likable and relatable but not so much in the later seasons.

I really enjoy Rory's relationships and my favorite seasons were when she was in high school.",literal
"Blown away - Like Saitama the anime itself has no limit's to its awesomeness! I am truly tempted to give One punch man a 10 but in my opinion there is no perfection. There is near perfection and one punch man is that. 

The first episode that i saw, i laughed so hard that i almost fell off my chair. As it progresses to the next episodes they try to combine the comedic and the seriousness of the story together, and they manage to do that. I feel like that the writers are truly doing this with a feeling of passion and next to it they enjoy the absurd fighting sequences. 

Opinion on the last two episodes of season 1:

My thoughts: The amount of awesomeness put in this two episodes is beyond imagination. It's just incredible how they build up the climax to the end and to show the endless powers Saitama has. Although it's a parody it doesn't stop me as a viewer to enjoy the anime and accept it as part of something great. When i say something great, i mean putting it next dragon ball, and other incredible animes. It's obvious to the rational thinker that a lot of elements like the characters design (boros etc) are similar to Dragon ball, and that it's influenced by them. 

BUT what makes it so different one might ask himself: Just by observing the amount of details put in to the fighting sequences will tell you that 'one punch man' is a serious anime (in some ways). Dragon ball is nostalgic and has a great history and character development behind its series and one punch man will have to gain more years in order to obtain the status DB has. What i'm trying to say is that the detail put in to the fighting scenes in one punch man are far beyond what other anime have achieved or tried to... It's a masterpiece in way... And that's what gave this anime a 9 out of 10. 

He destroys all of his enemies with one punch and mocks them like they were nothing. But it still does not get boring and that's the reason why this anime is a great success. Make the details look sublime and the fighting sequences beyond comprehention, mix it with a flavor of humor/comedy and you've got in my eyes the perfect anime (action fans). Just take a good look at the episode where Saitama fights Genos and you'll get the perfect picture on why this anime is amazing (there are youtube videos with that scene). 

It even got me to search some more info about this anime on the internet. There are youtube videos and articles about the origin of one punch man. It's interesting to take a look. 

I hope this show keeps up the quality as it is and i can't wait for more! ----> after watching the last two episodes i can only imagine where it is headed. This anime has proved (after this season) that it will not fail to entertain it's anime loving fans!",figurative

"The worst movie ever Superman was an absolute disaster and a complete waste of time. For a film about one of the most iconic superheroes ever, it failed on every level. The story was painfully dull, the pacing dragged, and the characters had no depth or life to them. Even the action scenes, which should have been thrilling, felt forced and uninspired. Instead of excitement, the movie delivered nothing but disappointment. Easily one of the worst superhero films I've ever watched.",literal
"Terrible main actress The main actress was the one that drew me to this series- I thought it would be great to see her again and I remember her from the Romeo and Juliet. No it wasn't. I haven't realized her acting skills are that poor, with time 'the trembling chin', the stare and the over the top scared reaction pulled me off. I didn't want to watch any longer because of her, even if the actual plot and the quality of the film were good. Overall the film could have been much better with a different main actress. Sorry to say that but a series like that costs lots of money and it is a pity when a result gets spoiled by one bad acting.",figurative
"A whole bunch of fun! I liked it a lot!

I wasn't expecting much and it was great. I laughed out loud constantly, and it was an awesome brofest, type of movie.

I wish I had a son to watch it with, but I have a daughter, but either way great movie. So happy we have Ritchson for years to come and James is always a laugh riot!. Great fun guys! Kids did great acting too, And Isla...Borat's wife... I would expect nothing less. So much super funny. Honestly people who give it five stars don't really have a sense of humor, lighten up a bit! At least 8.5/10, I really enjoyed it! And when he came out of the elevator, I realized it was on the Vancouver, which is where I live. Even better. Cheers fans and cast!",literal
"National lampoon's first blood Firstly I'll start of by saying that I somewhat enjoyed this film. I like the character, Bob is a great charismatic lead. However...

The director, producer, studio, whoever, did the predictable and remade part 1 but bigger; more bullets, more bombs, more baddies, more fighting, more CGI (groan, more CGI).

It's not a bad film but it's definitely nowhere near the same level as the first, it's not clever and it's not original. It doesn't try.

This iteration also stops playing it straight faced and goes a bit national lampoon's. The action is more cartoonish, the scriptwriting badly let's the side down on numerous occasions. Stone was a poor choice for a very poorly written character and she really hams it up, one of her worst ever performances. Similarly the brother character is made utterly ridiculous, his action scenes are stupid and his monologue during the swordfight is as cringe worthy as the CGI slicing of the pistol with his sword.

Nobody (part 1) was the exception that proves the rule, Hollywood can't make worthwhile films, they cannot stray from a formula, they can't take a risk. That said it's still a vastly better action film than anything Statham has done for Amazon studios.

It's ok for some light entertainment but I hope they call it quits after this effort, I don't think we need another Equaliser series where a movie studio remakes the same film 3 more times.",literal
"Brilliant piece of noir. Love this show! Harjo and Hawke are brilliant together. This is a noir series, so for folks complaining that it's dark, dirty, and gritty, that's the point! The humor is subdued tongue in cheek.

For anyone who is interested in the dark history of Tulsa, there are plenty of easter eggs sprinkled throughout. Harjo has genius vision.",literal
"NOT a rom com. Very disappointing, for sure not what I was expecting. It fell flat with very little plot line. If you watch the trailer you see all the good parts.

Go in knowing it's not a rom com and have no expectations, maybe you'll enjoy it.

Chris is the rom com king and he did the best he could with what he was given.

Pedro's character had good potential but then drastically just got super weird and disappeared.

Dakota is beautiful but more proof yet again she is just too monotone and bland for my liking.

Overall not sure the script was put together well and the execution was just meh.

2 stars for Pedro and Chris, they were pleasant to look at.",literal
"Becoming a social lecture. It started out great in season 1, became a bit over the top in season 2 with rookies being involved in major crimes every day, then season 3 became a social lecture in race relations, gender issues, socio economic concerns, and other touchy feely stuff.

I'm not against having these issues as center pieces in TV shows. Honestly, it's the only way American adults are educated these days, but c'mon. Let them just be cops for an episode or two.",literal
"The Ticking Clock of Conscience A chillingly successful film about an unimaginable, yet terrifyingly realistic nuclear scenario. From the very first moment, this movie grips you relentlessly. There's no time to get acquainted with the characters-the clock is ticking, and that's precisely the point. The true protagonist here is the looming potential of a nuclear missile strike on America and the overwhelming moral dilemmas that accompany it.

The film plunges its audience straight into the deep end, forcing an unflinching contemplation of agonizing questions: Do you remain professionally steadfast, executing your duty, or does your own private life take precedence? Do you absorb the devastating loss of an impact, or do you choose a path of vengeance that can only result in global self-immolation?

Director Kathryn Bigelow has once again delivered a cinematic gem. This isn't a film about political coloring or descending into blind jingoism; it's a stark, compelling examination of morality and existential choices.

The tension is palpable and sustained throughout, expertly fueled by a fittingly repetitive musical score and a hand-held, visceral cinematography. Crucially, the film avoids any bombastic build-up to a climax, instead maintaining a continuous, suffocating sense of urgency. This masterful approach strongly evokes the equally excellent tension of United 93.

It's a genuine pity that this film isn't receiving a wider cinematic release. The terrifying, internalized fear it generates in a darkened cinema is an experience that will undoubtedly be diminished when watched from the comfort of a home sofa. This is a movie that demands to be seen on the biggest screen possible.",figurative
"Ghosts UK vs Ghosts CBS I'm sorry to say that the CBS version of Ghosts UK turns out to be a dumbed down version of the original.

I hadn't seen Ghosts UK and started watching the CBS version. The first few episodes were excellent and I had high hopes that I'd found a new clever series, but after the first season, it became sadly annoying. Even when using the episodes of the UK show to copy from, the CBS writers found a way to dumb them down.

I learned this because when I couldn't stomach watching season two of Ghosts CBS, I started watching the BBC original and the difference was striking. In all five seasons of Ghosts UK the writing was brilliant and never let up. I only wish that Ghosts UK was not ending the series with season five.",literal
"The Fall of Netflix Rages On.... My hope is somewhere in the future, AI will be able to scan new releases to evaluate and rank movies on multiple scales, so we can make a reasonable assumption about the likelihood of enjoying a theater experience. These stars and tomatoes are too easily manipulated. I got duped by the 79% ranking and Kathryn Bigelow branding. This film is NOT Hurt Locker, nor should anyone think it comes close to the brilliant and serious care applied to a very real and serious subject matter.

The first tell was in the opening credits. There it was, the big red ""N"". Netflix. This almost assures you are about to witness and dumbed down, appeal to the masses, short on realism and long on emotion film. The formula is familiar. All female characters, be it mother or CEO, are strong, brilliant, and under appreciated. And the men are all limited by their toxic masculinity or innate inferiority. Save the worst for older white men of the military. They are simple minded rubes just itching to push the red button, bringing an end to humanity just to see their expensive weapons put to use.

The icing on the cake is the depiction of our leadership and military completely befuddled when faced with an emergency as catastrophic as a single incoming ICBM. They counter with a single intercept, and when it fails, everyone freezes, calls their spouses and children and gives up. This is an insult to the professional men of women who have devoted their lives to national defense and preparedness, and who follow set protocols. They don't have a Zoom call and wing it.

Early in the film the tension build was excellent and promised a gripping suspense worthy of the Bigalow franchise. After 20 minutes, it just stalls, and you wait and wait for something in the story that never arrives. When the film flashed the closing credits, the theater audience let a sound that is hard to describe. It was like a ""WTF??"". Then comments such as ""That's the worst movie I ever saw"" and ""Can I get a refund"". T

If you are a film goer that enjoyed Warfare, this is not for you. If you liked Independence Day, this will possibly hold your attention.",literal
"Underwhelming after all the hype it got There was so much hype for this movie, so my expectations were set extremely high.

While watching It, I was getting so bored as cheap jump scares kept on piling up one after the other! No attempt was made to try and make this film more cleverly constructed. It was just cliché after cliché! There were a few genuinely scary moments, but they still felt underwhelming.

As for the acting, Alexander Skårsgard did a phenomenal job playing Pennywise, and the younger cast was heartwarming too. Overall, It is an acceptable horror movie, but not a very memorable one.",literal
"Chuck Jones, Boris Karloff, and other sadly missing influences. Since this is a Christmas movie, I'll be as kind as I can while still being honest.

I gave the movie a 6, but only because I felt the movie's production values off-set the disappointing adaptation.

I think that most people, regardless of how they felt about the movie after seeing it, would agree on one thing: Jim Carrey is very much his ""usual self"" (think Ace Ventura, Mask, Tony Clifton, and a half dozen vague impersonations).  For those who are fans of Jim Carrey's manic over-the-top delivery, this is... fine.  For those who aren't, it will undoubtedly ruin the experience for them.

Had I never seen the original ""Grinch"" book or cartoon, I most likely would have enjoyed this movie a lot more.  Unfortunately, I've read/seen them several times throughout my life, making it very difficult to separate them from what I was viewing on-screen.  Had I not been overly familiar with Jim Carrey's usual mannerisms, I would have been able to more easily lose myself in the Seuss-like environment.  Unfortunately, I kept seeing the Grinch bursting into seemingly un-Grinchy comedy bits.  (What did the ""Ron Howard as director"" sketch have to do with anything?)

Now, the good points: the scenery, while not exactly natural-looking, definitely had that curvey, distorted Seuss-like perspective, with the occasional dash of Chuck Jones-ian skewed angles as well. The makeup was incredible on everyone, the computer animation segments were impressive enough to fool most people, and Anthony Hopkin's narrative portions were the closest one could get to the original story.

--------------------- SPOILER WARNING: If you haven't seen the movie and you intend to, don't read the next paragraph.  Skip to the paragraph after that one.  Thank you.

--------------------- A few gripes: Could they have come up with a more disturbing method to have the Grinch's heart grow two sizes? It looked quite painful.  Also, since when did the Grinch harbor Oscar the Grouch sensibilities?  His lair resembled a cross between Blankman's secret headquarters, Oscar's trash can, and Pee-Wee's Playhouse.  Max the dog, while well-trained, seemed a bit too much like Benji; and Cindy-Lou Who, who was ""no more than two"", is suddenly six or seven and more intelligent than the entire adult population.  At times I felt like I was watching ""Horton Hears A Hackneyed Cliche'"": the mysterious orphan in a basket, the alienated  child, the unrequitted love; at one point, I felt like I was watching Disney's ""Hunchback Of Notre Dame,"" when they gave the Grinch an award and ultimately humiliated him in public, much to the dismay of the secret love interest. -----------------------------

For those of you who didn't read the spoiler, it's okay, I'm done ranting now.  I went into the movie really wanting to like it - expecting to like it, in fact.  I went away feeling a bit like Cindy-Lou Who did at one point in the film: Too much shallow sentimentality and glittery flash, not enough 'keeping it real'.  It's a cute Christmas movie, and somewhere in it there's a moral, albeit a muddled one; but if you're looking for a faithful recreation of a cartoon classic, you might have better luck with ""Popeye"", ""Inspector Gadget"", and ""Casper"".

I'm sorry, but I don't see the ""funny"" in bad camera work.

I don't see the ""funny"" is not being able to see the action.

In other words, The Office is so bad, it's neither smart nor funny, and it would be so nice if its incompetent producers would use some of their brain cells to figure out why nobody watched their show in spite of all the awards.

Could it be that the audience is a lot smarter than those awards-people who vote for the biggest fruit basket they got?",figurative
"Insightful I am obsessed!!!! This show has shown great insight into Gibb's mind and how he got started. I can't wait to see more of it. I think the backstory of how him and franks met has been lovely especially since now we know why they were so close.

I won't spoil it for anyone because I hate spoilers too. Casting is absolutely perfect.

"Many Too Serious Here This is British sex farce that puts all others to shame -- except there is no shame here.

If you can accept it for what it was -- not what it isn't, now -- and resist being revisionist about it, then you can enjoy it in spite of yourself. The ladies are lovely, the stories are silly and the acting is more than adequate throughout. Appreciation of it is helped if you were in at least your late adolescence when it was made, in 1969, can still remember what society and culture were like then, and haven't yet lost your sense of humor and the absurd. And to see the sets from ""Oliver"" and ""Scrooge"" in a decidedly different kind of film only adds to the enjoyment.

It's also worthwhile considering it as a Joanna Pettet double-feature, with the other one being Casino Royale (1967), which is also guaranteed to offend many currently but is still worth a watch to fully appreciate those times and mores. Might want to give ""Barbarella"" a look, too, for a David Hemmings tie-in.",literal

Amazing concept Just finished watching the pilot. The characters here are amazing they're funny interesting and have their own way of expressing what sin do they represent. The concept of this show of having a daughter in hell is very interesting the very first that I've seen. Very inspiring hope there will be more information on Charlie's backstory.,literal
"Building to a blockbuster The first episode sets the stage for what looks to be a great season. All of the strange and creepy things that make Derry the home of Pennywise and twist and turns you dont expect. Great pilot episode that is building the season. Remember is this an 8 hour season with new characters and story lines. If the producers made every episode a skeleton carbon copy of the new movies it wouldn't leave much to fear or your imagination, and isn't that what the ""Eater of Worlds"" feeds on and is all about?",literal
"Im not sure,,, Not sure what I think about this actually, but I am hesitated about it , the acting was on the limit and production was close to low budget, but ok , I can go further with that but what I dont like is the story by it self, its just weird and not in a good way

I also cant see anything funny in this drivel, its not a comedy but it think it is a comedy but nothing is funny, you yawn alot but you dont laugh about anything

Yet alot of people liked it , and its just typical cause this is just one of these movies people like cause its a bit weird and crazy

No its not that good, you can watch it on a hangover sunday with a pizza but not on a friday evning with popcorn.",literal
"The most entertaining show of 2015. One Punch Man was originally a Japanese web-comic created by ONE, which was adapted into manga format by Yusuke Murata and now, in 2015, into an anime created by Madhouse. It follows the adventures of Saitama - a man who used to enjoy being a superhero as a hobby, until he was plagued by unbelievable power; allowing him to defeat any opponent in just one punch. Let me begin by saying that this is my first online review and nothing but the feeling of total ecstasy I found myself in after completing the first season of One Punch Man compelled me to write this piece. 

The amount of hype shrouding this show is something I was unaware of when I first viewed it after being shown it by a friend; but looking back I find it impossible to argue any point other than that One Punch Man deserves all of the acclaim that it has received. At the time of my first viewing the show had already reached its eighth episode and I can safely say that watching all eight episodes in a row was one of the most entertaining sittings of television I've ever experienced (I've now watched all twelve and can confirm that the show only gets better). In my opinion, the show is perfect because it knows exactly what it is - and embraces that fact brilliantly. It is incredibly fast paced, action-packed and funny, whilst still managing to develop it's main protagonist to a point where, for me, it was impossible not to love Saitama. 

When praising the show you have to begin with the animation, which is impeccable. The fight scenes look aesthetically beautiful and the landscapes appear full and perfectly detailed whilst seamlessly blending countless different animation styles together. It was however the pacing of the show that encapsulated me entirely. Although I do enjoy anime I would not call myself the greatest fan of the genre by any stretch of the imagination and even some of my favourite anime shows I found to be very drawn out at points (Hunter X Hunter and Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood being examples). One Punch Man drew me in from the get go because it began at full throttle and never even showed signs of slowing down. To me, the show seemed to know exactly what a fan of anime wanted to see and displayed it perfectly in each episode. Each episode acts as a deconstruction of the typical anime set-up, parodying the use of filler episodes by removing any living trace of even the idea of filler taking place. This doesn't mean that Saitama is the only developed character in the show, the use of side characters to forward the plot is masterfully done. A special mention has to go to Genos - Saitama's cyborg sidekick seeking to learn the secrets to his master's power; I found the character very likable and was excited every time he fought an opponent in the show due to his awesome design. 

The main criticisms of the show I've seen online is that the idea of Saitama defeating any enemy with a single punch is very limited, or that there is no development in his ability. Firstly, there is no doubt that the show is aware of the stupidity of its concept, but rather than hold this against itself, uses this to create some of the best humour I've seen not only in anime, but in Western cartoons too. In terms of the development of Saitama as a character, the show plays wonderfully on the fact that most animes begin with a weaker character whom after defeating enemies across a journey eventually reaches his peak, creating a perfect parody of this concept with our impossibly powerful protagonist. The depth and of Saitama's character for me is the show's finest strength, I even found myself relating to him at points far more than I ever expected to. Saitama's passion and desperation to find a worthy opponent and once again find enjoyment in his hobby and his search for what it means to truly be human, are aspects of the show that add a layer of depth that many other shows strive for. 

Before watching One Punch Man I had never read a manga before, but instantly after finishing the final episode of the first series I downloaded Manga Rock and read the entire One Punch Man manga through to its current chapter in one sitting. This alone tells me that One Punch Man is not only an amazing anime, but an inspiring story that plays on the tropes of it's genre perfectly. If the second season of One Punch Man follows the manga as closely as the first, then I can't wait to see what Madhouse have to offer for the next chapters.

Overall, I have to rate One Punch Man 10/10 because for me the show identified any issue that I've ever had with an anime and either eradicated it totally, or span it around into hilarious ironic humour. A special mention has to go from me to Yusuke Murata as when I looked at the manga I couldn't believe that frame for frame it looked even better than the outrageously beautiful anime. If you're not a fan of anime or manga I strongly suggest you try out One Punch Man because it truly deserves the hype it has received. I recommend this show to any person who is a fan of anime, action, comedy, cartoons and generally great television. Roll on season two!",figurative
"Every bit as good as you've heard I'd put off watching BREAKING BAD for years and years, not being particularly interested in a contemporary story about a couple of drug dealers, but I needn't have worried. This is a series that lives up to all the accolades, just as involving and gripping as I'd hoped. About half a dozen actors give career best performances as characters that evolve slowly and realistically over five seasons, and the depth is incredible, along with the refusal to paint a single person in black and white. Humour, suspense, action and the depths of the human existence being frequently explored; there's really nothing better.",literal
"Funny, glamorous, good story If you are looking for a funny, glamorous, smart look at the glamour of the late 60's I really enjoyed.

Watched the first half of first episode and wasn't sure, then the second half got me completely hooked. The main character is great on her role and believable as this kooky socialite wannabe. The incomparable carol Burnett is great as always. The supporting cast is great too and all have rounded characters and personalities. If you want a bit of escapism give it a go , it's fun caper but it also has the script and the budget to back it up , I am very much looking forward to a second series .",literal
"Skip this one This movie is convoluted with no real plot. It's a bunch of jump, scares with some big name actors. I was so disappointed. I waited all the way through the end of the movie for this to be tied together and it just left you hanging. There were gross inconsistencies and plot holes, for those who still want to go see it I won't provide any spoilers, but this is a strong recommend to not see this movie.",literal
"Hardest Watch of the Year This was one of the hardest watches for me of the year, but also one of the best. I went in to the theater blind, and left horribly depressed. This film perfectly toes the line between bleak and comedic. Each participant felt like a fully fleshed out person and gives insight in to the camaraderie shared between humans when faced with the inevitable end. I was worried the film would fall in to long held tropes, but I was pleasantly surprised at multiple points in the narrative. You know each boy will die, but each time the end comes, you're hoping, somehow, they'll get away. This film broke my heart. I loved it. I hated it. I hope I never watch it again, but I'm glad I did.",literal
"Acting was absolutely awful I didn't believe in the actresses playing. ""Morgan"" with one face during the whole movie, ""Clara"" absolutely talentless about emotions on screen. Fake crying was horrible, like my toddler who wants extra treats.

The grandpa was too invisible, without real sarcasm and irony.

The only people who did a good job are ""Miller"", ""Lexie"" and ""Efren"". Well done!!!

I wasted two hours of my life. It's a shame.",figurative
"Chad Powers Delivers Heart Laughs and Pure Fun Chad Powers is a wonderful surprise. The whole cast does an amazing job and every actor feels natural on screen. The main character is especially impressive. He plays two different personas so well that you can honestly forget it is the same person. He switches between them with ease and it feels real every time.

The show has creative storytelling that feels fresh and full of charm. The comedy is light and fun and the emotional moments are touching in a very genuine way. It is the kind of series that sneaks up on you and makes you care without even trying. It has the same warm and uplifting feeling that many people love about Ted Lasso.

Chad Powers is a hidden gem. It keeps you wanting more and it deserves much more attention. I highly recommend watching it. Please give us a season 2.",figurative
"Jurassic Meh: Dinosaurs Deserve Better As someone who's watched every entry in the Jurassic Park and Jurassic World franchises, I have to say, this latest installment is the most disappointing of them all. But should you skip it entirely? Absolutely not. It still works as a decent popcorn flick if you're just in the mood for some dino-action without expecting much else.

When Scarlett Johansson was announced as part of the cast, I had high hopes for a standout performance, especially given her strong track record and the charisma Chris Pratt brought to the previous Jurassic World films. Unfortunately, the film doesn't give her much to work with, and her potential feels underutilized.

What really lets this movie down is its tone. The signature humor that helped balance the tension in earlier films is noticeably absent. Even worse, the horror and suspense hallmarks of any good dinosaur movie are dialed way down, leaving the action feeling flat.

The story itself is a mess. It stumbles at the start, never quite finds its rhythm, and ends without impact. The plot feels disjointed, and the characters are poorly developed, you never feel emotionally invested in what's happening.

And then there's the CGI. For a franchise known for groundbreaking visual effects, this entry is shockingly subpar. The effects are shabby and unconvincing, which really takes you out of the experience.

Bottom line: it's a missed opportunity in almost every way. Still, if you're a fan of the series or just want to see dinosaurs on screen, it's worth a one-time watch, just lower your expectations.",literal
"A soap opera with really unbelievable medical practice The premise of this show is a study of addiction in a Nurse who can function while still being an addict. The focus is supposed to be on the characters and their interaction with one another. The problem is that it's set in a hospital where the medical situations are totally implausible and unbelievable. Many of the things that the nurse does in the series would just not be possible in a hospital. She knows more than the doctors, speaks to people like she's in charge etc. While I'm all for strong female leads in series, they have to be put in believable situations, not constantly living in a fantasy world. This departure from reality gets worse as the series progresses. If attention had been paid to detail, and maybe the show had a medical consultant to advise on the situations, it might have a bit more credibility.",literal
"Rapidly going downhill I thought the Witcher is about a monster, demon, witch slayer etc... The first season brilliant and it was exactly that, second season was ok definitely not the same quality, however season 3, it looks like a latin telenovela that my grandma would see. They are more focused on showing a romance plot that actually develop de story, in the first 5 episodes nothing is going on, literally nothing. One again the magic of netflix, everything that their executives touches become pure rubbish. It's evident that they believe once a franchise takes off it will be rock solid and they don't need to put any effort and lay down. Also it's ok to keep pushing for good writing and stop founding and being exigent to this department. Well that's why netflix is losing clientel.",literal
"Easily the best rom com in 20 years Well done. It is a fun ride and the writers avoid all the tropes that would have been easy to write but predictable. The acting is very well done. Bell and Brody have good chemistry. Lupe and Bell are sisters from other parents. Feldshuh brings life to a probable tired role in any other actors hands. The entire cast brings their A games. There really is not a weak link in this cast. I lost myself in every episode and caught myself laughing and gasping in the middle of the same scene multiple times.

As it always should this review begins and ends with writers. Way to go team, hope season 2 is able to meet the high standard set by season 1.",literal
"The Black Phone 2 is a worthy sequel The Black Phone 2 genuinely impressed me. It's a rare sequel that manages to be both terrifying and emotionally grounded.

The eerie setting immediately sets the tone, and with Scott Derrickson back in full force. His trademark Super 8 segments are once again a highlight, perfectly capturing that unsettling atmosphere he's known for. Derrickson proves he still knows how to make horror feel real. I found the sound design to be one of the film's strongest aspects. Loud and immersive.

The story carries surprising emotional weight, anchored by characters we actually care about. It's engaging and well-paced, though at times the structure does feel slightly repetitive. Still, those moments are quickly forgotten once the horror kicks in and when it does, it hits hard.

The performances are consistently strong, especially Madeleine McGraw and, of course, Ethan Hawke, who transforms the Grabber into something truly unhinged.

The Black Phone 2 delivers some chilling scares, grounded emotion, and top-tier direction. With this film, Derrickson reaffirms his place as one of horror's finest.",literal
"There is no such thing as perfection, but there is such a thing as legendary Spoilers

Reading some of the reviews, a lot of critics seem to bring up that the show doesn't have character development, or that one punch man has no competition. These reviewers watch the show without considering what this anime is. 

It started out as a humorous web comic and turned into an action/comedy anime series with the best animation I've seen in recent years. Period. From both Japan and America aside from Studio Ghibli.

Now I stress again; it's a comedy. Comedies may not be for everyone, but again, IT'S A COMEDY/action anime. Do you watch Kevin Hart for the story? Do you watch Gabriel Iglacias for the story? Do you watch Saturday Night Live for the story?

Absolutely not. 

We were gifted this eye candy and you want to complain about the 'story' of a bald man who did one hundred push-ups/sit-ups and ran 5 miles a day for two years and, just with that workout, got strong enough to punch a hole though a f***ing asteroid? Are you serious? 

I mean, a man turned into a giant crab-man because he ate too much crab, and some kid drew nipples on him while he was sleeping causing the crab-man to go on a mass-murdering rampage. Don't judge a comedy/visual masterpiece as if it were Sherlock Holmes or some other serious story based show, a**holes.",figurative
"Take A Pass On This It's awful, awful, awful. In looking at the credits, I understand why Kim has star billing. She & her mother probably put up most of the money for this trash. As a matter of fact though, all the starring actress' are EPs. I had high hopes after reading the description. They were dashed about 15 minutes into 1st episode. Too cringy to stay.",literal
"I have never been so let down I don't even know what to say. There was so much wasted potential here. I will say that the cinematography, the location, and the children (The Losers Club) hold up really well for this film. Yet, I'm still sitting here after seeing this premiere and I'm still shaking my head. 

Here is the one thing for me, that ruined the movie. If you don't want any spoilers I suggest you stop reading. Here goes..

What is going on with all the CGI in this film? Computer animated graphics have never scared me and this movie is littered with seemingly terrible and unimpressive visual effects. I had a feeling this was going to happen after watching the directors previous film ""Mama"" Anytime something was seemingly scary, or anytime I thought ""Hey, this movie might redeem itself"" it was almost instantaneously followed by some cheap jump scare with a villain who was computer animated to look scary. The human eye is easy to detect how fake CGI can be and folks, let me tell you, this movie relies INCREDIBLY HEAVILY on computer animated effects. No incredible monster movie effects from the 80s here. The sad part about it is that the movie takes place in the 80s (instead of the 50s like the book). What better way to write a beautiful love letter to the time period than to get some natural, realistic, and horrifying movie effects? The 70s had The Exorcist. Top notch REAL effects. Do you remember The Thing from the 1980s? ThHOSE PRACTICAL EFFECTS STILL HOLD UP TO THIS DAY. Its truly sad to see computer programs taking the forefront to create scares. Anyway, I'm rambling...

For all of you fans of the book out there.. Spoiler alert again..

You WILL be disappointed. It only uses the book as a small guideline for the story they decided to craft here. There is no Ritual of Chud. There is no Mummy, Werewolf, or drowned children in the Standpipe. Everything is rushed. This film is just a complete mess and it pains me to say so. 

If you haven't read the book, maybe you'll have a decent time if you can handle CGI. I for one thought IT was extremely disappointing, confusing, and ultimately boring and cliché. God, I wish this could have gone a different way.

If you are truly interested in seeing IT... Please...please.... Save your money and go see something else. Or at the very least, wait to rent it.",literal
"Really guys? Usually I don't feel compelled to comment on these things but I just had to say that most of the people I saw who left negative comments on this show only watched ONE episode! The first episode wasn't my favorite. But you become attached to the characters so quickly! It is hard to say that Michael is just an idiot, he has so much heart and just wants to be loved. I don't care what anyone says, Dwight is hilarious. And the show can be so easy to relate to sometimes. Don't tell me you have never had your Jim or your Pam. I mean, there are so many human moments that sometimes it leaves me feeling emotional (though they are rarer). And it definitely has its uncomfortable moments (especially when Toby starts to get creepy). There is so much good to this show, and it is so unlike so many of the terrible shows out there. I can understand loyalty, and I know America and Britain are different countries. But if you get past the FIRST episode and really give it a chance, there is a lot to love here! I have never seen the original Office, and I intend to watch it someday. And I promise I will keep an open mind.",literal
"Episode 3 First of all, i'm quite sure a CIA agent wouldn't give a damn about any hostages they don't know, even if they did. Some random peopel for a secure CIA passcode? Really? LOL. This is the first and worst part of this episode. I did had something elese to say about the cop that went to the kids hut to get them and they where dancing, he walked a few steps and then they were deep asleep but i wont even get there. Who's making this scripts Chatgpt?",literal
"Abracadabra Now You See Me is a dazzling heist films heavy on style, visual trickery and fast edits. Four amateur magicians (Jesse Eisenberg, Isla Fisher, Woody Harrelson and Dave Franco) are brought together by an unknown controller who groups them together as The Four Horsemen and they soon become top Vegas magicians.

However that is not the end of it. During the finale of an act they pick a random audience member who appears to have teleported into his bank vault in Paris. He is told to switch the ventilation system that blows out Euros on to the Parisian streets. The audience go crazy and the next day the Four Horsemen are brought in for questioning by the FBI.

The bank in Paris was robbed and a prop used in the magic act was found at the scene in Paris.

The magicians are being investigated by a determined but dim FBI agent (Mark Ruffalo) and an Interpol detective (Mélanie Laurent) who seemed to be more in tune with the conjurer's slight of hand techniques.

The Four Horsemen have a patron (Michael Caine) who promotes their shows and latest tricks. Morgan Freeman is on their trail as he makes a living in exposing magicians tricks and helps out the FBI.

This is just the beginning though. The Four Horsemen become folk heroes as it turns out that their victims are people or corporations who have duped or cheated the ordinary person and now it is payback time.

Director Louis Leterrier keeps his show moving using effects and dazzle. It is frothy fun as the Four Horsemen use all manner of trickery to evade their captures but you kind of guess who the real mastermind is going to be. The clues are laid down as we go along.

I was concerned as to why the Morgan Freeman character was deemed to be a fall guy, he might have been smug but he was not a villain. Also these amateur magicians had skills so magical they must have studied at Hogwarts school of magic. So despite being an enjoyable film, it does fall down on logic but it is fun.",literal
"Good but Dwindling Don't get attached to any character. They'll eventually die. Love the show and overall character (one's that have lived this long) and story development over the years, even the obnoxious characters grow on you to a point. Although seasons before the current of Season 17, it's overall become predicable. Lovr the show but it needs to wrap up before it becomes anymore""same old"" vibe and it dies off after a large chunk of fans lose interest and stop watching.",literal
"The GOATest GOAT of all GOATs PERFECT

Season 1: 8 stars.

Too awesome. Such an intriguing start, especially the opening scene of the pilot. A perfect example of how to do setup while simultaneously having major plot points. You feel the tension immediately.

Season 2: 9 stars.

Amazing. Great escalation.

Season 3: 9 stars.

Wow. Continued escalation plus two of the most memorable scenes ever. Jaw-dropping moments.

Season 4: 10 stars.

I continue to emphasize how beautiful the escalation is. So much stuff happens. Major plot points regularly (something modern shows forgot how to do). And the climax/conclusion is one of the smartest examples of writing. The finale is one of my favorite episodes of any show ever.

Season 5: 10 stars.

Perfection at its finest. So smart. So amazing. Nearly every episode has as much major plot points and excitement as a normal show's season finale. Several scenes with unmatched levels of tension. The escalation is even more escalated. Best show ever.

(First 4 seasons plus first half of season 5 - 4 viewings, second half of season 5 - 3 viewings, 8/18/2024)",literal

If he leaves too and Stella takes over I am DONE WATCHING after watching every episode plus the all day reruns on Tuesday's here!!!,literal
"A show about a bunch of losers This isn't Ozark or Breaking Bad or any of the decent shows we've had over the last decade or two. My biggest pet peeve is protagonists who consistently make stupid decisions and this show has that in spades. I don't even find it believable that these characters would have ever had enough success in the first place to get in as much debt as they are. And I don't even mean just the two main brothers. Like... some of their support staff appear to have talent at making a restaurant but other than that can't seem to handle the most basic aspects of life.

And I don't even know what the point of it is. I don't know why I'm supposed to enjoy a show about two guys going around begging other people to give them money and not kill them for owing them money and at no point do they show any skills or talents or intelligence of their own. I'm at an utter loss as to what the point is. There's plenty of good shows where characters are in debt and making moves to try and keep their head above water, but those characters actually make smart decisions at least SOME of the time. Not the ones in this story. And it's just boring at the end of the day. Stopped after two episodes of these two losers and their loser friends making one dumb choice after another.",literal
"Maybe I'm the wrong age Had high hopes for this as I enjoyed her character in the first Adam's Family movie, and because Tim Burton was involved in this series for Netflix. The first episode gave me hope that her character wasn't going to be messed with, as in watered down into a more friendly Wednesday. However, it turned out I was wrong, as by the end she was hugging her room mate.

That said it wasn't a bad series, it just felt watered down from what it could have been, as is the case with most of what Netflix produce. The story kept me interested throughout and kept me guessing till the end. But ultimately this is typical Netflix fare, nothing too demanding and nothing surprising or shocking. It might sound harsh to some, but Netflix really has become the streaming service of mediocre TV production.",literal
"Great adaptation, Powell shines in his own right. Ben Richards signs up for a brutal televised game show: if he can survive being hunted for 30 days, he can win life-changing money - and potentially save his sick daughter.

Edgar Wright delivers a dark action-thriller set in a dystopian near-future. Based on Stephen King's 1982 novel, which he wrote under the pseudonym Richard Bachman. Unlike the 1987 Schwarzenegger version, Wright's adaptation is much more faithful to the book, turning the story into more of a road movie - Richards is constantly moving, hiding, and meeting different people as he tries to survive.

Cinematography from Chung-hoon Chung is notable, along with the editing by Paul Machliss and music by Steven Price.

There are echoes in the concept of other works like the French novel/film Le Prix du Danger (The Prize of Peril), which King clearly seemed to borrow from, where people are hunted for entertainment. Wright's version stays true to King's themes of media, desperation, and spectacle.

Glen Powell is impressive as Ben Richards: he's tough, scared, determined - Powell brings real emotional weight to the role. The supporting cast is excellent; Josh Brolin plays the ruthless producer Dan Killian; Colman Domingo is memorable as the show host Bobby ""Bobby T"" Thompson; Lee Pace, Michael Cera, Emilia Jones, Daniel Ezra, Jayme Lawson, and William H. Macy all contribute strong performances. Katy M. O'Brian is particularly memorable. There's also a nice nod to Arnold Schwarzenegger (the original's Ben Richards).

The action and stunts are great - you really feel the danger. Wright's direction builds a tense but stylish world, the film has real scope, and the chase sequences feel grounded and raw. Despite the violence and serious stakes, there's also dark humour, and the satire about media and spectacle is sharp.

Fans of the novel will appreciate Wright and Michael Bacall's tweaks for the most part.

Overall, this is a very good adaptation. It respects King's original novel, but it's not just a rehash of the old movie - it stands on its own. If you like dystopian thrillers, action with heart, or just want something a little different, this is well worth watching. Highly recommended.",figurative
"Save ... ... the planet? The person (which one?)? Or ""everyone""? No pun intended, our main character sure likes to believe that he is doing the work for all humanity. We will find out if or how wrong he is ... or right for that matter.

The movie is (loosely) based on a Korean movie - that is over 20 years old. I remember the hair thing, but it has been way too long to remember many more details. I think the original only had two character pit against each other - kidnapping was there too.

So Yorgos made it his own ... and made me want to watch the other movie (again) ... great performances here and while it is quite a mad mad world ... this feels kind of ""normal"" ... still quite violent, so not for the faint of heart ... or too sensitive souls.

Edit: the movie is quite relevant considering the whole conspiracy trail the world is on ... now this still is a movie, so whatever the conclusion or answer to it all is (if you've seen the original you already know, but even if not, it is a binary thing in the end - it's either true and it's ""out there"" ... or someone lost their marbles and the movie is having fun with it) ... do not take this to real life ... if you can.",literal
"Bullseye! What an absolute and pleasant surprise this show is. Good story. Good plot, as well as the characters. Fun to watch, but not all easy going. Satire is often the perspective from which the world is observed, still displays the serious note. Looks and sounds and feels like Fallout. Quite well made adaptation, and quite true to Fallout franchise (video games) too. Right on the target. Really enjoyed watching this show.

Need more Fallout. And regarding that, another season (season 2) is already being made (filmed). All combined, it should not be too long before the second season (hopefully another good one) arrives, I guess.",literal
"Hey, hey, a great look, but just okay otherwise Yeah, I think that the makeup and the art direction is enough for a person to watch. Even if you have serious, very serious, reservations about Jim Carrey in this, and even if you feel that Ron Howard just didn't show the skill that he did in Apollo 13, A Beautiful Mind, or The DaVinci Code, you can admire the technical knowhow. The biggest difficulty for me personally is that I kept wishing I was watching the Chuck Jones animation and hearing Boris Karloff's narration instead. It is a shame, in my elfish opinion, that Ron Howard felt it necessary to include vulgarisms, but we all know that G rating isn't supposed to sell as well as the PG rating. I believe a little research throws that assumption out the window when average box office figures for G rated movies are compared to those for those with ""more mature"" ratings. One other disturbing factor to me was that this film didn't come through as well with the theme of Christmas being more than receiving (and even giving) material gifts. I do believe that this is a good enough film to include in your Christmas viewing, but do compare it with the earlier cartoon version.",literal

"A fun Disney animation without the heart to make it a classic At this present moment in time it feels as though Disney has a license to print money and their certainly not stopping anytime soon with countless remakes on the calendar for the next few years and original properties like last year's Xmas time animated hit Moana that are finding instant successes with their target audiences, that will likely see them become family favourites in the present and the years to come.

You can almost envision the Disney power players gathered around the table, their eyes lighting up at the pitch of Moana, about kindly and magically gifted young girl (continuing on the Mouse House's recent output of strong willed female heroines) that just so happens to be an Polynesian native (covering off the diversity side of requirements) all the while having a story that's conveniently tailored made too a few song and dance numbers that will have the kids singing and adults wishing they never bought the official soundtrack and you can pretty much guarantee in a few years' time Moana will be hitting a stage near you too live its new life as a feel good audience pleasing stage hit.

It really does feel as though Moana owes a lot to past Disney hits like Mulan, The Lion King and recent box office behemoth Frozen and while the island/ocean setting of the story and the addition of everyone's favourite ex-pro wrestler Dwayne Johnson as the voice of Demi-God Maui set's Moana a part from these films, Moana doesn't actually end up delivering anything that fresh or new to the old age staple of young protagonist that doesn't mind being a rebel saving the day after an adventure filled quest and it's a shame that Moana doesn't utilise its ample potential to become anything more than a nice piece of colourful entertainment.

Filled with animal sidekicks (crazy eyed chicken Heihei steals the film), the aforementioned musical numbers that are more pleasant that instantly singable and Moana herself who's voiced with a lot of life by rising star Auli'i Cravalho but the film never truly breaks out to join the ranks of classic Disney heroines, Moana as a whole remains constantly middle of the road and you'd be hard pressed to find many that will be mentioning this outing in the future years as Disney unloads more and more similar fair into the great wide world.

Final Say – 

Energetic and sometimes laugh out loud funny, Moana is an audience appeasing event that's tailor made to keep the little tykes content and the senses dazzled but the heart that transforms some Disney films into the instant classics they become is curiously missing here and it stops Moana from being anything but a mostly forgettable diversion.

I hope this haunts CBS for 5 more seasons I love this show it's absolutely awesome. I know there's a BBC version that came first but this one is really fun and it's different and there's no cops and robbers and thieves or anything like that ... it's just fun. Really needed a serieslike this. I hope it lasts many more seasons. The characters are fun there's great chemistry between the entire cast and especially between the wife and the husband.,literal
"Timely crowd pleasing blockbuster It's easy to see why they chose to redo The Running Man now and the film isn't even remotely subtle in its commentary about misinformation, class divide and TV designed to spread hate but this is also an emotionally investing blockbuster in which an everyman tries to take down an incredibly broken system that's rigged against him. It maintains its momentum as well as a high amount of tension throughout and delivers the necessary thrills.

Glenn Powell is superb in a leading performance that puts more on his shoulders than any of his previous roles whilst being another strong showcase for his talents. He has a very palpable anger contrasted by a sensitive side for those he cares about, making him the ideal protagonist. There's a great supporting cast too with Colman Domingo being an extremely boisterous host, Josh Brolin as a ruthless villain and Michael Cera getting the best scene.

Edgar Wright's direction isn't as recognisably him as his previous work (though some flourishes are present) but he still does a fantastic job by making this look suitably bleak yet simultaneously stylish and stages quite a few inventive action sequences. Chung Chung-hoon's clean cinematography employs satisfying extended takes which are fitting for a movie that's almost always moving and Steven Price's retro score matches the film's manic energy.",literal
"Very enjoyable feel-good movie. THE SANDLOT is quite possibly one of the best ""family films"" ever made. In it, a young, studious, unpopular boy named Scotty Smalls (Tom Guiry) moves to a suburb just before school lets out for the summer, and concurrently has a hard time making friends. He frequently sees kids playing baseball in a sandlot in his neighborhood, and wants to make friends with them. He figures the best way to do this is to join in on their baseball games--but alas, Scotty has almost no baseball skills, while the other kids are very experienced and good at the game. One day, the neighborhood hero Benny (Mike Vitar) approaches Scotty and asks if he'd like some pointers and to join in on their game. Scotty agrees, and slowly improves, while making friends with the other boys in the neighborhood.

But one day, Scotty foolishly takes his stepfather's baseball autographed by Babe Ruth and knocks it into the adjacent backyard. This backyard, as Scotty is informed, is home to The Beast, a monstrous dog that, as legend has it, ate the only other boy who was daring enough to go after a baseball in that yard. The boys devise a plan to get the ball back, one way or another.

I watched THE SANDLOT several times growing up, and remember always loving it. When I watched it again recently, I realized exactly why--it's a great movie. Just the right balance of childhood innocence and experience is captured, and this movie is bound to make any adult remember his childhood and all the different aspects of it. The summertime atmosphere and almost all of the scenes are terrifically nostalgic. Some of the scenes involving The Beast are hilarious, and everything has a nice familiar feel to it. It's a wonderful feel-good film.

All of the actors put in at least average performances. Most of the child actors are just okay, with a few exceptions. Tom Guiry is good as the awkward and naive Scotty, as is Patrick Renna as the outspoken and witty Hamilton. I think the real standout of the actors, though, is Mike Vitar as Benny. He was excellent as the kindhearted, but still very cool hero of the neighborhood, the guy that everyone loved. He showed real promise, and it's a shame that he didn't continue with his acting career. The cameos from James Earl Jones and Denis Leary are also nice.

I always loved watching THE SANDLOT growing up, and now I remember why. It's a great family film that is very entertaining and enjoyable to watch. I'm sure I'll watch it again years from now and remember just why I loved it. 8/10.",literal
"Great production value but lame story I've got a mixed bag opinion on the new Frankenstein movie, giving it 6 stars out of 10. Im praising the production value, but feeling a bit underwhelmed by the story, saying it's more about a man's longing for significance than a horror tale. The performances are ok, thr costume design is marvelous. But again, the characters are bit off. Not so interesting.",literal
"It deserved the ""Razzie"" award for worst script... A lot of money was spent in turning this Ron Howard production into a full-length feature with JIM CARREY as ""The Grinch,"" but I'll take the 1966 animated version any day over this overstuffed fantasy.

The director obviously gave Carrey license to ""go for it"" with some moments of comedy enough to produce a few chuckles, but Carrey's lack of restraint reaches manic proportions before the film is half over and his sickly green and grotesque make-up is an unappetizing sight to behold in those huge close-ups. The film (at all times) strains too hard to be a quirky imitation of the original Dr. Seuss cartoon and is simply not up to the job. It's a mess. 

Furthermore, none of the supporting characters are more than mildly entertaining. TAYLOR MOMSEN is a lovely little girl but she can't sing and she substitutes a look of placid, wide-eyed wonder for acting while Carrey heats up the screen with his overacted mugging. CHRISTINE BARANSKI has a flair for comedy but she's been seen to much better advantage in other roles and looks more than mildly uncomfortable as the woman secretly in love with ""The Grinch."" Actually, most of the time she looks as though she can barely tolerate looking at him.

There's a perky background score, some over-luxurious sets, some ghastly looking costumes for the Whoville residents, and the overall feeling one gets is that the slim plot has been expanded to the point where it overstays its welcome. The over stuffing doesn't just apply to the sets and costumes and special effects. The script tries to set up a flashback of ""how"" the Grinch became what he is, but it has a dulling effect that only succeeds in slowing down the ponderous pace of the film's last hour

The script rightfully won a ""Razzie"" as worst of the year, so the blame can't be placed entirely on director or star. My advice: If you want to do justice to Dr. Seuss, do it with animation and not live actors.

Summing up: Not a shred of charm. It's as if ""Opie"" meets Tim Burton.",literal
"Night and Day Difference - Season 1 gets a 7, Season 2 gets a 4 Season 1 sort of snuck up on me. I stumbled across the second or third episode and watched out of curiosity. The setting was intriguing, the approach to the police investigations somewhat novel and refreshingly focused on teaching, and the acting above average. In the lead, Sutherland has a deceptively relaxed but penetrative portrayal of the police chief, and his part was generally better written than most of the supporting cast.

Sadly, Season 2 (so far, only 2 episodes) has dropped noticeably in nearly every measure. The writing quality of the 2 aired episodes as of this review is awful - night and day compared to any episode from Season 1. Dialogue is vacuous, what little mystery present is not at all compelling , and the other police officers, some of whom had engaging acting and parallel stories in the first season have now been apparently reduced to two-dimensional (and trope-laden) placards surrounding the leads. I'll keep watching in hopes for improvement, but so far this is a very disappointing follow up to a promising debut.",literal
"Simple Song with an Effective, Familiar Chorus Summertime nostalgia for the carefree days of yore, when friendship, mischief and baseball was the extent of a young boy's concern. And actually, those first two points are ancillary. Baseball is where it all begins and ends.

I didn't grow up in 1960s California like these kids, but their experiences are eerily familiar. As, I'll wager, is the case with most men beyond a certain age. We're products of a day when parents would send their children out, unsupervised, to find their own way in the world until a certain designated supper time. That open sense of freedom, and the alternating feelings of fear and discovery that accompany it, is key to understanding why The Sandlot is so well-loved. Either you lived it and you see it, right there on the screen, or you didn't, and it misses you.

It's got shortcomings - lots of shortcomings, actually - but that warm overriding sentimentality smooths over a lot of the rough spots. The effects work on that big, scary junkyard dog might be laughable, but hey, such threats really do seem exaggerated and scary when you're twelve years old. Did the city actually light enough Independence Day fireworks to illuminate the neighborhood baseball diamond for a once-a-year night game? Probably not, but I'll bet it seems that way through the fog of a few decades' unreliable memory.

Simple and predictable, with an overdose of ""for the love of the game"" axioms, but also good-natured and playful; it's nice to visit this world, to recall your own similar childhood adventures, even if you can't completely overlook its schmaltzier limitations.",literal
One of best Sword Fighting series ever Awesome Best strong story and it's gonna be better than anymore Best fighting scenes created.

"Ohw my god, yes! And then I found this hidden pearl. I've seen the first 3 episodes and I'm liking it. Phases like in Episode 2 ""just say anything to agree"" yeah, my kind of humour. I'm really hoping that they will make the sensible decision and don't stretch it if this does become a success and they see dollar signs, because then we are again in for bad writing, bad plots and 100% bad final episode.",literal
"Confusing but okay I binged ""Wayward"" over two days on Netflix, and I don't know if that made it harder to follow or just pointed out its storytelling problems more succinctly. And although I found it confusing to follow, it did manage to keep my interest throughout.

Toni Collette is the star and is good as always, playing the charismatic leader of a creepy school for wayward kids who undergo questionable counseling treatments. Mae Martin, who wrote ""Wayward"" and plays the main character, Alex, is the cop who realizes something is wrong there and is determined to bring it down. Throw in his pregnant wife who was a former student of the school, two teenage girls from different backgrounds and a whole town of people you can't trust and it's the challenge of keeping up with all their stories-plus lots of flashbacks-that make it all hard to keep straight.

In addition, a lot of people leaving reviews are confused about Martin, and in a world that seems to insist on clear gender identities, confusion reigns here. I was under the impression initially that Alex was transgendered. However, considering Martin identifies as nonbinary, perhaps Alex is too. He has had chest surgery and is taking testosterone injections and is referred to in the masculine, but he isn't the most masculine transgendered man I've ever seen. I mean, they blend. Perhaps Alex is just starting and the T hasn't kicked in yet? I am open minded and trans-positive, but the character of Alex even threw me off. Plus, I only know Martin as a stand up comedian, so seeing them in a drama was just hard to accept. I do hope Martin's next foray is back into comedy.

The production values were a little cheap and with the exception of Collette, the acting was fine at best. But in spite of its issues, I did want to see how it wrapped up-although I wasn't particularly surprised or interested when I got there.

I give it a generous 6 only for Collette. She's not one of my favorite actresses, but she lifted this one up.",literal
"Well I Still Miss Castle, But This is Pretty Good Nathan Fillion will always be Castle, but he is now, ""The Rookie."" I really enjoy this program. Is It formulaic? Well, yes it is. Is it predictable at times? Sure. Do I care? Why do I not care? It is well directed; superbly written and 'Castle' is now on the other side of the badge. The show has a very good pace, and there's always something new jumping out of the screen. This show is a keeper, at least for me. No politics, no in-your-face PC garbage, and fun. I do hope this show sticks around for a while, I am enjoying it very much. There really isn't much to watch other than butchered retreads and totally successful attempts at pandering tedium. Stick around for some seasoning please.",literal
"Postpartum depression and self destruction Die My Love might be Lynne Ramsay's most polarizing film to date, as from my screening, a few walked out showing discomfort and disgust. I, however, am the one to think this is another banger from Ramsay.

What Lynne is amazing at is that she never strays away from displaying dark yet unique portraits about the the human condition, and some of it's darkest moments in life. Her direction on the atmosphere, writing and character developments are slow, yet, they feel realistic, brutal, weird, and uncomfortable, in the best way possible. Throughout, there are many strong components with her direction as the tone both being dramatic and some black comedy elements were blended well. Alongside with the beautiful camerawork, sound designs, colorful production, and atmosphere, it creates the emphases of isolation, slow-burn tension, and numbness within the characters.

The characters are explored slowly, yet well-developed. The main themes focuses on Postpartum depression and the self-destruction of one's self and mental sanity. Ramsay handles these themes perfectly, blending both dramatic and some comedic tones together. As you are witnessing the characters going through the motions at it's worst and insane moments. Alongside exploring other themes about dysfunctional relationships, neglect, and frustration. All of the performances are fantastic. Jennifer Lawrence completely disappears into her role and gives one of the best performances I have ever seen in her career. Alongside with Robert Pattinson and Sissy Spacek.

The usage of music was perfect, and the dialogue feels purposely clunky but realistic as it fits the tone and character personalities. The pacing is structure slow, yet, perfectly as it builds up the sense of tension and surrealist nature.

I understand this isn't for everyone, and it will make people angry and frustrated. However, I believe this one works a lot. It's a strong vision point and definitely one of my favorite movies of this year.",literal
"World's Best Comedy Series When I watched the first season, the video concept of the series felt very creative. So I decided to watch the second season and I couldn't stop myself :) I'm currently on the 7th season of the series. I watch a little so that it doesn't end :) It's definitely a legendary series with its story, characters and jokes that make you laugh.

"BETTER THAN IT NEEDED TO BE...! A current release still playing in theaters starring Channing Tatum & Oscar nominee Kirsten Dunst. Tatum stars in this real-life tale of Jeffrey Manchester, a ne'er do well thief, who was drummed out of the military even though he was a unique problem solver, who's incarcerated after being caught after robbing a series of McDonald's. Once in prison & feeling the pain of being away from his daughter, Tatum escapes & finds himself in a Toys R Us (remember them?) & decides to make house there & have the run of the place but soon enough he gets stir crazy & wanders about finally finding some purchase in a church where he befriends the congregation, namely the pastor played by Ben Mendelsohn (who worked w/director Derek Cianfrance on The Place Beyond the Plains in 2012) & Dunst, who just happens to work at the same Toys R Us, & being a divorcee w/a pair of daughters, a relationship & romance is struck. Time is on Tatum's side since he has to wait for his army buddy, Oscar nominee LaKeith Stanfield, to provide him some false papers to leave the country but after being caught one night by the Us manager, Peter Dinklage, & quickly jumping butt naked into his hidey hole, that time is soon accelerated which adds to Tatum's dilemma need for freedom & his love for Dunst wreck havor for him. Not a film I wanted to see eventually won me over even though Tatum's protag is the ultimate 'f' up but still charming as hell that won me over even though my neck got a workout from so much head shaking.",literal
"Very good, but uneven. The series has great performances by Jason Bateman and Jude Law, the two leads. I just moved away from NYC, and I enjoyed the Manhattan sites, including some suspenseful scenes in the diamond district.

The plot is a bit uneven, and there are definitely some great episodes and some meh ones. Overall, it was a compelling watch! Recommend it!",literal
"Good but xould have been a lot better Well acted period drama, of events that have been little covered. I enjoyed learning the story about a president (well, two) whom I knew basically nothing about.

But I wish the dialog had been more true to the time frame. I don't think the writers using modern day style of language including all the unnecessary cursing and foul language was a good idea. Compare this to, say Lincoln (the movie), or even Ripper Street (also starring Macfadyen) which was about events happening at roughly the same time as this series, but in London. You'll easily see the difference more true to the times dialog brings.",literal
"An apology Many years ago, a friend of mine told me to watch this new series called Breaking Bad. The way he raved about it I thought I'd give it a go just to shut him up. I really couldn't get in to it and, after the pilot episode, gave up and didn't watch it any more. Fast forward to 2019. Looking through Netflix I came across this series once again so thought I'd give it another go. Now, I don't know if I've changed in these past years or I just didn't give it long enough first time round but, Wow! Over the last three weeks I have binge watched the entire series, averaging four episodes a day (unfortunately I have to work as well). What can I say about this series that hasn't already been said by other reviewers who are more grammatically articulate than I am. It easy to see why Breaking Bad won as many awards as it did. The writing is superb, not to mention the acting from its two main stars, Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul as Walt and Jesse. By the end of the last episode I felt my heart was broken. Like a break up in a relationship I would now have to get by without these two in my life. It's been an emotional rollercoaster of a ride but I enjoyed every minute of it. From Jesse's awkward moment having dinner with Walt and Sky, to Walt's maniacal laughter whilst under the floorboards of his house. So to my friend I owe an apology. I should have listened to you and watched this great show a long time ago.",figurative
"Probably my biggest guilty pleasure I'm not going to lie. I love this entire series. Beginning to end. Is it bad? Probably. Do I love it? Absolutely. I disagree with people saying it should have ended after season 5. I think the later story lines were great and made the show feel like it was a series. Not just a normal cop show that you could pick up anywhere and it was fine. Loved early stuff, but def loved a story line that built. The bugs episode was trash trash. The third wall episode was incredible. And the Scooby-Doo crossover was record breaking. The finale was tough, mostly due to the pandemic and hardcore fans (like me) wanting the perfect ending. I think it was good. It could have been better, but not like Game of Thrones or Lost in the sense that you shouldn't watch the series.

TLDR; phenomenal show. Cw drama. Pretty people, entertaining AF, never winning an Emmy. Few awful episodes, but for a show with over 300 eps, that's a given. Must watch if you love a supernatural (no pun intended) setting and pretty people with mediocre writing). Also, scoobynatural is a work of art. Miss these boys, but mostly miss my girls (Rowena, Charlie, Jody, Donna, and Ruby (Katie Cassidy version)",figurative
"One Punch Man (OPM) will knock your socks off! Let me start by saying that I never skipped the opening song of OPM. The opening (albeit somewhat cheesy) fitted this over-the-top and outrageously cool anime really well. My scouter was reading hype levels of over 9000 when the ""Hero"" opening kicked in (or punched in?).

Studio Madhouse pulled out all their stops when animating this 12-episode wonder.

Protagonist Saitama is a hero for fun, an ordinary human who managed to acquire extraordinary strength. Hero Saitama's strength corresponds to the titular ""One Punch Man"" as he effortlessly beats monstrous opponents to pulp with a single punch. This anime is a satire of superheroes and the whole idea of heroes beating stronger villains effortlessly each time (it takes this premise to an absurd level). Saitama is already (presumably) at the pinnacle of his strength. He gets disappointed each time that no opponent lives up to his power. Normally, formulaic battle anime focus on a protagonist who trains religiously to obtain new powers and skills in order to keep up with a rival while beating powerful enemies. However, OPM does not follow the norm.

Surprisingly this anime stills grabs our attention despite us knowing that the protagonist is absurdly strong from the very beginning and that he will probably never lose a fight. This anime manages to captivate us with this rather plain hero (he is bald and possesses no fancy attacks). With the arrival of Genos (a cyborg hero who is very flashy), the simplicity of hero Saitama becomes apparent. Genos's repertoire of attacks, masculine appearance and seriousness can be juxtaposed to Saitama's plain combat skills, low-key appearance and nonchalant attitude. Interestingly, while Saitama's physical hero feats are commendable and absolutely insane, it is his virtues that makes him a hero in every sense. Saitama does not care that he is being labelled as a fake (lambasted by society); he is also prepared to relinquish his own worth to preserve the value of other heroes. The relationship between Saitama, Genos and the Hero Association is also very interesting.

Give this 12-episode anime a watch. Watch at least 3 episodes before writing this off as this: ""Oh... This egg-headed guy just beat an alien with one punch. Where is the climax? This is stupid. Does this show even have a premise?""

The anime stays true to the manga and is full of vibrant colours, explosions, sonic booms, etc. The animation is eye candy. The whole concept is just fresh.

OPM has already spawned debates like Saitama versus Goku or Superman, and it has engaged the interest of superhero lovers. The final fight in OPM was fantastic. Saitama will be talked about for a very long time. And as I am writing this, I am listening to OPM's intro.",literal
"""Weird"" is right This is a very strange film. On one hand it's perfectly entertaining, but it's so bizarre and - to be blunt - utterly far-fetched and beyond-ridiculous that it actually kind of distracts from the entertainment value at times. The plot is so dumb - and the way it's handled - that suspension of disbelief is pretty hard.

However, if you look at it as a realization of every teenage boy's fantasy, I guess it's all right.

It's essentially about two 15-year-old boys (Ilan Michael-Smith and Anthony Michael Hall) who ""create"" a woman using electricity, a computer and a Barbie doll.

This was my problem with the movie. John Hughes is usually great at character development and dialogue - but there's so little here. The setup is weak and the boys' decision to create a woman is handled waaaay too fast. And then the science behind their actions is ignored so much that it's almost insulting. The ""hacking"" of the computer mainframe that takes place during the Barbie doll's transformation into a human is classic '80s technology - they had no idea what a computer even was back then and as a result the ""hacking"" segment is basically an animated slideshow of cool images on the computer screen as Smith types noisily away on his keyboard.

Their result? The beautiful supermodel Kelly LeBrock, who promptly takes a shower with the boys (their clothes are left on, of course, but hers are not) and then teaches them how to be cool, get girlfriends and so on.

I was surprised by the amount of sexual content for a 1980s movie involving under-age teens. I've seen people say here on IMDb before that '80s movies couldn't get away with anything but that's not true. It may have been the Reagan era but this movie features 15-year-olds making out with a woman in her late '20s, sexual innuendo involving the woman (it's implied one of the two boys has some type of sexual contact with her during the first night), underage drinking, underage smoking, and then of course a classic scene that could never be filmed today - Anthony Michael Hall mimicking African-Americans in a seedy downtown bar.

I don't mean to sound like a prude, I was just shocked at how much they got away with for a 1980s, PG-13 John Hughes comedy.

The acting in the movie is decent. Anthony Michael Hall is a revelation, and his scenes as a drunk pimp in downtown Shermer are hilarious. He comes across as a true comical force, which I was surprised at considering he's not usually the leading man in films.

On the other hand, Smith is poor - he smiles throughout the movie, even when he's supposed to be scared or angry. Maybe it was his first acting job and he was nervous or in disbelief, but it's kind of annoying.

Bill Paxton is responsible for the movie's most memorable scenes. He is utterly hilarious and his scenes were usually the only ones I laughed out loud at.

Overall this is one of Hughes' weakest films and it's probably because it was one of his more early directorial works. In terms of character development, ""The Breakfast Club"" reigns supreme. The dialogue isn't that great and the movie is too short and spends too little time with its setup. It's entertaining if you're not looking for anything of substance, but I think if Hughes had tackled this a few years down the road of his career the result would have been a bit more intelligent and memorable.",literal
"This show just made me SMILE! In 2020, Adult Swim released an animated pilot called ""Smiling Friends"" featuring two guys named ""Charlie"" and ""Pim"" who have a job to make people happy. Everyone watched it and they all loved it so much, even I find it mildly enjoyable. After months of demands from fans all around Twitter and the Internet, Adult Swim finally greenlighted Smiling Friends and boy does that show looked even better than before. The writing in this show is very funny and there are tons of clever Internet references in it, the voice acting is really good by the way. Not to mention, the animation is great, I love how Smiling Friends has shown more of it's traditional hand-drawn animation than it's flash animation, that is pretty incredible. I have got to say that Smiling Friends is easily one of the best Adult Swim cartoons out there and I'm happy this show exists, yet I still want Adult Swim to revive Final Space and greenlight Pibby into a full series. Go watch Smiling Friends if you haven't already, it's a really fantastic show on Adult Swim. I give this show a 9.8/10.",literal
"Bad acting can ruin a good script but good acting cant save a bad one. The most jarring thing is the anachronisms in speech. Using contemporary slang in a movie set eighty years ago shows a young writer who is completely up his own ass trying to be cool or someone who hasn't seen, heard or read something from the period. Another annoying thing is the casualness of the soldiers with their uniforms. No soldier would casually wear the paraphernalia of a sports team or his school while on duty. Maybe wile kicking back in the barracks but that's about it.

Instead of glorifying a show trial that was more or less victor's justice. They should have done a movie about the people wresting with that fact a little less perfunctorily. Showing the people who knew what it was not really caring that much, because who would.",literal
"A fun trip to the 60's with a hot pilot and fabulous farshun! I was instantly attracted to this show from its previews -I loved what it offered - 60's fashion, something a bit fanciful and a little bit intriguing!

I started watching and found myself completely immersed in everything palm Royale- after all what's not to love ? The fashion, the hair do's the cars and the very hot pilot - let's be frank we all want a pilot that looks like that !!

But I like that there's a bit of mystery with Maxine's story. She's a bit of a ditzy gal but at the same time cunning as a mouse . I like its subtle humour and light approach , it's easy watching and gives us all a reason to escape our own fast paced lives and just be in the moment with Maxine! I'm looking forward to unravelling all the layers -clearly there's more to this story!!",literal
Decent new entry to the made-for-tv holiday mix This movie isn't as much a Christmas movie as it is a movie that takes place during the Christmas season. The casting is actually a surprising mix of talent for a TV movie. It helps that the two main stars are actually in real life to add to their on screen chemistry. Less cheesy than other Hallmark alternatives.,literal
"A crime show with humour that just gets better I had just started to watch CSI and was flicking through the the Sky channels and found Navy NCIS on the FX channel. It only took one episode to get me hooked on to it, I like the characters seen to interact and gel with each other. First there's Gibbs the boss played by Mark Harmon, Gibbs is a great character he is serious when it comes to the job but he also has a humour side to him that works well with other characters.

Di Nozzo is funny and again works well with his humour especially with Gibbs.

Caitlin started as the new girl and it has been interesting to her build with her fellow NCIS agents through out the series, It's a shame that actress Sacha Alexander wanted to leave and the producers decided to kill her off, maybe would of been better for her to transfer and leave the door open for future guest appearances.

Abby is the scientist, maybe a female goth version of Gil Grissom and actress Pauley Perrette portrays brilliantly.

David McCallum plays Donald Ducky Mallard the coroner who is often found going off on a tangent and what were the creators drinking the night they come up with that name.

Agent Timothy Mcgee is the latest addition to the show, he started as computer whizz and now has been promoted to a field agent and his scenes with Abby are great.

Long live the NCIS team and I look forward to future series.

Also worth mentioning that Alan Dale stars as Tom Morrow the head of NCIS, most of the soap watching community will remember him in Australian soap opera Neighbours.

Well the above was written after watching the first 2 series of NCIS, so now I thought I would comment on what I think of the show in series 3 and 4.

Got to say it has got even better, not just the stories but the development on the characters. First there is the introduction of Ziva David the Mossad agent who is now working with NCIS. Her character has fitted in well with the rest of the team and her interaction with Tony is good and at times very funny.

Next there is the new director of NCIS who is Jenny Shepherd who is played by Laren Holly, her and Gibbs have a past and it is interesting to see them be reunited and of course Gibbs getting use to her being the boss. Gibbs left then came back (as we knew he would), Agent Lee also joined the team very briefly and does make occasional appearances due to her romance (if you wanna call it that) with Jimmy Palmer.

Also the story of Tony falling in love, Jenny Shepherds obsession of capturing an arms dealer and Magee's bestselling book have kept the series fresh and interesting, and have shown that it is not just one show one story.

Keep up the good work.

Time for another update as season 5 comes to a close in the UK although we are getting to see the first episode of season 6 a few days after it airs in the US.

Another great season from beginning to end, which seen the end of the Frog and also the end Tony's romance with Jeann. Some good stories throughout the series and what a great ending, Jenny Shepheard killed off not sure if she wanted to go or the producers decided to get rid of the character, the ending also see's the disbanding of the team Ziva goes home, Mcgee goes to the cyber crime unit, Tony goes on board a ship and Gibbs gets a new team.

Part of the new team is agent Lee who we have see before, I have read on some websites that fans wont be watching if Gibbs has a new team, the team will be back together,the producers are just making it more unmissable they know that it would kill the show if Tony, Ziva and Mcgee were written out.

Looking forward to season 6",literal
"Impressive cast & keeps you guessing I wasn't expecting to get so wrapped up in this, but Sarah & Dakota are phenomenal actors and the story wasn't an easy giveaway. My expectations were blown out of the park & caught myself actually covering my face during the final 2 episodes. Definitely worth a quick binge, especially if you enjoy whodunnits.",literal
"THIS is PHENOMENAL Not a SINGLE MINUTE in this entire series is a waste of time. Stunning Jeremy leads 100% great cast. Every character is believable, story is original and perfectly crafted/escalated. If you watched (like me) ""We own this city"" and got disappointed then trust me, this series is what Bernthal´s series should have been.

Zero boredom, 100% thrill., great pacing and story, relatable characters, everything works and clicks in this.

Looking forward to second season.",literal
"Great show! I hope this show last! I like the backstory of it and think it will continue to get better. A lot of comments are looking for realism but it's TV so if that is what you are looking for, it's not the show for you! I thought i would f like it but I'm excited to see where it will go. Will she eventually remember slowly? Will she continue to use this opportunity to change or go back the way she was before the accident? Will she continue to be the great doctor that she once was? Definitely lots of drama first starting out but who doesn't love a good deal of drama to start a show and catch their eye!!",literal
"Ethan Hawke's Back!! Sick Crime Comedy, Love it! Two episodes into The Lowdown and I'm hooked. As a huge Ethan Hawke fan (Boyhood, Training Day-all-time favorites), this feels like his wheelhouse: gritty crime noir with PTA-level atmosphere and razor-sharp dark humor. The writing is tight, the tone stylish, and Hawke delivers exactly what I came for. Honestly, thank God Disney brought Kimmel back-Hulu was on the chopping block for me. With The Lowdown and late-night back in the mix, I'm fully back on board. If you're into Hawke's best work, modern noir, or off-kilter humor, this show is a must-watch.",literal
"Solid performance let down by awful writing The story offered nothing substantial...when you don't have anything good to say, say nothing. When you have absolutely nothing to say, maybe don't go and make a movie about it. The story was absolutely blah. Pedro was excellent, Chris was fine, Dakota was ok..if maybe a bit flat which could have been salvaged by the writing but there was no depth to any of the characters. Not every movie needs to change your life but it should at least leave an impression till you walk out of the theatre...this one became painfully obvious where it was headed somewhere along the middle and you couldn't wait to just get it over with and move on with your day. The cinematography and set design was flawless..I was sold into the world but never the story.",literal
"9 episodes is way too long for this Very interesting idea, but the execution is very repetitive. After a certain point, you get bored of the long walks through never ending corridors, same character interactions, and the grim mood this show sets. All of season 1 could easily be fit into a 2 hour movie. The pace pickus up on the last episode, and it is a great episode. But there is no closure. Not even a minor one. The story ends in a cliffhanger, and you are left with more questions than answers. I guess Apple needs people to come back more, but if more and more shows continue this path of releasing incomplete stories, people will wait for all seasons to come before they start watching.",literal
Good Show and Nostalgic The show is nostalgic. I used to watch it on DVD when I was younger and it's truly a good show. I think most ages could watch this and enjoy it. It's worth a try.,literal
"This movie was the best EVER!! I saw this movie about half a year ago. And as soon as i saw it i fell in love with it. I think it's just because i'm only 13 and i like those kinds of movies...also in movies that i watch, they seem better with some attractive guys in them. In this movie Ilan Mitchell-Smith(who played Wyatt) was really hot!

This movie is great, it's by far the best movie from the 80's ever. I think it's awesome to watch it and think of how times have changed movie-wise. This is kind of a cheesy movie compared to movies today, but it's still by far, my favorite ever!

The best part in that movie is where at the end all the bikers come..i can't remember if they were bikers or not, but i think they were. That part was awesome!",literal
"feels more cartoonish this time Just saw Nobody 2 and I'd give it a 7/10. The first one was slick and funny, and this sequel keeps the energy, but it feels more cartoonish this time. The action is wild-Bob Odenkirk still throws hands like a beast, even doing most of his stunts despite his health-props to that commitment

They set it at a tacky water-park resort-think ""National Lampoon's Vacation"" meets John Wick vibes.",literal
"A Reminder It's always valuable to have a reminder of the deep rooted corruption that traditionally threatens democracy in the country, as well as the place of firearms. If viewers note a certain caricature quality to the people portrayed, that's because our jingo-ist reality has become that, something like a political-social satire.",literal
"Exaggerated for effect Dramatizations of real-life people and events are like Cubist portraits - the general outline of the subject is there, but most of the details are greatly distorted for effect. This is very much the case with Mike Makowsky's depiction of the events surrounding the 1881 assassination of President James Garfield by Charles Guiteau. The details are accurate in only the broadest sense: yes, there was an Ohio congressman named James Garfield who had a wife named Lucretia; yes, he was elected president in 1880; yes, he was shot on July 2 of the following year by a deranged assassin who believed he deserved a diplomatic appointment; and yes, he died a lingering and painful death two months later. When it comes to the details in the series, trust nothing beyond that.

And yet Makowsky shouldn't be judged for the liberties he takes with the narrative by throwing Guiteau into more frequent encounters with the major figures of hid day than the historical record can justify. Because in doing so he captures something far truer than one usually finds in an ordinary documentary of events: the earthiness of politics in Gilded Age America. This he does with two intertwined narratives. The first is that of Guiteau, who is in many respects was far from unusual. The politics during that age was filled with people who expected to be rewarded for their efforts on behalf of their candidate with some office and pension. Nor was Guiteau unique in aspiring for more than his limited efforts warranted. Matthey Macfadyen shoulders most the burden of this narrative, and he does so most effectively. I wouldn't be surprised in the least if he earns himself his share of award nominations for his efforts.

The second narrative is the context in which Guiteau operated. This canvas is where the broader historical events take place, and is the more difficult one to pull off. Makowsky does so in no small part thanks to the quality of his cast, all of whom are veteran character actors. At the center of it is Michael Shannon, who has the most thankless task. For the purposes of contrast with the scoundrel of Guiteau he is made into that most improbable of figures: the politician as a saint. Reduction into two dimensions may be an effective tool from the writer's perspective, but it gives Shannon little to do beyond suffering through the filth of the politics surrounding him. It's a disservice both to Shannon and the historical Garfield, and it's a testament to Shannon's skills as an actor that he makes as much of it as he does.

Shannon's burden is all the more obvious for the contrast with the actors around him. By far the most entertaining is Nick Offerman, who is a real treat as Chester Arthur. He seems almost born to play a crude machine politician, and if he wasn't enjoying himself in the role then he's an even better actor than he is regarded. Not far behind him is Shea Whigam as Roscoe Conkling, who is fantastic as the villainous Roscoe Conkling. The two are so good in their respective roles that they pull off the impressive feat of overshadowing Bradley Whitford's performance as James Blaine, who is somewhat unfairly shunted to the sidelines as the series goes on. Yet arguably the best of the bunch is Betty Gilpin as Lucretia Garfield. Her final scene with Guiteau is a fine example of her ability to turn the thankless role of suffering helpmate into something far greater, and the series could have taken better advantage of that than they did.

These performances help to bring the era to life. Through them and the rest of the cast the viewer sees a portrayal of a crass nation where greed is openly dominant, where the mighty jockey for advantage while those lower down the scale scramble for the scraps. If anyone sees parallels in any of this with our own politics today, it demonstrates how little different we really are from that era. In that respect the miniseries offers a surprisingly relevant look at the consequences of the contest for political power, of how even the best intentions are swamped in a mire of corruption and competition. It also helps us to consider the changes that we made that brought us to where we are today, as well as the folly of those who wish to undo them and go back to the way things were. It's a point that is all the clearer through the exaggerations of their portrayal here.",literal
"Rapid Decline with season 4 Wow, season 1 and 2 I enjoyed very much. For me I've seen a bit of a decline with Season 3. By decline I mean in the writing. Season 4 extremely disappointing. I only finished the season because I was invested.

Okay, I was going to stop with invested, but it said my review was too short. I really do not want to add another 300 characters knocking season 4 so, I've asked several other friends who enjoy this series and they all agreed with me. Season 4 just seemed fragmented and weird, rarely did I laugh.

For those who enjoy season 4, good for you.

You would think with the High Caliber talent and cameos they could have pulled it off. But I'm sorry It did not work for me.",literal
"This is Dreadfully Bad I cannot believe this show made it into production. The creators of this mess need to stop abusing the public. This is easily one of the worst ""sitcoms"" I have seen in decades.

There is a reason no Sitcoms in the past have been based in a DMV office - it is one of the least plesant environments on the planet. The ensamble cast is clearly out of their depth,when it comes to comedy... or acting in general.

This program is just painful to sit through - though I doubt many people will endure a whole episode.

Do yourself a favor just PASS on this stinker. You will thank me later.",literal
"They want to steal mi gold! But I'm an inglorious (and indestructible) Sisu from Finland! There aren't many directors that I monitor closely, waiting and hoping for their next film to come out as soon as possible, but Jalmari Helander is one guy I keep track off. His long-feature debut ""Rare Exports"" was one of the most uniquely original and pleasantly deranged horror tales of the new century, and even his somewhat commercialized breakthrough ""Big Game"" (starring Samuel L. Jackson as the US President crashing with Air Force One in the Finnish woods) was a lot better and more entertaining than you'd think as well.

It took Helander nearly 8 years to return with a new film. At the Brussels' International Film Festival, where ""Sisu"" premiered and Helander was a guest of honor, he explained that he spent several years working on a personal dream project of his, but unfortunately it got cancelled entirely due to Covid. Out of pure frustration, or so he says, Helander wrote the script for ""Sisu"" in barely a couple of weeks. Well, if this near-brilliant explosion of action and sheer adrenalin is what he comes up with in a few weeks, then I sincerely hope he'll still get the chance to finish his other project.

What a film! You know those movies where all the great highlights and action-packed moments already feature in the trailer? ""Sisu"" has a terrific trailer too, but there are still a few hundreds of other highlights left to discover in the film. In fact, this film is a one-and-a-half-hour trailer full of awesome moments. The comparisons I've read between ""Sisu"" and Quentin Tarantino's ""Inglourious Bastards"" are accurate. The extreme violence and narrative structure are identical, and both films feature lots and lots of Nazis getting killed. Everybody just loves watching Nazis getting butchered in the utmost brutal and sadistic ways, is it not?

Aatami Korpi is a lone hermit digging for gold in the most northern region of Finland during the last months of WWII. When he hits the jackpot, he loads up his bag with pure gold and hopes to keep a low profile while heading back to civilization. When a platoon of Nazis finds out what he's carrying, though, they obviously want to steal it. But Korpi is not just a weak and defenseless recluse, or what did you expect? He's a force so determined and indestructible that only an obscure and local Finnish term for him exists.

Evidently (and also similar to ""Inglourious Bastards""), ""Sisu"" requires quite some suspension of disbelief from the audience. This man has the fighting and survival skills of John Rambo, but in combination with the indestructability of a T-1000 Terminator! Whether shot at with heavy artillery or a rope, he cannot die. He remains under water for a ridiculously long time and walks away from plane crashes totally unharmed. Is it plausible? Nope. Is it entertaining? You bet! Especially when watching in a chock-full festival theater with a thousand of outrageous horror fanatics shouting at a screen. Must-see!",figurative
Slow Horses Excellent- vibrant funny & authentic- it is the humour and fantastic scripts that beguile. Brilliant acting and fast paced story lines compelling- intrigue and naturalistic performances engage and it's the most interesting and entertaining view of spy world I have ever seen. We are all familiar with the glamorised world of James Bond - the gritty realism of Horses... is what I as an audience member keep coming back to. More please ! Thank You Gary Oldman you have imbued your character with humanity even though he superficially appears to be deeply cynical and weather warn - he also manages to convey a very humane and believable character.,literal

"Fold your laundry and have this on in the background. Yes, the lead character is trans. It's not problem. The writing falls short, the plot is okay, the cinematography is good. But the onslaught tidal wave of Netflix content that simply must check a box of having ""diversity"" seems to take priority over something that is SO watchable and good. The goal is now VIEWS not creative storytelling that is WORTHWHILE. No one is out here on Netflix trying to win an award -- they all just want click thrus and views and impressions for their numbers.

"Couldn't watch it Do yourself a favor and watch the original series with Adam Beach and Wes Studi instead. Those mysteries are faithful to Tony Hillerman's books.

The books were best sellers. The characters were great. You got a real feel for the Four Corners area; I've been there. I started episode one of this.

They have a guy fall into a mud puddle - in the desert. No rain, no stream or river, just a man-sized patch in the front yard. Jim Chee is portrayed as a punk, which isn't how he is in the books. That's when I closed the Amazon app and watched cats on YouTube instead.",literal
"Why is Vin Diesel a star? I am at a loss as to why Vin Diesel is considered something special. Sure, he was fine providing a voice for the underrated animated movie ""The Iron Giant"", but in live action he isn't anything like what I would consider a leading man. Here, as in his other movies, he comes across as as an arrogant and somewhat dumb thug that repulses you. Even Stallone at his worst still gave his character enough believability that you could accept his actions.

 As for the rest of the movie... well, it was meant to be an update of the James Bond movies, but they only got the words, not the music. Sure there's an evil organization out to hurt the world, but it and its members are given paper-thin development and no personality. Sure, there are high-tech gadgets, but they are TOO cartoony, and are presented in a way that doesn't amaze or make you think they're cool. Sure, there are foreign locations, but they are shoved so way in the background that you wonder why they bothered to go on location. Sure, there are big and elaborate stunt sequences, but they managed to be directed and edited in a way that saps out ALL the excitement other directors and editors would have been able to keep in. I'm sure some other wag in these user comments has already said this... but this is more ""ZZZ"" than ""XXX"".",literal

Why do they always have to make young boys so effeminate in these movies.",literal
"So, What,s Next? Maybe ""LAW & Order: Traffic & Parking Control."" Creating a successful Crime/Police/Drama is a hard task. To take your already successful series, such as ""LAW & ORDER""(0000), give the fundamental premise, look at it from a different point of view and bring us something new and different, yet somehow familiar, you're in again! In this case, we have an example of the highly successful ""other"" series, ""LAW & ORDER: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT."" Known as ""SVU"" for short, this spin-off hit the ground running back in 1999, and has been toward the front of the pack ever since. ""SVU"" has the same look of its forerunner, what with the same type of Police Buildings and Court Rooms used. The Court Exteriors, with the seemingly endless flight of cement stairs to climb, use to discuss cases or to face up to the Cameras and Microphones of the ""Gentlemen"" of the Electronic Media.

The shows all feature the functions and work of the Prosecutors, as well as that of the Detectives. As far as the basic overall blueprint for an individual Episode, here is where the two related series diverge.

Whereas ""SVU"" does dramatize the Court Room and the ""trials and tribulations of the Assistant District Attorney is generally a little less of the screen time as the approximately half time taken up by the ""Suits""in the progenitor, ""LAW & ORDER"".

""SYU"" also does get more into the personal lives of the regular characters in each story than does ""LAW & ORDER"". What with Olivia's(Miss Hargitay)longing to find the true identity of her Father.(She is the product of Her Mother's Rape!) And we have Fin's (Ice-T) getting personally involved with certain Victims. Also, we have the problem's of Det. Elliot Stabler (Christopher Maloni), who is the family man of the SVU Detective Squad. He simultaneously struggles with raising his kids right, and seeing all of the sexual promiscuity and abuse of the youths by perverted offenders.

In the category of re-cycled parts, we have two(2). First of all there is Dann Florek as Captain Don Cragin, formerly boss of the Detectives on ""LAW & ORDER"", but was resurrected after a couple seasons hiatus, only this time to head up the Special Vics'Unit.Then of course there is Detective John Munch (Richard Belzer), formerly with the Homicide Unit of the Baltimore Police Department. This inclusion of Munch, from ""HOMICIDE: Life on the Street""(1993-99), was a natural as there had been several ""crossovers""* involving the two series over the years.

In conclusion, this ""LAW & ORDER"" spin off has managed to be just enough like the original, yet having the innate ability to be just a little different.",literal
"Show like this only comes once in a lifetime ""Supernatural"" stands as a monumental achievement in television history, masterfully blending elements of horror, drama, and mythology into a cohesive and captivating narrative. Over its 15-season run, the show carved out a unique niche in the TV landscape, weaving an intricate tapestry of complex characters, imaginative storytelling, and profound emotional depth.

At the heart of ""Supernatural"" is the dynamic between brothers Sam and Dean Winchester, portrayed with remarkable chemistry by Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles. Their journey from small-town hunters to cosmic saviors is not only a thrilling ride through supernatural lore but also a poignant exploration of family bonds, personal growth, and sacrifice. The show's ability to balance these deep, personal themes with larger-than-life supernatural conflicts is a testament to its exceptional writing and character development.",figurative
"Makes me happy This show is about a couple that inherits a haunted estate. The woman has a head injury which leads to her being able to see and communicate with the ghosts. We follow the couple and the ghosts and how they go about their daily ""lives"". The show is really charming, funny and very warm. Watching it just makes me happy. I love the different characters and their stories and the actors play their parts perfectly. Set in a Downton abbey kind of environment adds to the cosy feeling. This show is so loveable that I forgive the sometimes silly jokes. Every episode is like praline in a chocolate box. Love it!",literal
"Love PTA, but this is overhyped People are calling this film Anderson's masterpiece. I can't agree. It's watchable and even good, but it would benefit from some serious editing as the last half really begins to drag. Pro Tip: The big chase scene in a feature film shouldn't drag! Over-the-top characters are so plentiful that it's almost a relief when one isn't (I would have loved to have seen more of Benicio Del Toro's sensei!). I'm not sure how this can be called PTA's masterpiece when it really doesn't stand up to films like There Will Be Blood, Phantom Thread, and Magnolia). Those films, too, have plenty of over-the-top characters, but their stories are just more compelling.",figurative
"A Watchable Adventure Throwback with ScarJo and Dinosaurs Another Jurassic World movie made in the never-ending search for great box office returns in Hollywood. But in all seriousness, there's still some fun to be had in a middling sequel-especially one I enjoyed more than the last two bloated entries in the franchise. Jurassic World: Rebirth returns to the more minimalist roots of the original film, being a course correction dealing with the theme of man-playing-as-God. Does it need to be a Jurassic Park movie? Not really. But it works as a throwback to more old-school adventure thrillers that don't try to outdo themselves with every set piece.

Gareth Edwards takes the director's chair, and I've long been a fan of his. He explored the theme of man vs. Monster with his low-budget debut Monsters, followed by the 2014 Godzilla reboot (which I also liked), and Rogue One, one of Disney's best Star Wars films. His ""less is more"" approach to monsters feels Spielbergian, emphasizing grounded human stories over nonstop spectacle. Of all the movies he's done so far, this is probably his least grounded, at least by comparison to the others. Even in The Creator, which I liked despite its flaws, he stayed true to that philosophy. Ironically, this might be his least grounded film to date. And unlike his usual style, he doesn't save the best action for a big third-act payoff. Still, he keeps us on edge with some Hitchcockian and creature-feature thrills, and there's nothing too intense for kids tagging along to see CGI dinosaurs.

The plot picks up after the events of Dominion. Dinosaurs, genetically engineered and poorly adapted to modern ecosystems, have been globally confined to the equatorial regions. A pharmaceutical company sees an opportunity to harvest their cells for a potential breakthrough treatment for heart disease. Enter Zora (Scarlett Johansson), a mercenary who assembles a team to track down three prehistoric creatures-technically one dinosaur and two other reptiles-for a big payday.

The dinosaurs in this film are set on an island where InGen crossbreeds and mutates them into Frankenstein-like abominations, but never bother using them in the Jurassic World amusement park. It's funny how InGen pours billions into these genetic hybrids but doesn't even enforce basic safety-like stopping an employee from eating a Snickers bar in a lab full of workers in hazmat suits. That's how the movie opens.

There's a little Baby Yoda-like dinosaur for the little girl character of this story. Oh yes. There's another group of unlucky tourists in plotline B: a family-a father, his two daughters, and a boyfriend. It's obvious this part is meant to appeal to family moviegoers.

Most characters are thinly written. Even those given a backstory-like Johansson and Mahershala Ali-don't quite land emotionally satisfying arcs. I could predict almost every character death from the outset, though one survivor surprised me. Johansson's chemistry with Jonathan Bailey is a highlight, but both are still underwritten, which holds the film back from being as fun as Jurassic Park III or the first Jurassic World. (And needless to say, it doesn't hold a candle to the original.)

One standout is the T-Rex river raft sequence-an exciting set piece inspired by Michael Crichton's original novel and once planned for Spielberg's first film. It's a thrilling moment that puts the child characters in danger without becoming too intense.

It's a competently made, decent adventure film to pass the time as a family matinee. No groundbreaking ideas or visuals here-just enough dinosaur mayhem to justify its existence. At least until the next resurrection. Oh, how we wish the people in Jurassic World would finally learn.

My rating: 6/10.",figurative
"One of the worst movies I have ever seen Ridiculous plot, boring, hollow and hard to watch. Not a moment of pleasure in the whole movie except maybe that the end is so silly that my wife and I laughed out loud. Even the score/music was bad.

"The new «Lost» This is going to be the new «Lost», and I mean that in a negative way. Just Like Lost, it had a great start, but it also just keeps throwing new weird, mysterious things at us that never is explained.

The first season started weird, but I stuck with it because of all the positive reviews I've heard. And finally, the last two episodes were great, finally something happened and it seemed great.

Season 2 started slow, but I kinda anticipated that. So I stuck with it and hoped things will be explained and that it would pick up pace. But episode 7,8 and 9 is just so slow and stupid, this should have been one episode. And the last episode doesn't explain much at all, new weird things still come that are not explained, and it just ruined the whole show.

Don't waste your time on this as I have done.",literal
Capturing time on film. I thought The Sandlot captured the innocence and joy of being young and playing baseball in a small town neighborhood. The film isn't perfect but has great atmosphere. I enjoyed the sub-plot with the dog and James Earl Jones and I loved the scenes when the kids were just being kids and enjoying the summer. The film made me feel good and I sometimes think that's all a film is supposed to do. Check it out.,literal
"Grey's fan since 2005 I've been watching this show since it started 2005. Those were the days when you couldn't stream any episodes. You had to wait for the episodes to air on tv every week.

I have rewatched the show many times as well. But to be honest season 1-11 are the best seasons.

There were so many amazing couples to cheer on. Great storylines for the doctors and patients.

As a OG MerDer fan there's many iconic scenes which I will never forget til this day.

But after Derek's death it just felt so forced to continue. I wish they would have ended the show at season 12.

So my advice, watch s1-11 over and over.",literal
"Insanely good This film is absolutely amazing. I was captivated by everything and the acting was top notch. Russell Crowes best acting in a long time. Hes always been one of my favorites since the gladiator and I was proud of him in this role.

"Watch this for Evan Peters. Finished watching this series last night, I will say I did enjoy it even though as some reviewers have said the truth was stretched a bit but of course that doesn't come as a shock because this is a series and they do spread certain scenes out for dramas purposes.

The episodes seems to go fast when you were watching, especially when Evan Peters was on screen as Dahmer, he was brilliant.

I am still at a loss as why some have said they had to turn it off because it was bleak, of course it is. This series is about a serial killer.

Overall a very well done drama series, it's not as gory as your led to believe.",literal

Just settle down and enjoy it!

The jokes are tiresome the routines been done there's no heart it's tired jokes and actors who are going through the motions.

This would have worked, single grainy shakey camera and really good newcomers you cant compare to anyone else!

And then there's the loud, bombastic, pulse- pounding, old-school soundtrack. That's in case you don't realize from all the drawn guns, crouching and carrying- on that they're closing in on the kill.

Never fear, though, they'll carry out the kill Seriously and Earnestly. Because they do everything Seriously and Earnestly. The show probably fines them for gratuitous smiling.

"Ruined by wife and daughter Glad to see other reviews here with similar views, there is hope for humanity. Remove the daughter and wife characters from the story and the show instantly gets much better. These characters are brainrot, the daughter especially is terrible. I managed to reach episode 7 without skipping their scenes but that was my limit, they bring down each episode. What is point of their involvement? Surely only a small number of viewers enjoy their pathetic scenes, the sexualisation of both characters is quite sick and a massive backwards step for the writers.

"Tracker is classic television Tracker is an enjoyable show to watch in the mold of a classic tv show you might have found in the 80s.

The rescue of the week is engaging and Colter's team is thoughtfully put together. A recent episode saw Jensen Ackles play Colter's brother and there were parallels between Ackles's Dean Winchester and this new character. In some non-supernatural way, the two shows have similarities: constantly on the road, a tough upbringing by a demanding and unconventional father, caring for strangers to save their lives...",literal
"I loved this show! I just finished watching the entire series and have to say I was pulled in from the start and found the show to be incredibly delightful in so many different ways. One minute you're laughing your ass off and the next moment you're fighting back the tears. The character development is phenomenal and the show is so well written as it portrays all sides of life: funny, sad, messy, awkward, raunchy and heart wrenching. Laura Linney's character and her brother were the anchors of the show, they both brilliantly acted their parts and had a strong unbreakable bond you don't fully recognize until the end of the series. It melts your heart. I loved the mix of characters over the course of the series, every character had relevance and depth. I honestly don't have a single bad thing to say about the show. Brilliant!",figurative
"Great show This show is very entertaining, plot is also very good, acting is amazing. I love the development between characters and the way they interact. This show adds a bit of everything to the show as for examples action, bit of horror, comedy, thriller aspects. Show it keeps u engaged the whole time. Great show.",literal
"I love Rachel Sennett! It's unfortunate this got so much hate it's pretty good although love the trailer song wish that was part of the series. Great cast nice to see Odessa Azion not in horror, she was awesome in new Hellraizer and Until Dawn film. This deserves more than 5.7 rating but I guess it's fair maybe overtime it'll change, to me it's great!",literal
"FINALLY IS BACK!!!! The White Lotus is back, and the Season 3 premiere is an absolute masterpiece! Set in breathtaking Thailand, the episode immediately pulls you in with its signature mix of dark humor, sharp social satire, and an undercurrent of mystery that keeps you on edge. The new cast is phenomenal-Parker Posey and Jason Isaacs are scene-stealers, but every actor delivers compelling, layered performances. The writing is razor-sharp, balancing biting commentary with moments of pure brilliance. The story is already unfolding with intrigue, unexpected twists, and the kind of tension that makes this show so addictive. Mike White has done it again-this season is going to be unforgettable!",figurative

"Superman has personality again! I throughly enjoyed this movie. As much as I liked Henry Cavill as Superman, I David Corenswet just brings such a joyful, real boy scout energy to screen.

I thought I was going to hate Superdog, but I didn't and Clark's exasperation with Krypto was so funny. Can't have him kill his parent's cows.

Rachel Brosnahan is a great Lois Lane. Loved that Superman never had to rescue her, she and David have fantastic chemistry.

Nicholas Hoult ... I'm sorry I ever doubted you as Lex.

Mr Terrific! Wooooo!! He is Mr Terrific.

I see a lot people complaining that it didnt feel like a Superman movie, but I disagree. It actually felt like he was a real part of the world.

Sure, there's a lot of cheesiness, but it was a lot of fun.

I liked that they brought back Ma & Pa as an older couple, they were adorable Was it perfect? No.

A lot of supporting characters felt underdeveloped, the pacing was off and the war really felt manufactured, which I suppose was the point. But it did look like a soundstage.

Rewatching it made me smile and enjoy it all over again, catching things i missed first time around.

Sometimes we just need a fun, hopeful movie.",literal
"Absurd Remember that commercial 'kids...this is drugs - (breaks egg into frying pan) this is your brain on drugs!

First thing that came to mind watching this.

Terrible acting The plot is ridiculous There is no story Overlooked sensibility!

"Time to let it go I used to like this series...alot. But all good things must come to an end. Season 17 is really, really bad.

"Has lost its spark This show was immaculate, the first seasons were pure gold they were funny and the drama was no more than good but I think through the years it has lost its spark some characters have lost they're essence and I really have to say I just keep watching the show because of the love I have to it but it's just really not the same... they just try to replace things or characters that are irreplaceable I wish we could get a great end but I hope it's with the old characters cause if it's with this new ones it's just going to be disappointing...",literal
"How much do you value consciousness The concept of Severance in itself is more than enough to make anyone interested in watching. But executing that idea - especially one this complex is a difficult task that so far has been brought to fruition in a near perfect way.

This show really makes you ponder on what you think about work life, life itself and the way you perceive living. In Severance, the idea of creating a new consciousness within oneself and having to live with the fact that you'll potentially never know how that other side feels or what it's going through is a thought that goes through the minds of many characters, but the best part about the show is slowly watching the plot unravel as these characters go further and further down this abyss of what they were born into, or in another sense put their other selves into.

In certain instances it's a hilarious comedy that'll remind you of The Office, but simultaneously is similar to Lost and Attack On Titan with the way it floods you with bizarre questions that are so odd yet specific that you can only wonder what's going to unfold out of it all. The spear heading of Dan Erickson's genius concept, Ben Stiller's great direction as well as the fantastic acting have made Severance a must watch show with it's first season being by far one of the best in tv history, with the 2nd season so far showing no signs of decline.",literal
"Real life issues with intelligent and funny humor and amazing acting. My favorite thing about Shamless is the writing. You can tell the writers did their homework on what Southside Chicago life can look like. Phenomenal storytelling along with extremely talented actors creates 11 seasons worth binging. The character development, diverse and intersectional characters with personal and realistic plotlines is what makes this show legendary. The growth the cast goes through together over the years brings connection to the characters is on another level. Substance abuse, mental health struggles, addiction, poverty, generational trauma and the heart of family beautifully and authentically represented.",literal
"First six episodes... Halfway through season one and I have developed an unexpected fondness for this dry, subtle and somewhat dark medical drama. 

The show is centred around tough and candid Nurse Jackie who juggles her work, boyfriend, husband and kids all whilst dealing with her secret addiction to pain killers.

Nurse Jackie moves away from the typical soap opera territory where many hospital based dramas reside and in so, does not rely on outrageous medical situations nor heroic, attractive doctors to capture its viewers. 

The true triumph of Nurse Jackie is its intriguing characters and outstanding acting, without exception, from the cast. 

Edie Falco portrays every dimension of her character with real conviction. Despite Jackie's complicated domestic life and obvious addiction, she is a surprisingly stable and strong character. Just six episodes in and I'm gripped by her story.

Alongside Falco, Merritt Weaver plays enthusiastic nursing student Zoe. Impressionable and talkative, Zoe renders a perfect counterpart to Jackie and has provided some of the shows funniest moments. Eva Best plays Jackie's best friend and eccentric British Doctor Eleanor O'Hara. Much like Jackie, O'Hara is contempt and bitter yet instantly likable. Another great performance comes from Peter Facinelli who plays Fitch Cooper, a new doctor who is confident and smug despite his inappropriate groping impulse.

Whilst I am a big fan of the beautiful doctor love-fest that is Grey's Anatomy and the laugh-a-minute cry-a-minute comedy drama Scrubs, Nurse Jackie (so far) is a refreshing change of pace from typical medical dramas. The show is dark yet hilarious with outlandish yet realistic characters. The episodes are well measured in their half-hour slot, each with individual and on-going stories. 

Nurse Jackie maybe lacklustre for fans of hard-hitting, edge-of-seat dramas, however the show is smart and gritty and certainly has potential.",literal
"Even David couldn't save this movie. I watched the first episode. It was okay. The villain guy was sleazy and had no appeal as a character to be considered likable. When he told that girl he was tutoring that he would like to gut and hang her up, it should have been a red flag for anyone.

Lastly, animal cruelty should never be entertainment. Pass.",literal
"Funnier than it is scary Somehow funnier than it is scary, but pretty entertaining nonetheless. First half could've been trimmed down a bit to speed it up, and the perspective switches killed the momentum a bit. But the last half is pretty fun, and the cast gave great performances. The villain balances the line well between quirky and evil (8.2/10)",literal
"Good action in 18th century France Recap: In the province of Gévaudan, France, there is a beast attacking the villagers. Childs and women disappear, just to turn up dead and partly eaten days later. The king himself takes an interest and dispatches Gregorie de Fronsac, a soldier and biologist, to take part in the massive hunt. But Fronsac also finds interest in the daughter of a nobleman, and soon there is much more going on than a simple hunt.

Comments: I had expected a story with far more fantasy in it. A journey taken, a mission to be accomplished. Something like that. This is set in historical France and actually is (loosely) based upon a real story. No journey, no mission in that sense. But I wasn't disappointed.

Instead the story is built around two very likable characters, Fronsac and Mani. An odd element in the French aristocracy they really shake things up. Both of them are experienced warriors and put up some serious fighting whenever they get the chance.

No ordinary costume drama, even if there are plenty of costumes around. Apart from the action though, it is mostly a mystery or thriller. Fronsac plays the part of the detective trying to solve these murders, only that it is set in the 18th century France.

And it is good. Not too hard to suspect whom the villains are, but easy to stay interested in to see all the details. And enjoy the action scenes. Only some special effects are a little poor...

Also an interesting cast. Vincent Cassel rarely gives a poor performance but have a more or less supporting role here. But neither Samuel Le Bihan nor Mark Dacascos disappoint so there is nor problem there.

"The Beast of Gevaudin couldn't convince me of its bad intentions. I've seen the English dubbed version and I liked it, but I'm convinced that it would have been a lot better in French. I know many of you, especially the English speaking people, prefer this version, because they are not used to subtitles and they don't speak French. Still I think it is better to see the original movie. It just feels more natural, which I certainly prefer.

What I liked about this movie was the story. In Europe every region probably has its own legends and it is nice to see one of them appear in a movie. Le pacte des loups or The Brotherhood of the Wolf tells the story, which is partially based on true events, of the Beast of Gevaudin that lived and killed in the mountains of Southern France in 1764, and of the people who were sent to hunt it down. As these hunters get closer to it, they find out the truth behind this beast that prays on innocent children and women...

The cinematography is really breath taking, the actors did an excellent job and most of the time the fight scenes are nice to watch and yet the movie didn't blow me away. Everything was fine until I saw the ""Beast"". Why did the director have to make it the way it looked? (no, I'm not going to tell you how it looks, you'll have to find it out for yourself) Why did he show it in the first place? I mean, wouldn't the suspense have been a lot bigger if he kept us waiting to see a glimpse of it? 

For me, the movie lost a lot of it's credibility and charm when I actually saw the 'Beast', which is really too bad. I guess I would have rewarded it with at least an 8 if I hadn't seen the ""Beast of Gevaudin"" crawling around in those beautiful landscapes, now a 7 will be more than enough.",literal
"Insanely amazing and quite touching One-Punch Man is mixture of comedy, action, and duty. I won't get into the details of the series in order to not generate any spoilers but I highly recommend it. The animation is BEYOND exquisite with very 'understandable bad guys''. It is a must watch. Also note that it has a LOT of graphic violence, so I don't think any random kid can should watch it as it could affect their thinking. But I must admit that there are few shows that could depict the honors of both duty and sacrifice as well the series. If you do have the free time, I suggest that you watch it. It is highly inspirational and just really worthwhile to watch. And not to forget the wonderful nature of the characters. From what I've watched, I don't believe that it has a 'copy-and-paste' character design method. Each character, even sub ones at that, all seem to be present for a particular purpose and not just used as a stepping stone for another one but each have their own individual story and struggles that anyone can easily relate well with. It is truly both an eye-catcher and a heart-catcher. And I honestly say that I am so happy to see it at the top of this list as I sincerely believe that it deserves this position. 😊",figurative
"James bond meets the X-games... By Greg Ursic

Mention the word ""spy"" and for most people it conjures up British accents, tuxedos and martinis  shaken, not stirred of course. While I've been a Bond fan for longer than I care to admit, let's be realistic for a moment; it's pretty hard to relate to a polished pseudo aristocrat who beds supermodels, battles supervillains and saves the world on a weekly basis. Where are all the regular Joe average superspies?

Xander Cage is an attitude riddled adrenalin junkie who is always looking for the next big fix. His fun comes to an abrupt stop when his latest stunt catches the attention of the wrong person in the NSA and Xander gets shanghaied. It seems that a certain anarchist group, composed of earthy ex-Red Army regulars is intent on ushering in a new era, and suave, sophisticated spies stick out like, well, suave sophisticated spies. The NSA feels that this is a task that Xander, a tattooed delinquent, deemed to be the `best and brightest of the bottom of the barrel' would be perfect for. Well, with a few exceptions.

With Schwarzenegger contemplating a run for Governor, and Willis finally being accepted as a `serious' actor, the Action Hero genre has been left bereft of a genuine successor. Enter Vin Diesel, a man of few words, who first popped up on Hollywood's radar when his indie film `Multi-facial', which he wrote, directed and starred in received great reviews at Caanes. Most importantly, Diesel caught the attention of Steven Spielberg, who cast him in `Saving Private Ryan' as Private Caparzo. His breakout role as Dominic Toretto in `The Fast and the Furious' (a film intended to showcase Paul Walker) proved his power as a box office draw and he was soon being hailed as the go to action hero for the next millennia (Revolution Studios is betting huge that he will be- they signed him to a three picture deal and will pay him $20 million for the first sequel).

As Xander, Diesel is surprisingly low key  he is pensive, humorous, growly and explosive when necessary - and there is no doubt that `XXX' is his vehicle. Diesel dominates every scene that he appears in with an understated cockiness, and those ever-bulging biceps. Asia Argento (daughter of horror meister Dario Argento) affects a Courtenay Love style persona  her Yelena is tough, b*tchy, no nonsense and cold as ice. Yelena, like Xander, is edgy, rough, and quick-witted. The supporting cast, with the exception of Samuel Jackson as Xander's slick and slimy protégé, are largely unremarkable.

 The action sequences are for lack of a better word, extreme: from the opening base jump (okay, technically it's not a base jump in the strictest sense of the term) with a twist sequence, to the amazing freestyle motocross sequence to the boarding, the stunts are amazing. I also appreciated the fact that neither the spies or the gadgets have much polish  the Q equivalent in `XXX' is a total geek/frat boy wannabe whose gadgets lack subtlety, and are largely untested (XXX's retrofitted GTO requires a `Gadgets for Dummies' guide). There are several elements that hamstring the film however.

The actors are constantly hemmed in by lackluster dialogue  it doesn't matter how charismatic a character is, they are ultimately defined by their writing. There were no pithy catch phrases or witticisms  a necessity for any action hero. There are also too many lulls in the film  I appreciated the action sequences but repeatedly found myself getting bored with the filler in between. Also, the `secret' plot elements were far too obvious and easily divined. Finally, I was largely unimpressed with the FX used in several sequences (especially the avalanche).

If you are looking to give the old gray matter and inject some excitement into your weekend, splurge on a matinee.",figurative
"Actually lowered my score having to fight the tide of overly generous high ratings, even reviews saying it's a disaster score it 7/10, WTH?!? Hello again film fans, I hope you are all well. Soooo I've been thinking about writing this review for a few days now since excitedly rushing to the cinema with expectations as big as Arnold's biceps to be blown away by the masterful genius Edgar Wright's vision and take on the Stephen King popular story The Running Man!!! As an 80s kid I naturally grew up on Arnold, Stallone, Van Damme, etc when action icons ruled the world! Ahhhh the good ol days! But the Running man was and still is one of my favourite Schwarzenegger movies, it's a perfect example of the 80s movies that made him so popular. Great story, great characters, great action and most importantly GREAT pacing! The film FLIES through its runtime, never letting the audience get bored for a second! Now before you all assume I'm just a fanboy of the original and not giving this remake/reimaging a fair chance, hold your horses, everything deserves a chance to prove itself and i personally was excited to see this new take as I owned the book when younger also so I was fully aware of the direction they were going in. Plus NO ONE can fill Arnold's running boots so if you were going into this 2025 version expecting a rehash of the 80s classic then you would INSTANTLY dislike it. But as a life long film fan and writer/filmmaker myself, my mindset going to this was ""Directed by Edgar Wright, one of my Favourite filmmakers since Spaced! Glen Powell, looking to win me over as a new fan of his as he has done good before and he looks great in the trailers, Josh Brosephlin the legend as Killian the hated running man bad guy??!! AND it's one of my favourite storylines from the great Stephen king! My only concern was that it would be a 12, but no it's certificate 15 so I was hoping to see some extreme action/violence as the story alone has PLENTY! In other words, as a filmmaker and film buff I was WELL EXCITED!! The Running man but with the frenetic energy and pacing of Hot Fuzz and Scott Pilgrim, with a great cast, in a world where ANYONE can kill Ben Richards and claim a cash prize???!! LETS GO!!!!!!

Sadly you see what I've scored the film, so you know it did NOT deliver ANYTHING of what I was hoping. Side note tho I did originally rate it 3/10 just for effort(as expected the film looks great) but seeing all these misleading scores and reviews I've had to try to balance out the misleading 6.8 suggesting this is anything more than a VERY forgettable, run of the mill, seen it all done before and better movie. Even writing that last sentence breaks my heart!!! This had EVERYTHING going for it to be Edgar Wright's BEST FILM!!! So the film itself, it starts of all good and sets it all up nicely, but when he actually starts running, it's all just very MEH! Everything that's supposed to be exciting and original turns out bland and boring and cliche! NONE of the action is inspired apart from one shot where the camera follows him running down a hallway but youve seen that shot in the trailer anyway! The writing itself? Written by the two guys who wrote Scott Pilgrim? I simply don't believe it was!! The script is SO bland and uninspired! None of Edgar Wright's wit, timing or skill is present! The humour itself? Embarrassingly UNFUNNY! I honestly can't remember the last time I rolled my eyes so much at lame forced humour! But the biggest crime of this HUGE disappointment? You don't actually care about ANY of the characters! The good guys? Nope. The bad guys? Nope! The film is so run of the mill and bland youre not actually invested in anything or anyone! Ben Richard's in this version is SO OVER THE TOP ANGRY he'd make the hulk look like a pacifist! And worse yet, you don't really feel his anger is really warranted, he just comes across as a bit unhinged and mental! Yea maybe 12 year olds think that's a cool characteristic, but I'm older and more mature than that. The reason John Wick works is because of how cool he is with his rage, Ben Richard's just punches anyone he doesn't like the look of! But yet we are also supposed to buy into that he's a big hearted, caring guy....when he's not smashing, punching, kicking, biting, shooting, destroying LITERALLY EVERYTHING else around him. Yea, bad writing right there I'm afraid. I'm honestly still in shock this was written and directed by half the team of the BRILLIANTLY written and directed cornetto trilogy! Then there's the pacing? All over the place! But not in the good way that thrills you, more in the way that you can't find your feet so you're not sure what's supposed to be exciting or what's supposed to be dramatic. If im ranting it's because I still can't believe what a misfire and disappointment this actually turned out to be! And now for the biggest shock slap in the face this film gave me.... THAT ENDING!!!

For those who haven't yet watched the film and don't want the ending ruined(even tho the film makers do that themselves!) I'd advise you to stop reading now, and thank you for your time. For those who don't care or have seen it, I sure hope this RIDICULOUSLY AWFUL ending did something for you as all it did was make me as angry as Ben Richard's himself! So our hero is all alone on a jetplane, LOCKED on said jetplane, a jet plane that the bad guys have proven they can take control of WHENEVER they want to and have already, and the last thing we see is the bad guys blow up the jet. Then somehow Ben Richards survived, escaped, gained access to the bad guys SECURITY building UNNOTICED and kills the bad guy. I mean maybe I'd already lost my attention to detail and missed something as I'd honestly spent the last hour and some just wishing the film would hurry up and end, but it does strike me as one of the worst endings ever!

So to wrap it up this film is the biggest disappointment since Avengers Endgame, SO MUCH potential yet the finished product just leaves you angry and confused over how it all went so wrong. Go into it with ZERO expectations and I dunno, maybe you'll enjoy it? Last thing tho, Congratulations to Josh Brosephlin tho who no doubt earned his easiest pay check yet, he just talks into screen for most his screen time, he could've just filmed it at home! Nice one Brolin you legend! I'm bored of ranting now, thank you for listening/reading, and until the next time stay safe, and may the force be with you.",figurative
"A Must See I watched a lot of television, and this is the best show on TV!

Excellent cast. writing and direction. Engaging, thoughtful and entertaining, every moment of each episode. More happens within the first 30 minutes of this program than a full hour of most other programs. 

William Macy is at his very, very best and Ms. Rossum is a pure delight! If he wasn't a star before this, Jeremy Allen White is someone you better pay attention to because he is magic. 

But no one gives me more joy on this program than Ms. Joan Cusack. If she doesn't win an Emmy for her performance as the reclusive, bewildered and wacky Sheila Jackson then there's no justice in the world. Performances by Emma Kenney and Steve Howey are two more stars of this excellent ensemble enterprise that are not to be missed. 

This is appointment television at it's best and you know that because when each episode ends, it leaves you wanting more.",literal
"""A real pickle!"" Corny, old-fashioned fun about an awkward new kid in town who makes friends with the local yutes who play sandlot baseball. A likable cast of kids goes a long way to making thin material work.

It's lightweight fluff, but that's fine. Kids should like it most.",literal
"Big Steaming Pile of Canadian Drama Yet another Big Steaming Pile of Canadian TV. Makes you wonder why Canada is so bad. So very bad, that they always have to pretend it is tales place in the U. S. Nothing says cheaply produced like a production moved to CANADA. It is a shame that American actors and production staff are hurting for jobs while the Producer of this ""import"" does give a darn. I hope American advertisers take note!

This series has a ""been there done that"" sort of feel. It is a standard Police programmer like dozens of previous programs. Marina Baccatin is horribly miscast as the lead character. She never stops ""being dramatic"". And she is never ever convincing as a Law Enforcement Officer.

"Alaskan Bush People... In case you missed it television is the new cinema, with many big acting names and directors electing to take their talents onto the small screen instead of the (dying) movie theater. Case in point, this new 'Apple' big-budget 10-part action thriller set in Alaska.

The always dependable Jason Clarke (the sheriff) stars along with lovely Haley Bennett (FBI agent) and Dominic Cooper - and all three are good. Indeed the opening episode is excellent with lots of action, fast pacing, decent locations and lots of intriguing plot-lines with nice twists and turns throughout. While there are obvious rip-offs of 'Con Air', 'Rambo' and 'Seven' on show, the piece still holds its own and keeps you engaged and entertained.

There are a a couple of gripes however, like the superfluous son/girlfriend subplot and the somewhat questionable actions of Jason Clarkes nurse wife. It also has to be said that episode 2 is way off the pace and intrigue of the solid opener, which is a concern seeing as there are 10 episodes on the slate!

Admittedly this makes me somewhat dubious about the show moving forward, but for now i'll see where this goes... hopefully the Raneys, Browns or KIlchers don't show up and ruin it all though! ;-P

**Update - by episode 5 thngs start to lose momentum and focus. As feared it's turning into a long-winded bust... a solid 3-part mini series woulda been way better!",literal
"Shockingly bad After hitting play on this, there was a long period of time where I thought I was accidentally watching a trailer. The editing and pacing were all over the place. Everything was hyper immediate and nothing was being introduced with any elegance or subtlety. Then I realised it wasn't a trailer, it was just some awful attempt at being modern, or unique. As if it was made purely for a TikTok generation. A perplexing choice since I imagine absolutely none of them would go near it. So anyone hoping for a sophisticated well made drama about an incredible history should go elsewhere. The most jarring bit is definitely the music. It's all contemporary and so out of kilter with the era that it's one of the worst decisions I've ever seen. Take the Fontaines track in Ep 1. That same song was also used in Black Rabbit (which although a slow burn, is ultimately very good). Against the backdrop of gritty New York, the Fontaines music works brilliantly. But then to hear it as the backdrop to 18th century Ireland, OMG, no. Just one example of awfulness. There are many. You get loads of stereotypes, Irish swilling down liquor from bottles, fighting and swearing. It's just crass and stupid on another level. Re-watch Succession and you'll have a better time. At least in that show the writing and characters are incredible, not like this disaster. One star is being generous. They had the money but glossed over so many interesting things and ruined it all.",literal
"Still trying to figure this one out I don't like writing reviews with spoilers, but I can't think of any way to review this without one, because the end is so integral to the whole, and you cannot reasonably review the beginning and middle, nor can you try to suss out the movie's meanings without the end. I will try to give away as little as possible, but if you don't want to know, please stop reading NOW.

This starts as a kind of mashup of deranged conspiracy theorist and kidnapper/prisoner story. You might wonder at some point if perhaps the prisoner (a fantastic Emma Stone) might go all Copenhagen and start sympathizing with her captor (a grungy, and calmly jittery Jessie Plemons). But she is steadfast in her sole desire to escape.

Plemons' character believes that Stone's character, one of the most powerful female executives in the world, is actually an alien sent to Earth from Andromeda for the purpose of extinguishing humans (though he never explains why they might do this). The bulk of the movie is Plemons questioning and torturing Stone, each trying different tactics to reach their individual ends. In the middle is Plemons' simple, probably autistic cousin, whom Plemons is constantly instructing, reining back into the mission at hand. The cousin is confused and guilt-ridden by all that he is witnessing and party to, to an eventual tragic end.

And in the end, Plemons' beliefs end up being true and come to fruition in both expected and unexpected ways.

So here's the thing. I'm unsure what the director is trying to say. I normally love his work (Poor Things is one of the best movies of the century so far, IMHO). And there are parts of this that reach for that brilliance. But I can't tell if he's trying to say that these seemingly deranged conspiracy theorists are right? Or they might be right? Or there may be a kernel of truth in what they rave about (this part feels correct, because most conspiracy theories do usually start with and contain a particle of truth or fact, and are then expanded, through the feedback loop of the Internet and 24 hour news cycles and partisan commentary presented as fact)? But this feels, to me, a dangerous message to put out there, namely that the theorists are correct and we, allegedly sane people, are the ones living in the feedback look, controlled by those the theorists are warning us about.

I ultimately left the theater disappointed. I had wanted to like this very much, loving the previous work by both the director and Stone (she should receive at least an Oscar nomination for this work). My husband loved it. I did not. And the ending was a complete bummer, and devastatingly depressing. The saving grace in the final moments is Stone, showing in her face both pain and compassion in executing her final act in the film.

Not for the squeamish, certainly. But it could give you some food for thought. I'm still puzzling this one out a week later..",literal

"Decent but ridiculous Jude Law is great. The story itself is silly and impractical. It is a slow burn at first but gets into a thriller based off more and more totally impractical scenarios. Jason Bateman plays the most illogical unrealistic persona of all time. If we are in the '80s or it is a post-apocalyptic scenario, sure, let's not call the cops and try and take on the deaf mafia guy head on. But here, what the hell are we doing? Sheer stupidity. Keeps getting more and more ridiculous. Acting overall is good, plus keeping viewers on edge of their seat. Just diminished by stupid plot. All the side characters act quite well too. It is just a letdown for Bateman's character and the silliness of the story that was written. Obviously they did not do any research into real criminal procedure like The Wire in writing this goofy plot.

Oh, also Bateman and Law were some cool indie band back in the day but no backstory on that aside from some brief maybe 2 minute music video in one of the episodes. Seemed like writers were like what if these brothers were like Oasis? For one second. Then didn't ever return to idea or elaborate on it. I know it's a ""thriller""(yeah yeah yeah) but if they made it more flight of the concords that'd be better, or at least include something more than a 2 minute random ass backstory on their ""popular band.""

Bateman's character was so unlikable overall yet they want us to feel something at the time of his incredibly dumb self-inflicted death? Upset this was so poorly written.

Only gets a 6/10 from me because the acting overall was good as well as cinematography and it is better than most shows put on these days, particularly on Netflix. Also shoutout to Jude Law's mistress bc she is a baddie.",literal
"Not for Hillerman purists It's more like a loving riff on the characters than an accurate representation, but Zahn McClarnon is perfect as Joe Leaphorn and Kiowa Gordon and Jessica Matten play Jim and Bernadette very well, even if they aren't exactly the characters from the books. Once I had entered the world as presented it became a gripping story, and a much better presentation of Hillerman's fiction than the previous outings with Fred Ward and Lou Diamond Phillips, and Wes Studi and Adam Beach, all of which I felt were underpowered. Well done all round and I look forward to further seasons.

When I was a lad someone pointed out the common mistake then of characters wearing glasses having plain glass lenses - you can see straight through when they are shown from an angle. It stuck with me and even decades later I watch for it. There's one character in this who is supposed to be wearing thick lenses, yet there in a final scene there's lots of half profile closeups and no distortion whatsoever. It kinda spoils the illusion! You'd think that film makers would have noted that by now but clearly not.",literal
"quite fun, although I understand the criticism A common criticism of popular culture is the depiction of Jewish women: they usually get depicted as shrews. Admittedly, ""Nobody Wants This"" has some of that, but overall it's a good show, with the focus on a romance between a rabbi (Adam Brody) and a gentile podcaster (Kristen Bell).

I guess that a frequent trope in popular culture is the WASP who hooks up with an ethnic person and is thereafter the bane of the ethnic person's family (or it could be an ethnic person becoming the bane of the WASP's family). Well, a lot of the depictions of people are realistic, and quite frankly I think that we need more depictions of intermarriage; after all, our country IS the melting pot.

I recommend it.",literal
"Gothic Horror is Back! First off, I love a modern gothic horror adaptation, this just made my list of Halloween yearly rewatches along with Nosteratu (2024). There's just something about the visuals of rain flooded cathedral rooftops and blood flowing down cobblestone streets that gives you a faint touch of anxiety that you'll catch the plague while sitting in your theater's recliner.

But I digress, Oscar Isaac is brilliant, no surprise there, from Drive to Ex Machina, his villain arc continues to grow like the hump on Igor's back. I look forward to his next role as usual.

I have to admit, having never seen Euphoria, I didn't know how Jacob Elordi would play out but the dude's got range! He really brought the character to life, killed it, then brought it back to life again.

Mia Goth, great mother of Pearl! I found myself falling in line behind all of the other characters in the film that fell in love with her. She never misses.

Christoph Waltz... need I say more?

Guillermo del Toro delivers once again! The visuals and storytelling kept me engaged, even when scenes would slow down, the emotion picked up. And this film is brutal! The creature does not hold back, he was put together to rip others apart.

Go to the theater to see this one while you can! Every shot is masterfully framed and the grandiose set pieces require eyes to be feasted upon the big screen.",literal
"Hot take I personally loved this season of Watson. Yes it reminded me of House M. D. but when I stopped trying to compare Watson to other shows I really started enjoying it. The cast is spectacular and I really enjoyed the storytelling. Watson has its own quirks and I really love them. I am rooting for more than 8 episodes this next season!! I'm excited to see where the writers go with the Moriarty/ Holmes side of the story. This show is great if you put aside comparison. Comparison is a thief of joy even in TV shows. I will definitely be putting Watson in my yearly rotation of TV shows. It was fun, witty, and enjoyable I can't wait to see more!

*Edit* The season ended with more episodes and it was a bit interesting at the end. The creativity the writers have is outstanding. I am now impatiently waiting for the next season.",literal
"My favorite show on television I am not usually into law all that much but this show is an exception. Each actor does an excellent job portraying their character and the show keeps me on the edge of my seat in every episode I watch.

Also, they do a excellent job at making the least suspected character that many don't think did the crime, the one who actually did do the crime.

They also do a good job at making the storyline for each episode. Instead of keeping the same old ones in every episode, they mix the story lines between rape, poison, kidnap, beating, child abuse etc. You just never know what the show is about until you watch it and that is what makes it so great. 

Overall, I give this excellent show a 10/10.",literal
"Disappointing. I really like the original Law & Order. I don't like this version. Why? I like Sam and Anthony. The rest of the cast you can keep. Especially, Jeffrey. Anthony needs a haircut and trim his beard. Too bad they didn't bring back Jeremy Sisto and Linus Roache. They were great.",literal

Season 17 is absolutely awful. This is supposed to be entertaining and enjoyable, taking ppls minds of the real world. Covid draging on and on and on. Really? And Alex leaving!! I am sorry but that is it for me. The show is over.",literal
"Modern-Day Magic That Needs Finessing O Dave Franco LIKES: Fun Adventurous Good Pacing Funny Stylish Clever Tricks Decent Character Development Balancing Of Characters The Music The Wit SUMMARY: What can I say? I have fun with these films as the stylish theatrics of magic are contorted into a crime element befitting of an Ocean's plot. The third installment captures much of the first film's charm, bringing plenty of stakes and wit to enjoy as you solve the overall arc of the parties. Much of the fun, for me, is the adventurous nature, a new age of tactics to fool people with as the modern age clashes with the ""old"" traditions to determine what is best to solving the world's problems. The movie loads us with plenty of clever plans with elaborate setups, thrilling escape moves utilizing our group's various talents, and some wild card moments to tease you as we work toward the end goal. These exciting moments are stylish, the CGI and practical effects are married into something that feels like an authentic show, but often presented with a purpose that feels pertinent to the story. Clever tricks await those who will watch this movie, with plenty of sleight of hand and amazement present to try and mislead you (alongside the magic of CGI). But it's not just a thrilling adventure designed to keep you on your seat, but it's also loaded with comedy that is fun to behold. Now You See Me's humor continues the practice of sarcasm, banter, mean jokes, and the occasional slapstick moment, mixed and matched to keep things fresh, exciting, and dynamic, like the tricks. Many will enjoy the well-timed delivery of the group, especially as it is not bogged down by the usual sentence enhancers Hollywood chooses. Throw in some music that captures the themes of this series, and the film continues to feel like a Hollywood spectacle In terms of the deeper elements, Now You See Me has the theme of more to the trick than meets the eye. This is true, and you'll find that same wit applied to the underlying story that binds all of this together. Much like the first film, you'll need to keep your mind in the movie and study everything to figure out how deep the connections are. I loved so much of that intelligence, bringing those nuggets that may or may not have been a lead as I tried to get every twist they held. While I did accomplish many of the tasks, there were still a few I didn't quite decipher all the way, which will be fun to look for in a second viewing. Character-wise, the movie accomplished a better balance than I was expecting. Seven characters alone are hard enough to give time, let alone some of the other members that grace the screen with their presence. The movie handles this challenge well enough, keeping enough involvement to feel everybody's inclusion was meaningful and not just another cameo thrown into the mix for fun. And some of the development is glorious, with several stories having that emotional vibe and connection I love in a movie as we pursue growth, surprises, and that idea of shaping them to something more. It all works together at a good pace, only leaning slightly fast at points that suggest time got the best of them.

DISLIKES: Plot Needs Some Work Some Predictability The Middle Element Feels Off Some Of The Characters Still Need Some Tweaking A Better Villain Less Convenient Options Still Going A Tad Too Big The Age Banter Is Mixed Summary: With all the good, the dislikes will be a bit nitpicky at times, but something I think still needs a bit of tweaking to help achieve the full potential. For one thing, the plot needs a bit of work, primarily looking for more time to fully flesh out the characters. Ten years have passed between the second and third films, with a lot of baggage weighing our group down. We didn't have the full time to scope it out, and some of these elements felt rushed. Other aspects are conventional, a few too many coincidences lining up to be feasible, or so elaborate that they were a predictable foreshadowing that pulled the curtain aside too quickly. I found this particularly present when the middle of the movie showed up, an awkward bridge where things felt stretched, logic seemed too suspended, and the pace was a bit too quick and jammed with character elements and rapid action scenes. As for the characters, while they are decently balanced, there is still more to be expanded upon, trying to give our characters more levels and an even playing field. This is particularly true for the main villain of the group, a complex woman who has a lot of resources at her disposal, but barely bears her teeth to show them off. A great profile goes far, but I still think there was more that could have been done to give her a threat outside of the big talk she wielded. I suppose that's the point of the movie, but still, a little more excitement and wielding could have gone a long way. Ironically, the film also goes a tad too big. Several actions feel a bit cheesy, the elaborate setups feel too convenient, and some of the components seem too obvious of CGI to feel as natural as the first film. In the heat of the moment, they aren't too bad as they lean towards the fun suspense of disbelief provides. Yet, a part of me still feels elements need some tweaking to find that best balance. And for the age banter comedy, I felt this gimmick was too much of a focus. The aggressive attitude of generations battling it out can be fun, holding some merit in those key moments, but I found much of the contest annoying, excessive, and quickly growing stale. It does taper out eventually, but for the constraints we had, I would have focused the efforts on some of the balance and excitement this series holds.

THE VERDICT: For a third installment, Now You See Me: Now You Don't, surprise me with how much it recovered from the second film. Reaching for the balance of the first, it takes the plethora of characters and gives them adequate time to be included. Among all these characters, the aspects I liked the most about the film are balanced around good character development, fun comedy aspects, and that exciting chase element these tricksters pull off. The intelligence to the writers and director for capturing the crime and magic components is wonderful, and it feels similar to the adventure I had with the first film. It's all of those elements that make me feel this film is one of the theater-worthy films of the year, and I encourage you to head out for a fun theater time if you can make the time. Dislikes are going to be pickier than most. The film is trying to do a lot in under two hours, and while they accomplish a lot of it, they fail to perfect it. Some of the comedy is annoying and takes up too much time that could have been donated to other characters that had more to explore. In addition, the conventions are a tad harder to swallow as they piled up too much that it became blatantly obvious what they were going to do. And I still hope that they will bring a better villain to the franchise again, one who uses a bit more of their resources to provide a better challenge than what I got. Still, overall, this film was a lot of fun, and I grant the scores: Crime/Thriller: 7.0-7.5 Movie Overall: 7.0.",figurative
"Bateman and Law were terrific Black Rabbit is about when an owner of one of the hottest restaurants in New York (Jude Law) lets his troubled brother (Jason Bateman) back around the family business he brings a whole lot of trouble for both him and his brother. So much so that it threatens to bring down the business and endanger their lives. This is a tense crime story with really interesting characters that will hold your attention throughout each episode. I binged all 8 episodes in only two days. I can't say enough about Bateman and Law. They were terrific. I wouldn't be shocked to see them nominated for some awards for this, especially Bateman.",literal
"'Listen to me' I liked this series when there was a real actors' cast working with some believable scripts, but from the moment Benson became the main character, both as a victim and a law enforcement sanctimonious operator know it all, the acting of everyone involved got so over the top to be either ludicrous or most annoying.

Victims, Perpetrators, Attorneys, Police Officers have all became hollow cardboard characters I find no sympathy for, but instead they are all hateful thanks to the mindless scripts.

Unjust And Misplaced - Sanctimony Viral Underscore should be the title from season 13th on...",literal
"Horrible. Nostalgia couldn't save this mess Showed up for the cast and the nostalgia of seeing two childhood icons together, but the script is genuinely awful. It turns what should've been a cute holiday movie into a lesson on going from bitter to downright pathetic. Even by Christmas-movie standards, this one is shockingly bad. Please keep the writer far away from future projects.",literal
"Long and Nonsensical This movie is entirely too long, but what really annoys me... even more than the Grinch's overacting... is the nonsensical direction the story takes.

The film attempts to tell the story of the Grinch, including a fully fleshed out back story of his childhood being emotionally damaged by the thoughtless Who children. Fair enough I suppose, except the original Grinch tale was about consumerism, and the real point of Christmas being love and family rather than gifts. 

This Grinch eventually arrives at the same change of heart as the original, quoting the same lines that Christmas ""came just the same,"" before returning the gifts. But why? None of it jives with his poor treatment by the Whos earlier on. Unlike the original Grinch who was only obsessed with the gifts, this version gives no explanation as to why he should have suddenly forgiven all of them. The entire thing feels arbitrary and ill-fitting.

Add that to the excessive runtime and the general unlikability of most of the characters, and we're left with a film that doesn't deserve a spot in the annual holiday rotation.",literal
"Without a doubt the best TV show ever made Breaking Bad is without a doubt the best TV show ever made. Everything about it was just phenomenal. The acting, writing, cinematography, all of it. It is truly a masterpiece and large step forward in television. It proved shows could feel as realistic and quality as television and was able to engage audiences and build a world of it's one using this technique. We get to watch the transformation of Walter White from mild-mannered chemistry teacher into drug kingpin. The great part about White is that the transformation is a slow burn, so to speak. The show has received numerous awards and nominations and is still speaked of highly 14 years later. It really effected me so much I was depressed and feeling empty for 3 weeks after I finished watching it. It has the perfect ending and the seasons get better as they go on which is rare and rewatching it I still find all these new details its just so well written. I highly recommend watching it if you haven't yet I promise you won't regret it.",figurative
"a solid 5.8, waste of time and money Repetitive storyline: What do they want from lex luther? The story's exhausted at this point and been done over & over before! There's nothing new and i can't even call it a reboot what a waste of time, expense and energy wow!

Personally like the henry Cavill version better! At least the dark vibe takes the movie out of the childish-political propaganda zone!

We needed Fiona to show up! Just saw this and I'm surprised how good this show was. Each character pulls you in sometimes you hate them and most of the time you love them. But without Fiona they lost a major ingredient in this great recipe.,literal
"Overly ambitious Firstly, a good villain is wasted on a single movie who should have been squeezed out over several movies with tonnes of collaborations between several heroes. It is very apparent that F4 are not a match and not well established yet for such a universal threat and that leads to 2nd point.

Pacing. As I mentioned before, this is the reboot so we are not acquainted with the characters yet. We do not know how capable are they, how well received are them among the people, the state of the world and the multiverse they live in. And we do not know anything about the villain and their capabilities as well. They have to cram all these and more in a two hour movie because they are overly ambitious. I did not feel that I belong in their world because they don't have enough show time to set the stage and at times, all I can feel is the poor CGI world, like I am in a game from 2000s. If you don't feel like you belong to that world, you have no attachment leading to no sense of real threat that the villain is supposed to pose. And also since they don't have enough show time to show premonitions and preparations for the villain, the plot had to make up for it with the director turning a blind eyes to glaring plot holes which is the third issue.

Plot holes. The villain can squeeze all of them to death like Darth Vader. The villain can end the world in a blink of an eye. Even all F4 members combined cannot beat the villain's herald not to mention the main villain. Enough said. So they used all kinds of plot holes and ""talk no jitsu"" to make sense as to why they won. And the worst part? You won't see any real fight scenes. Villain is too powerful to fight head on anyway so they resort to using plot holes and warm holes. And the ill timed forced humour during serious life or death situations like the ""clobbering time"" joke is such a sad attempt.

Overall, had very good potential to be a good intro movie and followed up by a good sequel but they got greedy and ended up with this.",literal
"Unexpectedly good I really enjoyed the first two episodes on peacock. I actually watched them twice in a row. I'm a huge office fan and so far I hadn't seen any kind of comedy to compare. I'm not saying this is the next office, but I'm saying, this show has the potential to be great.

I found each episode to be funny, purposefully stupid at times and also touching and heartfelt. It has all the ingredients to a masterpiece that made the office so well done. If this show is even half as good as the us version of the office, I will be sure to watch every episode with anticipation. Again, I was not let down with the 1st two episodes.",figurative
"AWESOME!!!!!!! I CANNOT comprehend a low review for this show. They either watch other types of shows OR they need to pick apart every little detail of a show/movie.(If you want true crime go watch Forensic Files.). I watched this because my daughter thought I might like it. Reason I went to Amazon movies for the first time. I'm always up for a good thriller/suspense. This kept me on the edge of my seat and I binged watched in a couple of days!! Just when you think you have it figured out, you see you don't. Acting in my opinion was superb. BEST show/movie that I've seen in forever!!! If you want your typical dribble that's the majority of TV now a days, skip this. If you want something different, time to WATCH! Hope there's a season two!",literal
"The downward spiral of a once great show. At one point, the Big Bang Theory was one of my favourite sitcoms of the past 10 years. The first season I thought was great, with jokes enjoyable without understanding the subject matter, but even better if you did. Though the very caricature like characters (mainly Sheldon) did take a way from the realism, it didn't detract from the show as all I still found enjoyable. The only real problem I had was with Penny. Penny is a character that had little to no personality beyond being the ""hot chick"" and was either obnoxious or boring. She was used mainly to explain things to the audience, which it being a wide appeal sitcom is excusable.

Season 2 felt like much of the same, which was good so no real complaints here. Leslie does appear a lot more in this season, and I found her to be a weak character, but some like her so I wouldn't say this season's enjoyment is affected by her.

Season 3 is where I feel the show went downhill. With the introduction of Bernadette and Amy, and a shift of character from most of the main cast from nerds to nerd stereotypes, it's pretty clear that they tried make the show appeal to a larger audience, and by doing so alienating those who liked the clever and nerdy jokes with multiple layers to appreciate. 

All of the characters become creepy and unpleasant the further the shows go on with the butt of most of the jokes becoming the nerd stereotypes, becoming just another shallow sitcom. A friend describes the show as ""Nerd Black Face"", which though it sounds extreme, when you really think about it is quite accurate. I haven't seen every episode after the 5th season, but what I have seen is nothing new, besides the character's relationships with each other changing over time.

Overall, I would say the show is still alright, but not the clever comedy gold it's praised to be.",literal
"Contsant Thrills & Suspense, What's Lurking Around The Corner?? Great Show Just finished watching Season 1&2 over a period of a couple of weekends and weeknights, maybe more. Anyway, fantastic show no spoilers but the end of season 2 I thought it may not have ended the way it did and the chase may continue on with the actors!! Hopefully there WILL be another season - SEASON 3 (Stana Katic & The Rest Of The Crew) anyone - let me know if it will be in the filming stages? ABSENTIA Goes Deeper.....",literal
"Great Movie Do not listen to the want to be Historians on this site. Was the movie 100% accurate, absolutely not, but neither was Band of Brothers, The Pacific, Fury, etc. However, this movie was very well done and told another side of the Nuremberg trials. My wife is not someone who watches WW2 movies, but she was captivated by this movie. Russel Crowe did a wonderful job playing Goering. Do yourself a favor and go watch the movie and enjoy it. It really is a movie that will stick with you for awhile.",literal
"Took a while to find its footing but it's a good show Fans of the original UK series may initially be put off as the first few episodes follow very similar plot lines and it just doesn't work as well. As the series progresses, however and they start to use more original plots the show gets better and better. Definitely a worthy addition to the franchise.",literal
"Not what I expected I really feel the only character that even comes close is Mike's character. I think he's nailed that down. I do not think this show. Is that good. The actor who plays Gibbs, I have no doubt he's got gray ability but he absolutely does not fit the gibs. We all knew from NCIS. I'm not a fan . I'm going to continue to watch it to see if I change my mind but right now I don't see that happening. Can't believe they took off NCIS Hawaii for this!

The show just does not have the NCIS feel to it at all. Not sure what they could do to change that or add to it. It's just not happening. And again they took off NCIS Hawaii for this!",literal
"parasite project A hollow collage of stolen styles with nothing behind it. Phoenix carries the film alone. Stone and Pascal expose their full absurdity - not actors, just marketable faces with zero craft. The rest of the cast ranges from lifeless to painfully amateur. No story, no logic, no focus - just random, disconnected scenes ending in pure embarrassment. A parasite project built only for money, stripping away any trust in the studio.",literal
"Loved it One of the best adaptations of video game. Great cast, great costumes, captures the fallout vibes perfectly. First season is a good setup for rest of the show. It captivates both people that payed the game as well as newcomers. If I have to give some criticism then I would say the actor for Lucy and Maximus needs to step up their acting a little more. I saw someone gave a 5/10 because they didn't see enough variety of monsters and someone gave 6/10 because they are film students and had critiques of the cinematography. Come on set your expectations straight. Be glad you didn't get an assassin creed or uncharted type of adaptation. I guess there will always be some people you can't please. We better hope that Hank isn't in charge of resolving our differences of opinion.",literal
"Decent show but.... I enjoyed the show a lot, but often felt the music was very overwhelming and in bad taste. I didn't like having my ears abused randomly by super loud really horrible music. I often found myself having to fast forward through those parts. The story was very interesting and fresh and it was also cinematically pleasing.",literal
"Unimaginative writing and over-acted If you can make it past the fourth episode you're better than me... The cascade of plot device dumb choices from virtually every main character was simply too much to justify continued viewing.

I really wanted Morena Baccarin to deliver in her lead role but there's no path for her to wade through the myriad of ridiculous soap opera crises and insane decisions. As the town's chief law enforcement officer she's committed half a dozen felonies by the third episode and was on her way to breaking into an evidence room by the fourth. Just...no.

But if that illogical progression wasn't enough, her daughter - and this is the sheriff's daughter we're talking about - manages a train wreck of personal choice every five minutes, including her drug dealing and addicted boyfriend, stumbling on a murder and ensuring to handle the murder weapon, lying to pretty much everyone except when she's unwittingly confessing to a deputy, and delivering cringe-worthy expressions of love for her recently dead boyfriend that she's now accused of killing.

There is no point in putting oneself through the torture of viewing this series unless you're repenting some heinous act and this is your chosen punishment.",figurative
"SO BORING I saw this movie at the cinema today. Didn't know anything about it, just that it was a horror movie.

It was so darn slow. I kept waiting for something interesting to happen and it just didn't.

There was the odd jump scare and a couple of scenes that made it look as though something was going to happen, then nothing did.

I ended up turning on my phone to check the time and how long the movie ran. There were only 3 other people in the cinema besides my friend and myself and I made sure not to bother anyone,.

Turns out my friend had been doing the same thing.

We were just so grateful when it finished.

"NATIONAL LAMPOON'S Christmas VACATION (Jeremiah S. Chechik, 1989) **1/2 Maybe it was because I wasn't too much in the mood for this one (my mother had just broken a leg a couple of hours earlier) or perhaps because I was watching it in the wee hours of the morning, or else the fact that I found it too engrossed in the typical American working-man's preoccupationsbut, the point, is that this would-be modern Christmas comedy classic seemed to me to be little more than a mildly amusing affair. Having said that, this is only the second NATIONAL LAMPOON film I've watched – after the similarly overrated ANIMAL HOUSE (1978) – and the film itself is the third VACATION with Chevy Chase and Beverly D' Angelo playing the Griswolds.

The film starts amiably enough with the amusing animated opening credits, the car chase and tree cutting sequences but slowly starts going downhill once the other members of the family come into the picture. Apart from the fact that it seemed exaggerated to me to have relatives calling at the house for the Christmas dinner from a couple of weeks earlier, Chevy's ""losing it completely"" antics after not getting his all-important (why?) Christmas bonus were pretty over-the-top as well. The ultra-illuminated house gag also outstayed its welcome as did Randy Quaid's rude Cousin Eddiealthough the fried cat bit was funny, as were the perennially ill-fated neighbors. Even so, the supporting cast is surprisingly good: Juliette Lewis (as the Griswold's daughter), John Randolph and Diane Ladd (as the elder Griswolds), E.G. Marshall (as D' Angelo's unimpressed father), William Hickey (as the cigar-smoking, toupee-wearing uncle) and Mae Questel (as the senile aunt).",figurative
"Time to end it This series has been great. Great for the first 10 years. So so since then. This current season is boring. Time to pull the plug. Please put it out of its misery. Without Jethro, Tony, Ziva, Abby the show lacks intrigue, personality and vim. The current cast is okay but I can't get a connection to them. Gary Cole is the best thing it has for now. He's quirky but not volatile enough to add suspense and energy. I think what's missing is the backstory that came with Jethro and his demons. It's imperative for a story to have conflict and there isn't any right now. It's just run of-of-the mill ho-hum mysteries that don't even hold a candle to Agatha Christie novels. And the romance angle for Jimmy and Knight is too soon after he lost his wife, which was in itself a stupid way to push corona propaganda on fans. I hate to see the show run into the ground anymore. Like an aging athlete who keeps playing just to stay in the game, NCIS can't let go and it's embarrassing.",literal
"Finish him No pun intended - if Stephen King can mix up his stories and add stuff from other books ... why not incorporate some games as well? Nothing to do with King (at least not clearly connected), but Mortal Kombat is everywhere right now (new trailer was released), so there is that.

Now if you did not know, apart from being a Stephen King adaptation - this was already done before ... with Arnold Schwarzenegger in the main role ... and this movie right here pays tribute to that .. I reckon one could say it plays in the same universe because of that? Whatever the answer for you is, the nod to Arnold is a stroke of genius.

Also this seems to be way closer to the source than the 80s movies ... plus it has quite the upgrade in the effects department. And it is as violent as it can get ... plus swearing ... so nothing for sensitive souls then.

As close as it is, someone told me that this gets an extension on the ending - it is different. Tone and otherwise - but still at least comes close to bringing that original vision to the screen.

So many great actors in this ... it's amazing to say the least. And much needed and appreciated too. It may take a minute before the ""hunt"" begins, but you need that time to get to know the main character and how he ... well he ticks. If it really is necessary? Well ... there are a few things that do not make much sense ... but we'll just cover them up and enjoy the ride ... won't we?",literal

"Overrated It is a horror movie that is not actually scary. In terms of its level of fear, it seems more suitable for younger audiences. For people above a certain age, it is almost impossible to be scared by this film. Therefore, it feels overly exaggerated. The children's acting is generally weak as well, which further lowers the overall quality of the movie.",literal
Lots of possibilities I'm looking forward to seeing the rest of the season. Here's to hoping it doesn't go the way of so many others by falling down the emotional pit and dwelling on everyone's feelings instead of action packed entertainment like the first two episodes.,literal
"Really beginning to love this show! Wasn't sure about this show in the beginning. Big fan of NCIS and Gibbs! Watched the original NCIS every episode twice from beginning to current. But this new one has grown on us. Looking forward to seeing then introduce and develop all the characters that we've seen throughout the original series. Since Diane has now been introduced we know that Jenny Shepherd, Tobias, Vance and many others will be introduced and developed. This is kinda cool! Of course we still wonder about the Mark Harmon version of Gibbs and what he's doing in Alaska. Sure would love to see him come back for an episode on NCIS. For now we'll have to settle for his narration on Origins.",literal
"Love it, but..... Season one was AMAZING! My first thought was 'why haven't I heard about this show?' I'm a binger, I remember all the hype about Breaking Bad and I thought 'this is so much better, where's all the chatter about this?' That said, season two was a bit of a let down in comparison; I understand that they are touching on real issues, but the race card is seriously every other scene, and why are 'all women are victims'?

When Yanko knocked out that guy on the street, THAT guy was being a racist biggot and deserved it, Yanko never should have been reprimanded.

I'm just starting season three, so we'll see how that goes.",literal
"Paul Mescal Shines in Ham Paul Mescal gives a breathtaking performance in Hamnet. His acting is powerful, emotional, and so natural that every moment feels real. The film itself is beautifully directed, visually stunning, and full of heart. It's a deeply moving story that stays with you long after watching. A masterpiece - one of the best films of the year!",figurative
"Terrible movie, great script This is a classic Bad British Movie. Stalwarts of British comedy acting then and later, plus George Sanders, fight manfully against one of the stupidest plots imaginable - about a government-sponsored brothel for the gentry in late 19th century London. Basically, it was an excuse to have a lot of young women prancing about in lingerie, maid's uniforms, pretty frocks, while baring the occasional boob.

The plot, such as it is, is mainly advanced by extraordinarily implausible coincidences and bizarre happenings, and it's about as silly as you can get.

It's a formula movie, and it sucks. Unfortunately, it isn't quite awful enough to be 'so bad it's good'. It's just excruciating.

However, it was written by Denis Norden, who may have no idea about plot or character, but is a fantastic quip-writer. There are scores of literary and historical jokes: one- and two-liners, many of them screamingly funny if you're familiar with the works of Wilde, Dickens, Trollope, Galsworthy, Tennyson et al, and with historical people like Emmeline Pankhurst and Dr Livingstone. Jokes as good as these are wasted on this awful film.",figurative
"Never judge a TV show by it's pilot We've all seen shows that started with a very exciting pilot suffer a slow boring death. A good show needs more than a good concept at the start, it needs good storytelling, good acting, likable characters and it needs to find a good pace.

The pilot of Chicago Fire was very weak. The story lines felt too familiar (old friends drifted apart through tragedy, secret painkiller addiction, unrequited love etc) and didn't blend together. And, as you can see on this IMDb page, in the next few days a lot reviewers burnt Chicago Fire to the ground.

For some reason I kept on watching. The second episode was a bit better, but by the third episode the show really found it's stride. I've just finished watching the fifth episode and came the conclusion that 1. Chicago Fire somehow ended up to be my favorite new show of the year and 2. All the negative IMDb-reviews are now really unfair. 

Which is why I suddenly felt compelled to write a review of my own. I never do this, so bear with me. 

Chicago Fire is not a procedural 'fire of the week' show. It actually does the ensemble drama really well. There is nice balance between the characters and I especially like how these characters connect with each other and how the story lines are slowly developed. In a way, it reminds me of The Good Wife, but with more action scenes (which is a great compliment in my world) 

The friendship between roommates Leslie Shay (Lauren German) and Kelly Severide (Taylor Kinney) is great. Severide plays the tough on the outside, soft on the inside guy, who walks away from his medical problems by secretly taking lots of illegal painkillers. Not very original or interesting, but I've got to admit that my cynic self is really warming up to Kelley. Partly because Kinney plays the part very well, and partly because of his genuine scenes and aforementioned friendship with Shay. 

Shay is gay, but that's not an issue on the show, just a part of who she is. As it should be, I applaud the CF writers for the way they portray her. Her scenes with fellow paramedic Dawson (Monica Raymund)are among my favorites. 

Dawson also has some cute scenes with new kid on the block Peter Mills (Charlie Barnett), but is too much in love with lieutenant Matthew Casey to notice their chemistry. Sadly for her, Casey is already engaged to another medical professional. This may sound a little soapy or gooey, but actually, Dawson kicks ass. Literally. Which gets her in to trouble sometimes.

Lt. Casey is arguably the real star of the show. He is played by Jesse Spencer, whom I liked in his House MD days, but who really impressed me on Chicago Fire. He plays the classic good guy, but not in a boring way. His intense storyline involving a dirty cop truly propelled the show to greater heights. 

I'm not gonna name every character or storyline, but they're all getting better very fast. (Quick shout out to Eamonn Walker who plays the awesome Chief Boden.) The show may be a bit unrealistic, but that's not what I look for in a good drama. I'm a big fan of Breaking Bad and Dexter, both are very entertaining, and excellently written ánd acted shows, but both are also very unrealistic. Chicago Fire may not yet be on their level of awesomeness, but it is getting there. My point just is, I am really glad I gave this show another chance and I hope that you will too.",literal
"Should have ended after season 1 This show felt like it was set up to be a one season story and it should have been. Season one was great, energetic and had one of my most satisfying season finals.

Season 2 was so pointless and had no real storyline. This season felt completely different, slow paced, monologs that were trying to replicate the writing from season one but came off as pointless rambling, overdramatic moments for the sake of drama.

Spoilers: Season one told us that Mitch was an awful horrible person with hardly any redeeming qualities. Season two continues his story away from the other cast and it's boring. They tried to make him a sympathetic character out of no where and it didn't fit season ones story. I understand that the world's not just black and white and maybe Mitch isn't 100% a total bad guy but season one sure told us he was.",literal
"The White Lotus Really enjoying this new miniseries from Mike White, responsible for movies like School of Rock, Orange County, The Good Girl and the excellent TV show 'Enlightened' a few years back. This one revolves around the changing fortunes of the guests and staff of a wealthy beach resort on a Hawaian island, but that's really just an excuse for an unflinching examination of the interlocking lives, burdens and desires of all levels of modern western society. It's a sort of murder mystery, too.

In a lot of ways, White is like a kinder, more considered and considerate version of Todd Solondz: just as savage and raw in his evisceration of the weaknesses, lies and hypocrisies of all his characters, but always with much more compassion and empathy; you can see yourself in every one of them, and recognize that, in their situation, you would very likely act the same.

His refusal to let his characters off the hook is one of the things I most like about White: his earlier film 'The Good Girl' is all about how Jennifer Aniston's character causes absolutely catastrophic death and suffering all around her, simply because of her refusal to take responsibility for her actions, and thereby lose face with those in her community. This is an extremely clear message, and yet if you go look at the majority of reviews on IMDB for that film, they seem blissfuly unaware of this. So perhaps The White Lotus will suffer the same fate, I don't know, but there's an equivalent moment at the center of the action in this one, relating to the real world suffering and repercussions that accompany the always fashionable 'eat the rich' rhetoric when it is played out in reality, by real people, on real people.

The White Lotus feels much more like one of those shows from 10, 15 years ago, when HBO was still good and the stories still came first. The show benefits greatly by being written entirely by White, and so not compromised or muddied up by too many hands in the mix. It's a rare treat to encounter something so thoughtful, satisfying and broad in its intent, and as a result it's probably the best thing on TV at this precise moment in time.",literal
"Fun time This is more or less what I expected. A bigger but not better movie than the first part, which is a fun time in the theatre. The writing lacks a certain finishing touch, which is reflected in some characters and a lot of dialogue. Sharon Stone was so over the top and tacky that it wasn't believable. The action is also not as fun as it could've been; there were a lot of situations that felt like it was underutilised. But it's always satisfying to watch when the pricks you hate from the moment you see them get thrashed to hell.",literal
"Slow start but worth the wait I don't usually write reviews but I have for the shows or movies I really like. Ben Stiller, Adam Scott and company made a masterpiece. You have to be looking at every detail of the show. The wife and I haven't been invested into a TV show in a long time but this has us at the edge of our seat. When you think you may know something, you don't.

Every actor and actress in this show fits the roles perfectly. Even though it's a slow start, it's because of character development which is 100% worth watching the whole season. When I saw this was rated 8.9/10, I knew we had to watch it and it was well worth it.",figurative
"Started a bit slow but really comes on strong This is more of a classic style detective show rather than the hard-hitting cop shows popular nowadays. Justin Hartley pulls it off quite well as the handsome dude who, along with his witty lawyer sometimes-sidekick Reenie, charms his way through skeptical law enforcement into finding missing people.

The show remains fairly upbeat and doesn't get too dark. They start to pick up with a bit of a grittier style in S2 and I hope they continue.

I think ultimately the show will come down to how well the writers can weave in the main plot of his family background. They haven't done a whole lot with it so far, and honestly it hasn't been all that interesting - although Jensen Ackles as his brother was a major plus for the show. It has mostly been a ""missing person of the week"" style, but S2E9 just wrapped up a longer side story in what was the best episode to date. Hopefully the writers are able to dive further into the multi-episode or even longer-running quests instead of wrapping every story up with the end of the same episode.

The helpers Hartley has are forgettable with the exception of Reenie, so Hartley is doing all the heavy lifting.",literal
"Such insecure Chief of Police! Yes, this show seems like a slightly less jolly murder-mystery series from the Hallmark Channel. Yes, it's quite vanilla. But the one thing that bothers me the most is that one of the main characters, Kyle - who's the Chief of Police - behaves in an extremely insecure, awkward, and shy way, and that's rarely the profile of a Chief of Police. Someone with such a wimpy, languid, and lethargic personality doesn't climb the roles to become a chief of anything, let alone the police. His 6'6 height doesn't help if that's what the casting director thought the actor could bring to the part, as he's often slouching, which adds to the insecure look. It makes the story super hard to believe. He's even hard to understand at times because he speaks as if he didn't feel comfortable getting words out. I'd like to think this is how the character is written (thus, forcing the actor to play him that way) and not poor acting (he's a Sutherland, there's acting in his blood), but I haven't read the books that this series is based on to know if that's the case.

I'm still giving it a 6-star rating for two reasons: (1) I dig small town stories, and (2) Kristin Kreuk. I still don't know why she hasn't been featured in more movies and TV shows. She's got range, speaks eloquently without sounding pedantic (but can also be colloquial), and is subtle but precise with her facial expressions. She's not Meryl Streep, but is quite good, even better than a lot of today's popular actresses.

This show is a good watch if you are looking for something to play on the background while doing house chores or working on your laptop.",literal
"Rare 10 I haven't given a 10/10 review in such a long time, I can't remember.

First off, this is a brutal show. It's up to par with Banshee, with vibes from Oz. It's not gory or visceral, it's just brutal and it grinds you up until your nerves are raw.

It can be funny, it can be mean and it will make you feel stuff. Acting is amazing from the whole cast but Jeremy Renner is just pure awesomeness as a leading man. Again, similar to what Anthony Starr did in Banshee, only better.

Second, It's fast paced, but it still makes you connect to a lot of characters, it makes you hate a bunch of characters. It makes you care. Perfect binge-show and an utter surprise.

I am at episode 8 right now but it can only get better.",literal
"The Shape of Slaughter When Mia Goth's Elizabeth visits muscular Jacob Elordi as The Creature, it's apparent that director Guillermo del Toro didn't really make FRANKENSTEIN to be more faithful to the Mary Shelley novel, but to basically remake his Oscar-winning THE SHAPE OF WATER...

Which was originally intended to be another Universal Monster reboot for CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON... turned into a sexual romance between a very human woman and a brooding, misunderstood monstrosity: The problem is, neither creature is very scary... not enough to fit within the horror-genre as particularly promised herein...

And there are added elements that never needed explaining in James Whale's 1931 classic, like how Victor Frankenstein... played with intensely charmless charisma by Oscar Isaac... was able to build such an elaborate castle-lab to create/recreate life (involving a wealthy Christoph Walz as an expository afterthought)...

An otherwise important process basically rushed through to get to that beauty/beast romance in what's semi-intriguing in the buildup but, once The Creature shares a few moments with his lady-friend (after killing sailors like a tyrannical ninja during the icy opening), it feels like a strewn-together 90-minute montage that could have worked better had it been a more ""fleshed-out"" (pun intended) Netflix miniseries, actually following the plot instead of merely covering the theme.",literal
"Amazing, barely taken my eyes off the tv, can't wait for more Found this show on Sunday and binged it for 14 episodes straight well, except for a brief break when hubby ate. I love hospital shows but they usually show more of staff lives than hospital cases or one main case, the entire hour if The Pitt is case after case of people and drama coming and going in this like an ocean wave. While watching tv I'm usually on my phone, talking to my husband, having a snack, and sort of watching, but not with this series and episodes 12, 13 and 14, I sat barely breathing and only moved between episodes. After watching them, I will become a regular blood donor starting this week! Yes, that unbelievable real and hits your heart hard. Can't wait for more!!",literal
"When did Taylor Sheridan get so horny?? This could easily have been rated an 8.5 - 9. If it weren't for the cringey and so sexualized daughter & ex wife/mother. They serve no purpose to the plot, and are just downright annoying and insulting to west Texas women. A far west Texas man myself I understand where Sheridan is coming from in a sense, but this is awful. West Texas women are the strongest, most ambitious women I know. Now aside from that, the writing and acting are terrific. Sheridan easily has another Yellowstone on his hands if he gets rid of the very uncomfortable interfamily horniness. But again, love me some Sheridan writing (and acting) and an absolutely very enjoyable show, for the most part.",literal
"Expected something more layered A hard film to enjoy, Eddington parades the worst of humanity in front of us and does it through characters so unlikable it's almost impressive.

Ari Aster digs into grifting, misinformation, and the casual cruelty people inflict on each other. At its core, the film is about hypocrisy every character, without exception, wears it like a badge.

The conclusion? Big corporations will always win. Always. It doesn't matter who's in charge, the machine keeps turning.

The problem is, it all feels a little too neat. For Aster, I expected something more layered. The nihilism here isn't subtle, it's blunt and almost hopeless. Maybe that's what makes it sting: it feels real, uncomfortably in sync with the world we're living in.

CGI? That jet and that car scene looked like they wandered in from a decade-old video game.",literal

"Shadows' Edge = Cold Eyes (2013 - Korea Movie) The film is good for me.. Also the actings of Jackie chan & Tony Ka Fai Leung are amazing... The effects is good, not like previous Jackie Chan's movies, you can clearly saw the bad effects/ CGI. Also, i think this is the 3rd movie of Jackie Chan after ""Shijuku Incident"" & 'The Foreigner' as a 'seriuos action movie', less even dont have funny scenes.

But, the story & scenes almost 70% similar like Korea Movie ""Cold Eyes"" (2013).",literal
"Dublin, or not Dublin? I'm really enjoying the plot, the characters and the acting so far (episode 3), but I'm genuinely confused with the accents. I just can't place this bizarre accent, especially that of their sister Anne. Certainly not the Dublin accent I've grown up with. Weird.

But, that aside, sumptuous scenery, interesting plot, and well acted, likeable characters make it (so far) as smooth as a pint of the black stuff.",literal
"Supernatural is a dream for everyone who loves the horror/suspense genre I personally have been waiting to see a show based on spooky plots and this show delivers. Supernatural is somewhat endearing in that the main characters (the only ones who will be recurring) are brothers, however, the writing makes the characters more believable. They are different from each other, each with their own take on life and things that are not typical. I think as the show goes on it will continue to get better,though it is great now. I can't wait to see more of this show! 

Another plus is the little bits of humor placed here and there, which, when done right, is always a plus. Some of the best shows/movies are ones in which one minute you are sitting on the edge of your seat biting your nails and the next you are laughing at some irony or funny statement/joke a character has said. Also, having two very attractive men in the cast doesn't hurt, either ;)",literal
"This is the worst movie I've ever seen! How did this movie ever reach the cinemas?? It is so tragically bad, that it is not even funny. Everything about this movie sucks.

This show is Pretty good The show is about Pip and Charlie. They are the Smiling Friends. Pip is the cheerful one with eternal optimism and Charlie is more of a Squidward character and is a bit more reserved. They go around town helping depressed people because that's their day job.

But it's averaging 9/10, and I'm left wondering how .... it's quite dull.I'll continue to watch, purely because I'm sure it will get good, but entire episodes pass without incident, I get the feeling it's not that good but people are rating it higher purely because of the character they liked from a better show.

"The Long, Hard, Walk: Dark, Difficult, and Needs Detail LIKES: The Atmosphere The Acting The Cinematography The Musical Support The Realism The Dialogue The Character Development The Comedy The Emotions/Thrills The Twists To The Story Summary: King's work is always about establishing the horror atmosphere, something that doesn't always transition in the films when budget, pacing, and a new direction come to mind. The Long Walk, though, is a film that brings King's twisted imagination to life, unleashing a lot of things in the run time they were given. An atmosphere that is realistic, this dystopian future doesn't seem so distant, which brings that scariness to life in ways no CGI creature can. The foreboding elements of this dystopian U. S. A. Hit very close to home, and King's story holds so many components that the movie weighs heavily on your mind. Strong cinematography brings the vision to life, filters chosen appropriately to bring the full feeling behind the moments with ashy grey textures and foreboding shadows of the night. Dynamic angles give you the horrors of the moment in full light, finding the best angles to convey the inevitable, and crush your spirit when the bang goes off. And to keep things constantly moving without losing focus, achieved an engaging spectacle that will match many mental images of the hell such an event would be. Musical elements elevate these moments further, with a heavy focus on piano-led ballads that serve as an undertone of hope, sadness, and even the fight, depending on which scene you are in. It establishes so much without breaking the budget bank, and to execute this material with this much class, poise, and composure is something I appreciate as a reviewer.

Yet, the best filming in the world will seldom tell the story without a good character to anchor to, and The Long Walk has many for one to latch onto. Each of these boys has a different motivation, character quality, mannerism, and backstory, some of them very relevant to the world we live in. While only a few get the true layered effect, the movie accomplishes giving most of the assembled walkers some defining characteristics to keep them separate. Most of these ""secondary"" characters get their qualities in dialogue, which is intelligent, realistic, fiery, and yet poetic, something that is again very hard to achieve. It may not be the grandiose speeches, or some Shakespearean couplet that is ahead of its time, but that personalization and exchange expand the walking to something a little more exciting. And within that dialogue is comedy, which is essential to stop you from completely crumbling into your chair when the first contestant is eliminated. It's not a slapstick venue, but again, that right amount of touch to mirror some of the messages in this movie. And the backstories themselves hold so much merit, many of them holding ideals and approachable goals that you could see the youth holding onto when forced into this mess. The acting that brings it to life is incredible, performances that mostly keep in the realm of belief without crossing too much into the overacting territory. Wareing does his role justice, especially in the end, where he finally gets a bit more of an opportunity to be stronger. Hoffman and Jonsson are the key players here, with so much of the movie on their shoulders as they interact with everything in the group. Their chemistry is incredible, an authentic bond that spreads to the rest of the cast and serves to continue being that torch in the immense darkness that surrounds it. With this superb cast and the production value, the movie accomplishes delivering the emotional thrills, and I found myself not fighting sleep in this film as I waited to see what the film's direction was going to take in this adaptation of the novel. Especially with a few of the twists they brought to the tale. From the recap I read, this adaptation sticks close to the material, combining some key moments into other characters, or perhaps smoothing out some edges that might not be as enjoyable to watch. I liked many of them, and feel it accomplished the herculean task of honoring the film, and within the time frame.

DISLIKES: The Language Some Things Are Really Gross The Hill Scene The Pacing At Times How Hard It Is To Watch The Ending Summary: The movie's limitations start with the language. Again, I can see the realism in the dialogue, but this is one of those films that refuses to use cursing as a spice, but more like drenching it in ketchup. The F bomb is the main vocabulary, and I got bored with the constant use of the word when there was so much more bite, charm, and heat in other words. Past that point, the movie does start to cross into gross territory at times. While this is indeed something one has to consider, I don't find close-up shots of disturbing bowel movements and struggling to handle bodily functions to be rewarding. The focus on some of these scenes with characters we haven't gotten much investment in could have used a bit more censorship, which sometimes is a blessing when you get into the movie. Though the censorship sometimes gets a bit too much, particularly during the hill scene, a pretty big moment in the movie, which gets a bit out of hand and loses some of that coordination. I get the point of the chaos, but maybe not getting so stuck on that one angle and giving the others a bit more time might have helped give that scene a bit more pop, instead of feeling so fast and done. This leads me to the next limitation, the pacing inconsistency at times. I found the film to be pretty good, but the one aspect I didn't like was how many of these characters seemed to have potential, but then get pulled to the side until their inevitable end. That kind of character usage isn't the worst, but I know it could have been better. To know surprise, this material is a hard watch, and while I can't say it's a dislike, I again issue a warning to please be very careful during these times before visiting this film. It's a bit too relevant, it's very graphic, and you need to make sure you have your triggers in check before you step into the film, because many in my theater struggled to watch (per their comments). And when it comes to the ending, well, you'll either like the artistic vision, or you won't. I myself had hoped for something different, but I won't reveal anything to avoid spoilers.

The VERDICT: My time with the Long Walk was powerful. It's a movie that does horror right in many ways, taking a concept that seems so simple and unleashing its full might with the right visual and acting splendor. Fantastic acting brings great writing to life, the portrayals so realistic that it is hard to remember that it's just a movie. And the cinema quality is superb to make this movie one where a good theater will maximize what the story has to show you. Like the Hunger Games meets the Baton Death March, King's writing is captured so well, a surprisingly balanced ballet of darkness where dystopian messages are challenged by other elements the world needs to see. However, the movie is not perfect, with some choices of scenes and language a bit too unbalanced and excessive, which gets annoying at times. Pacing gets a bit off at times, and the new twists may turn the purists away, but given time constraints, it works for me. I'll say again, I think this movie is best in a theater, and currently is my leader for September, but check this out (with steeled resolve) at home if you can stomach the material. My scores for this film are: Horror: 8.0-8.5 Movie Overall: 8.0.",literal
"Incredibly well written and suspensful This stellar drama thriller, starring some high class actors, is definitely deserving of all the praise it has gotten.

I have watched a vast number of films and TV shows from all countries and eras, but this is most definitely one of the better. For very good reason.

The script is definitely beautiful, accompined by some stellar acting. Everyone gives it their all, providing a vast range, both humour and drama, and suspense. As one would expect from such a great cast, of course.

The cinematography, cutting and editing is splendid, and it is all around very beautifully put together.

"Wayward is ambitious and atmospheric, with standout performances. Wayward centers on Alex Dempsey (Mae Martin), a police officer who relocates with his pregnant wife Laura (Sarah Gadon) to the small town Laura grew up in. In the same community lies Tall Pines Academy, an institution for ""problematic"" teens, overseen by the enigmatic Leanne / Evelyn (Toni Collette). As Alex investigates, he becomes ensnared in the town's deep-rooted secrets and manipulations, feeling increasingly trapped as though in quicksand.

One of the series' major strengths is its cast. Toni Collette delivers a compelling turn as the leader of Tall Pines, combining menace and subtle control, especially once her calm facade cracks. Interestingly, her performance here is more subdued compared to the intensity she often brings. That choice works in favor of the unsettling atmosphere, though it may feel like a missed opportunity for those expecting her usual fire. The contrast becomes even sharper when compared to Isolde Ardies, who seems to be acting in a completely different register; almost like she walked in from Wednesday. Her over-animated style makes her stand out, but not in a good way, leaving her performance oddly out of place. Mae Martin, meanwhile, balances the vulnerability of Alex's past with the mounting tension of his present, and it's also notable that Martin created the series, giving the story a very personal angle.

But Wayward is uneven in its narrative choices. While its ambition in mixing supernatural, cult-like overtones, teen trauma, and mystery is admirable, at times it feels overstuffed. The series introduces many threads, flashbacks, community collusion, Laura's hidden past but some of them never fully land. The ending, in particular, is frustrating: Laura seems to assume a chilling new role, a child is passed among followers, and Alex's attempt to escape with his baby never fully resolves. Two alternate endings only add to the confusion rather than providing clarity.

Some moments feel abrupt or illogical. For example, kids are released in the woods and told to find a bell to be freed, one boy wins but then simply returns to the bus. It's hard to discern whether this was meant as symbolism or simply poor plotting. The constant exposition-heavy dialogue, often rapid and dense, leaves little room for breathing space or emotional resonance.

Yet despite its flaws, Wayward is not without merit. It has intriguing ideas about power, control, and identity. It occasionally evokes Twin Peaks with its small-town veneer and haunting undercurrent. When it works, the show is unsettling and provocative. But it never quite sustains that momentum consistently enough to feel essential.

Wayward is ambitious and atmospheric, with standout performances, but its narrative ambitions overreach at times. A watchable series with several compelling moments, but one that struggles to fully cohere.",literal

"Fantasticfied For all you musical fans, I got early access to see this last night, and let's just say, it's everything you will want

Warning: you will be in tears.

Ariana and Cynthia's performance was nothing less than a masterpiece,

The graphics and vibrant colours made this movie captivating

I have already booked tickets to see it again tomorrow night and Friday night and Sunday night...

Worth every penny.",figurative
"complex, deep, a genuine cinematographic experience! Sentimental Value is a multi-layered masterpiece of a film that skillfully shows several generations of a family affected by both historical and personal traumas. The film focuses on two of the generations: father and two daughters living their life in modern Norway and dealing with the emotional baggage from their past in very different ways. The film honestly opens the door for us into this family house so that we see things the way they are, no character is judged or mocked here. Yet, the storytelling itself has its own twists, therefore we can get the pieces together towards the end, which makes this film even more wholesome and delicate. Amazing script, wonderful acting, great choice of music. Bravo!",figurative
"Fantastic! Finally after being quarantined and watching so many duds .... yeah talking about you Sweet Magnolias, here is an excellent script with excellent performances! Billy Crudup, however, steals the show. He literally lights up the screen everytime he's on. This show is an absolute winner!",figurative
"Genuinely terrifying I am a fan boy of horror and thriller. I see about every A list horror/thriller and maybe 1/3 of b list ones that make it to AMC. I had very low expectations for this one. Although it is slow and I questioned where it was going a few times, throughout I was genuinely terrified. Chilled to the bone. After some recent Hollywood horrors including the most recent conjuring where they just got some cheap thrills in, this one was actually written well, and executed even better with the budget they had. Kudos to the acting it was top notch and I think we will see a couple of these guys again. I am still just floored at how good it was. Come with low expectations and you might leave happy. I don't think the production team should have any regrets. They conserved the budget well for the cgi that mattered. Give them a break on the other poor cgi because they obviously had a limited budget.",literal
"Steeped in Nostalgia By the time I got around to watching The Sandlot, I was already in high school. I don't know why that is exactly – It's considered an early nineties touchstone in much the way Pogs, Game Boys and The Mighty Ducks (1992) were back in the day. By the time it was widely available on VHS, the movie was laser-focused on kids my age. To whit snippet of dialogue like ""you're killing me Smalls,"" had actually managed to sneak into my vocabulary without me even realizing it. So by the time I sat down to watch this ode to summer and eye-fluttering nostalgia, I was already at a point in my life where I was knee-jerkingly against everything that everyone else liked.

That is the legacy of The Sandlot that in my mind before setting out for a redemption re-watch. A clichéd, cloying, and unrelentingly sweet kid's movie that had neither the sense of wonder that E.T. (1982) had nor the propensity to revel in its silliness the way something like The Little Giants (1994) did. To top it off it was about baseball, a sport I had failed miserably in, two years in a row. I even had the distinction of being the only kid on my team to never hit the ball when up to bat. Hearing the collective sighs of parents in the stands and seeing the encroaching outfielders strolling closer as I came to the plate was excruciating.

Now that I am older, The Sandlot is more of a silly, good-natured summer movie than a vessel for childhood frustration. It's cute and quotable, liable to give anyone who watches it the same warm feeling when watching A Christmas Story (1983). It's a kid's film from the perspective of kids. Not exactly a rarity but by taking place in 1962, a lack of grounding could've turned out as un-engaging as Newsies (1992).

This doesn't stop the film from loading up the plot with a gaggle of stock characters. There's the leader (Vitar), the fat kid (Renna), the ham (Leopardi), the nerd (Gelt) et al. with Tom Guiry rounding out the cast as our fish-out-of-water and de facto narrator. The fact that Sandlot didn't see fit to add ""the girl"" is unfortunate but then Renna's ""you throw like a girl,"" line wouldn't have been as funny and Leopardi's graft at the pool would have actually had consequence.

What strikes me the most about The Sandlot the third time around (I think) is it's not really about baseball. In fact, other than a late junkyard dog inspired action boost, the movie basically sits there like a summer heat wave. It's not really about anything other than chasing that feeling of no school, no work. None of the characters really change all that much, and inclusion of James Earl Jones feels like a lesson falling on deaf ears at best. At worst, it's a non-sequitur. If we're honest the only thing holding this thing together are a couple of loosely chronological hijinks.

But the hijinks are arguably the best part of the movie and coincidentally what everyone remembers so fondly. The whirlybird scene, the rival team standoff, the extended chase through the neighborhood, it's all so effective in a broad, shameless kind of way. It's during these moments our patience is rewarded with light-hearted, un-cynical entertainment in what otherwise feels like a Skippy's Peanut Butter commercial.

Nevertheless, The Sandlot appeal remains hidden under oh so many layers of quaintness. Even a casual observer will notice the camera-work is sloppy, the acting amateurish and the story lacks urgency. If you grew up with it, watching it a second time isn't likely to change your mind on its merits. Since I technically didn't grow up with it, I can't really see anything other than nostalgia propping it up.",literal
"Unbelievable I'm 30 mins in. I'm finding this hard to believe Dakota and all of the 30 y/o live in $5-$10m mansions, have nannies, and are partners in firms.

"Not bad if you keep your suspension of disbelief The writing is good - Stallone's narration is well written. He's also good in this role. The show moves along and is entertaining. Problem is you have to believe that in today's world, someone would just show up to a town like Tulsa, start knocking people around and making demands and people would just fall in line and not call the police.

In reality, every incident in this show where he knocks someone around and gets what he wants wouldn't happen. Ever. The person would simply call the police, they'd come, see that he did in fact commit an assault, that's he's an ex con recently released from prison and he'd be in jail waiting a new trial.

But in this fantasy world from 1960 (that takes place today) he just makes demands and people does what he wants.

If you can accept that, you can enjoy the show.",literal
"A Hollow, Redundant, and Shockingly Misguided Prequel I have no idea what is going on at HBO, but I am really shocked this is signed as HBO Max production. On so many levels, it reminds of ""Dune"" franchise - you have a phenomenal book, a great translation into a movie and then HBO came up with that travesty of a prequel tv show that made no sense and felt like it didn't belong into Dune universe.

Same applies to Derry - flawless source book, great translation into a movie (at least the first one), and then HBO comes up with this. What even amazes me that in the movies, they were able to fit so much from the source book in just couple hours and keep the essence of the book. The whole point of tv show is that you have extra time and you can develop characters more - here, i do not care about any of the characters at all. And when tv show does not make you feel sad when even children are dying, then they are doing something wrong. Secondly, for a horror show, this series is missing any building of the tension/suspense. As others have mentioned, if there is no build up, then the CGI (no matter how good) looks out of place and ridiculous rather than scary.

I've seen a number of bad King's adaptations, but this has to top the list. Really disappointed how they butchered the source material.",literal
"Favourite day full of Woe, or full of Wow. Wednesday is a fantastic show ( reviewing the show after season 1 ) as very much looking forward to season 2 ( though high standards will need to be kept as it is 9/10 for me, however there is the potential for it to get even better as would love that but if it retains it's current level the fans will be happy ).

The main star ""Wednesday"" Jenna Ortega is simply the perfect casting for Wednesday, however you still need an excellent supporting cast, great script & good directing which this show has, the only reason for me not to give it a 10 out of 10 is because there are a few script issues that could have been done better ( however these are not major issues just minor things so I'm happy to let those things go, as overall the experience is very entertaining ).

Emma Myers ( who plays ""Enid Sinclair"" ) does a great job as ""Wednesday's"" room mate & friend, as helps show another side to ""Wednesday's"" character development which is important for character arcs which are especially very intriguing with ""Wednesday"" being part of the ""Addams Family"" as naturally she is drawn to the macabre ( so this all adds another dimension to it all ).

Moosa Mostafa ( who plays "" Eugene Ottinger"" ) might be one of the ""B cast"" however I really enjoyed this character so I hope we return at some point to the ""Nevermore school for outcasts"" & see all the other character arcs there develop also ( as there are already a few back stories with some intrigue ).

A great season 1 start, let us hope all future seasons are as good or better.",figurative
"Tricks failed to amuse Back after almost a decade, the third outing of the magic induced heist franchise turns out to be more annoying and exhausting, rather than making a strong comeback.

The film introduces three new young magicians to help cater the film to a younger audience, with Justice Smith as Charlie, Dominic Sessa as Bosco LeRoy and Ariana Greenblatt as June RuClair. They all find themselves having similar traits to some of the Four Horsemen. It's the energetic young cast combined with the original four that really give this movie the little life that it has.

The first half is filled with few magic tricks, and more of conversations of the reunion and what happened in the past. The tricks had less spark and the illusions were half-hearted. For all it's disappointments, Rosamund Pike's addition to the movie became hilarious, instead of amusing. The accent was baffling and definitely, this is her one of the weakest performance.

The second half goes into real heist mode, however instead of focusing more on the characters and the writing, the movie spent it's budget on expensive cars and the glamour. There was a short scene of magic tricks between the new gen vs the old gen, which felt awkward, given the context of the scene in the movie.

None of the tricks were memorable or clever enough to be remembered, and that's the most important thing that made this franchise famous. Unfortunately, Now You See Me 3, is at the best, a one time forgettable watch, that disappoints with it's half baked illusions and tricks.

My Rating : 2/5.",literal

"Fun, catty, high-snobiety drama! I grew up in south Florida, so naturally was interested to see what this was about. The story takes play at ""Palm Royale"" which is based on the legendary Bath & Tennis Club in Palm Beach. Membership is notoriously difficult to ascertain, both in this series and in real life (Donald Trump himself could not find someone to sponsor a membership for him which is why he purchased Mar-a-Lago down the street). It's as old money as old money can get. The series is as much an insight into ultra exclusive high society as it is a mystery....

Kristen Wiig's performance is outstanding and will have you questioning what's true and what's not ... I really hope this series continues for a second season!",literal
"Wow! Everyone needs to watch this show!! I've watched all 4 seasons back to back and I am honestly blown away. The storyline, the characters, the scenery, the acting.....Best show I've watched since Breaking Bad! Absolutely loved it. So addictive, I can't wait for the next season 😎",figurative
"One of the Best This movie was pretty amazing. The film addresses amazing themes and it is cinema. However, the beginning of the film was pretty subpar, even if it was still OK. Marissa Bode was also a bit weak compared to the first film. The rest of the actors were absolutely amazing. The plot was pretty good, although Fiyero's character was questionable. The film definitely should have been PG-13, and not PG because it could have been so much better. There was so much that they could have done if it was rated higher, but they couldn't because it was PG. There were also many little details that were amazing to notice. All in all, this film is so close to being perfect, and everybody that had anything to do with the film did a phenomenal job.",literal
"Would have given 10, but... I'm now on season 4. All the actors are great especially 'Pope'. Just one thing stops me giving a 10, and that is Ellen Barkin - talk about over-acting - all those 'walks away, stops, turns, purses lips, glares, swings a hip and mutters...'. She'd be great (seriously) in a British pantomime, where traditionally the over-the-top 'baddie' is booed and hissed at by the audience.",figurative
"Thrilling; realistic; captivating storytelling It's been a long time since I've seen a series like this that is incredibly refreshing, fast-paced, and yet still manages to keep the viewer hooked. Truly binge worthy.

The complex dynamics between the characters and how well Kate (the Ambassador) interacts with everyone around her is truly astonishing. The directors outdid themselves developing each and every one of the characters on screen even though they may not have been the center of attention.

The series does not feel heavy at all. Each episode, there is something new to enjoy and viewers to engage with. Not once have I noticed the plot dragging on and if I'm being honest, watched the entire two seasons in 3 days.

If you're looking for a show that does not miss, this would be it. Kate portrays so accurately what it feels like to not be experienced for one of the most important diplomatic positions in the world, and I really have nothing negative to say. Truly captivating.",literal
"Great and fun cast, taking itself not too seriously, suffers from bad writing That is basically the gist of it. Like in any police series, way too many things happen in one episode and the rookies experience more shootings and heavy crime than most police in many life times.

The bad writing is mostly about how the leave of people from the show is dealt with. They might get a short farewell, but then they are gone and nobody thinks about them anymore for more than one episode. That lacks. Also the writers make quite many characters spill deep wisdom out of the blue that usually takes a life-time to acquire and therefore the only one who doesn't look silly doing it, is the Sergeant. Also it is not credible that the receiving end always follows this advise given. Also it is silly how the relationships that end in the show never have a fall-out.",figurative
"Not sure what I just watched *spoilers* kind of So maybe part of my issue was the first description I read made me think it was some kind of murder mystery thriller. Definitely nothing thrilling with this show. It's just a lot of f*ed up people. I was in episode 3 and was thinking why am I still watching - I mean I kept wanting to watch even though there really wasn't any excitement to it. The thing that makes it weird is the acting is incredible. I love the cast. There's a lot of strange white power, homophobia, drug use, full d*ck inspection, maybe a little date rapey, just lots and lots of crazy f*d up people. I'm one more episode from the end. Like I totally don't know why I'm watching but it's kind of good I guess? Maybe it's just a train wreck that you can't look away from?",figurative
"Trying to be House without Humor or decent writing Had high hopes for this show but couldn't even get through the first episode. Talk about boring and poor dialogue. They have tried to piggy back the popularity of House without the humor, engaging characters or decent storylines. I would go as far to say it was positively horrible. The fact that they decided to have a group of ""doctors"" that look and act like first year medical students and have no substance to their characters.",literal
"Best spy TV show in a long time S. Best spy TV show in a long time, combined with the social commentary that doesn't beat you over the head. And with some very subtle but increasingly fun British humor. You have a winner. Glad they have these into green light already. Of course Gary Oldman is perfect, but no one else has missed a beat either. Budget is movie quality. Writing is top notch. It deserves a nine easily but this is what we can expect from anything that says anything about anything in our world today. I'm just thankful for a show that has an opinion without compromising story or making me feel like I'm an idiot if I disagree.",literal
"Fun Movie But Kinda Rushed Plot Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed this movie. In fact, I was so excited when it was announced. As a long time, K-pop lover, I always get excited when the mainstream media does K-pop centered movies or TV shows. The animation was fun, and the characters were enjoyable, but I can't help thinking that the movie would have been better if it had been a 30 minute, 8-12 episode long show instead of a movie.

From the start of the movie, I had questions that I hoped would be answered by the end of the movie, but they never were. For instance, how did the members of Huntrix meet? How did Mira and Zoey become demon hunters anyway? How did Rumi's mom become pregnant with a demon's baby? And how did she die? And what's with Mira and Zoey's childhood and families? They briefly mention their lives before Huntrix, but we barely get anymore than a revealing line or two from both of them.

Perhaps, I'm just being nit picky. Regardless, though, it was a good movie that unfortunately suffers from what most movies do: too short of a runtime to explain and have time for everything.",literal
"Give It a TRY! Being a physicists, I'm unsure of what to think of this show; however, the chemistry between the ""nerds"" is terrific! It is great to turn on a show that helps bring me back down to earth. The show may be a tiny bit unrealistic when it comes to how ""nerds"" actually behave, but you don't have to be a nerd to appreciate the science humor. In the same respect, the behavior of the ""regulars"" is a little exaggerated, but is done in such a way which helps accentuate the characters' contrast.

So what is to lose from watching this show? 

You WILL be laughing by the end!

"Horribl--y Funny! I don't care to see the British version but may in the future. It only took watching a couple episodes to get me hooked and telling everyone about it. I describe this show as horribl--y funny. Cause it's both horrible and hilarious! Just when you think it doesn't get any worse, it tops itself! William H. Macy plays a great role as an alcoholic father who doesn't take care of his many children and keeps dragging them down in his schemes and vices. It sounds horrible which I'm sure has turned a bunch of people off but when they finally jump on the bandwagon, they always wished they had started it sooner and are hooked. I would definitely recommend this show to almost anyone with a sense of humor, except for children of course. This is definitely not a family show. :)",literal
"Beautiful animation, predictable storyline A friend and I went with the kids to watch Moana last night. I loved seeing Polynesian islands in animation again. The scenery is beautiful--much more of it, and more vivid compared to Lilo and Stitch. The storyline was typical Disney, of course. I feel like I've seen this movie a dozen times before. I would add that I am getting tired of seeing male characters portrayed as cowardly, ignorant, and/or irresponsible. This movie succeeds in that aspect, which is disappointing. Having sons, it would be nice to see a movie where a young man is the hero. Instead, we seem to find thattoo many of Disney's children's movies feature a heroine with weak male characters around her. Other than the above-mentioned observation and the glorifying of pagan belief systems, it was an entertaining and uplifting movie.",literal
Not very good What I don't understand is if you're going to hire all foreign actors would you make it to be an FBI show based in Boston? Why not make it an MI5 show with British actors since that's all there was. Most of their American accents were pretty bad,literal
"A new type of Watson I like it. I love the idea of Watson as a doctor solving medical crimes. I get others see a House 2.0 but I see it as a new show that uses the same format. Many shows borrow from others. Ain't most medical shows some kind of medical mystery though.

But I do like it and will keep watching. I do hate that Holmes is absent and ""supposedly"" died. But it just brings more layers to the show. Oh and the twins, love. Also, I love anything Eve Harlow is in and in this she is great.

5.0 score for this show is just ridiculous it should be more towards 6.8 maybe a little higher. But people gonna rate what they rate I guess.",literal
"What a surprise!! This show was put on on a whim, and wow was I surprised at how engaging and fun it is. The voice talents are amazing (love Keith David and Alex Brightman, and who could argue against Stephanie Beatriz?), and the writing is great! I honestly was not expecting songs, which are really fun, and there are a lot of references to biblical lore, which I find fascinating.

It tackles a lot more issues than just sinning and redemption, and it has an interesting take on demons and the inner workings between different factions. I love the biblically accurate angel representations and attention to detail, and while I was initially skeptical of the animation style, I have grown to really like it.",figurative
"Difficult to Rate I had a tough time setting a rating for this show. While I'd give the first 3 seasons a 10/10, the rest would get considerably less.

This is a show that should have ended with Jim saying, ""Well, then it's a date."" and Pam smiling (teary-eyed) into the camera. It ends there for me, because that's when I set my Netflix back to Season 1 Episode 1 and start all over again. I did watch Season 4 when it originally aired, but was so disenchanted that I never watched another new episode again. It had literally lost all of its magic in my opinion.

In later years, thanks to Netflix, I have tried to watch later seasons, but I just can't get into it. The utter disregard for established characters became too much for me to watch. Michael seemed to suddenly become considerably smarter which, as we know, doesn't happen in real life. Pam, in one episode, literally lied her way into a promotion with a raise. That's not the Pam we knew. Soft-spoken Phyllis turned into a cold-hearted blackmailer. And straight-laced Angela is seen running through the parking lot, chasing after a man she's just met. Obviously she was never really straight-laced, but her attention to that perception of herself was over the top. She went to great lengths to hide any displays of affection or desire - but now she's literally running after a man for all to see? Dwight also loses all of his edge and zaniness by the end. And Jim, who put it all on the line and risked everything for love, turns out to be a guy who hides things from his wife and hasn't the guts to tell another woman to get out of his bed.

Speaking of miraculous changes, Roy becomes a wealthy renaissance man. And when he tells Jim, ""You really helped me dodge a bullet"" (referring to Jim's wife and mother of his children, Pam), Jim makes no attempt to protest. I wasn't sure what we were supposed to take from that episode - that Pam made a big mistake in choosing Jim? Or that Jim made a huge mistake, and his life could have been so much better without her. It was an awfully strange story to tell us, but it encapsulates the ultimate spirit of the series as a whole. Established characters are bent to the point of breaking by the end of the series.

Attention to characters wasn't the only problem with the writing, which steadily deteriorated with every season after the 3rd. I've often heard people say that the show tanked after the Michael Scott character was written off, but that's not true at all. I've seen episodes with Scott in them that are just atrocious, and that I couldn't manage one laugh or even a smile throughout. New characters came and (thankfully) went, and those very few who remained til the end were forgettable in my opinion.

In conclusion, this is an excellent 3 season show, disguised as a 9 season show. It was a touching love story with a highly entertaining and extremely funny backdrop. The characters were consistent during those first 3 years and, if there were any changes, they were explained and sensible. I hear they might be doing a reboot of 'The Office' this year. If they go back to their origins, and put forth these characters as they were originally intended, then it could be successful. Otherwise, we still have seasons 1-3.",literal
"Interesting plot & characters, yet... I have never watched anything by the creator of this animation, matter of fact I have never watched anything in this style of animation at all.

The plot of rehabilitating demons and redeem their souls in order the reduce the overpopulation of Hell is what attracted me the most.

Yet I cannot help but feel that the pace of the animation (which is quite fast), along with the impromptu musical bits and the very detailed characters (in red/pink tones and black) playing on heavily detailed backgrounds (which often are in a similar colour scheme) are a bit too much to focus on?

It is definitely supposed to rich and chaotic, as it is Hell after all, but these elements make the story a bit more difficult to grasp, as it is too much going on.",literal
"This is a very good show. I don't get the reviews of this series lacking focus. It has a continual linear story that isn't out of focus to me. It has a bit of the Ray Donovan vibe to it, with alot of grit, violence, with street and police politics wrapped in. Its much better than City On A Hill, and is in the league with other top shows of this same genre. At times it plays like a network show, with all the cable language, nudity, and violence. It has a nice progression to the end. There are few down moments in Season 1, and I binged watched it hoping Season 2 gets made. I REALLY liked it, and to me it was very much needed during the pandemic when movies and shows were sparce. I'm very picky when it comes to series, and have watched a ton of them. Shows like Gommorah, Justified, The Shield, The Wire, and Breaking Bad to name a few. I would rate it on the level of Prison Break, but it's a little more hardcore than that show, but just as enjoyable. For those who like crime shows you will enjoy this. This is one of those shows that many of the reviews need to be ignored.",literal
"Good pace and captivating This show was a recommendation and I am grateful. The story is interesting and the cast mostly decent actors. There were some goofs here and there and the music choices were terrible. Background music okay but songs were loud, mostly jarring, and inappropriate for the mood or scene.

Otherwise, solid and, frankly, great attempt to have a good native cast and language. The setting is beautiful and was a great character in the story. Good cultural references, too.

Story hooked me and kept me watching the show. The characters felt authentic and it looks like a great set up for another season. I am recommending to others!",literal

"HORRIBLE Casting Wednesday is enjoyably dark and funny; however I'm old so I must compare this to everything Addams going back to the 60's. Luis Guzman is a TERRIBLE Gomez, not charming or eccentric or funny at all. Catherine Zeta Jones should be embarrassed to be associated with this mess. Isaac Ordonez missed the target as Pugsly, just a wrong choice. Steve Buscemi is a joke and another bad decision for Dort. And Fred Armisen is HORRIBLE as Fester. I have to look away in some scenes, Guzman is just wrong.",literal
"Get Stuckmannized........ kind of Chris stuckmann was one of my favorite YouTubers when I was younger. He is one of the few movie reviewers on YouTube who helped influenced my passion and views on film. So hearing that he was directing the film, I was willing to give it a shot. Firstly,the cinematography was great. The first 30 minutes felt very much like an actual documentary, and the rest of the film looked professionally shot too. The acting was also very good. The girl who played Mia specifically. The biggest thing holding the film back is the pacing. This is both the quickest and slowest film I've seen this year. The first 30 minutes of the film was slow, but had me intrigued, but by the middle portion of the film, it felt like the film came to grinding halt, and before you know it, we're in the climax and then it's over. It should've been way tighter paced. Also, the characters are really bland. The main character is given one or two things about them, and they are interesting, but they don't go into any sort of depth. Shelby Oaks is a very solid horror debut with splashes of brilliance, held back by inconsistent pacing and lack of character development. I still recommend watching it, and I'll definitely keep an eye out for Chris's next film.",literal
"Fun Time After just one episode, this show with Kaitlin Olson is already such a good time! It's got comedy, detectives, and yes, a few cheesy moments, but that just adds to the fun. It's definitely got that prime-time feel, but honestly, it works. Kaitlin Olson totally shines-she's always playing such funny, likable characters, and her charm really comes through in every scene. The show is light, entertaining, and off to a solid start. I'm excited to see where the rest of the season goes! If you're into ABC-type shows, this one's definitely worth checking out. Glad we get 10 episodes for season 1 and can't wait.",figurative

"Loved the British Original...US version tops it I've followed the original version in the UK since it started and it's still going strong (to correct an earlier reviewer it wasn't aired on the BBC, it's a Channel Four series). I therefore approached this with apprehension. To take a loved UK program and set it in the US has a history of failures but I liked the look of the trailer and gave it a go. I have to admit that throughout the first episode I was constantly thinking 'oh she's not as good as so and so' or 'I much prefer David to William'. However there was a lot packed into that episode and the script was pretty good. Come episode two I was hooked and to honest much prefer this version.

It has cleverly achieved what the UK version has in taking a subject and a group of characters that most people should loathe and turned them into a lovable group, all beautifully portrayed. Real, rounded, believable characters and so many of them too. Many people will have been turned off this by the trailer and thought it's not for them which is a shame. It really is extremely well written with great pace and some superb performances. I love Emmy Rossum and her portrayal of Fiona is astounding. I agree that William H Macy's Frank is more likable since he isn't always drunk and Joan Cusack is perfect as Sheila (I found the UK Sheila quite annoying).

We are only up to episode 7 of the US series here in the UK and its top of my weekly viewing. Great to see they are making a second series in the US and in fact given they have plenty of material to use, since we are up to Series 8 here in the UK, I hope it has the same longevity.",literal
"For the 1 ratings out there I've read a lot of comments rating this show with 1/10 complaining about:

1. Plastic armor 
* Honestly... you expected real stainless steel, plate or perhaps ""dymeritium"" armor? Get real... The armor design of Nilfgaardians is questionable, yes, but for me it wasn't at all distracting, which is good. The Cintra armor was great, Geralt's armor, while not the same as the games or missing a few details from the books, it serves fantastically in a TV show, where it conveys the overall ""feel"" of a Witcher, but doesn't distract.


2. Had to adjust the volume because of the mumbling 
* Maybe your mom's basement doesn't have all that good acoustics or you have hearing problems as well as stingy with a pair of headphones / sound system. The sound was good, the voice was great (good job, Henry) and the music was okay.


3. Low budget 
* Because these people in particular are very well informed in the costs associated with producing a series -sarcasm. I will say this though, in two or three scenes the CGI is good, not great, but I appreciate that they tried to work around it on some points, George Lucas style. The mage spells, Witcher AARD sign looks AMAZING. The dragon looks a little anorexic when compared to what I'm used to, but this a new World, with new beasts and I'm prepared to accept this. In terms of actual costs, as far as I could see, they spent a great deal on it, more that they did on GOT.


4. The story is too fragmented, all over the place 
* I see some more sense in this, but still not enough to rate it 1/10. The loose ends are mostly tied up in Episode 8, and since they are based on books, I'm just going to say that the books are similarly fragmented, so... no points for you.


5. Yennefer and XYZ are dark skinned 
* I really didn't even noticed it until some illuminated race hunter pointed it out, she looks white and she fits the role tbh. I will say this though... some of the forced racial casts in the show don't make sense, but they don't really put you off from the overall story, except that it's supposed to be a very racist World, where people hate other people because they have pointy ears. Doesn't make sense for them to ignore skin color, but I kind of gotten used to this agenda, it's not the show's or actor's fault. Putting a little imagination in it helps accept the diversity in a logical manner as to how and why this could be. The siblings in the show all share the race so it's not off-putting, i.e. If a girl is black, her father will also be black and vice-versa, again, no reason to rate it 1/10 .


6. ""I'm not a fan of Henry Cavill's acting"" 
* These comments without constructive reasoning behind them just sounds like boomers with erectile dysfunction hating on random things for no particular reason. Henry Cavill does an amazing job as Geralt, his form, intimidating presence and the !!!VOICE!!! is just great! I did have doubts, I admit, but damn, he's is now my favorite actor, and definitely the top 1 of ""People I'd like to meet"" list. Other actors do an amazing job as well, I literally couldn't identify a single actor who I'd say ""dropped the ball"", the main ones definitely didn't. The character of the Witcher is portrayed exactly as it should be, if you don't like it, then this is simply not your batch of cookies and you shouldn't try to persuade others into not watching it just because your super-refined tastes in cinema are ""rather singular"".


7. Too much exposition 
* These ones are just pulled right out of their asses. I'm sorry, but I've watched this series with a person who has no idea about the books or games, and it's exactly the LACK of exposition that is noticeable. For new viewers I would suggest reading up on what the ""Conjunction of Spheres"" is, as to understand the environment better, because there simply isn't an explanation on this. Everything the characters discuss seem natural in their given context and I don't feel patronized when someone is explaining something in the show. I would have liked to hear Geralt explain certain small things about creatures, like the necrophages, dragons like they do about the striga.


8. Camera angles are all over the place 
* Didn't notice anything like that. Sometimes they will tilt the camera angle a little (or a lot), but it's done in a way that emphasizes the situation at hand so I felt it was a nice touch.


9. Just another GOT series 
* Uh, no. This show tackles the subject of universal right and wrong, Order and Chaos, Life and Death, the necessity and impact of making decisions, the concept of destiny, from the close-up view of it's characters, who are not kings or lords (except for Ciri maybe). There is nothing of the sort in GoT, that made me understand valuable life lessons, just a bunch of rich, high lords competing for a throne. Anything that couldn't amounted to a life lesson they killed off in 2 seconds after building them up for 8 years. Also these people are not ""playing war"", instead there are political events that influence them and they are forced to react/adapt to it. They are not the ones pulling the strings, much like most of the viewers.",figurative
"Appalling Such slop.

Sharon Stone as a vicious villain is straight out of AI's idea of a comic book villain. Zero depth, a stack of cliches, and a general feeling of embarrassment watching it unfold.

The script is awful, again AI worthy, with the same formulaic progression, the unimaginative action scenes, and a blatant disregard for realism. Suspension of disbelief is one thing, but this was brutal. You get guys wearing full tactical gear getting shot in the chest on their body armours with small round ammunition, and blood spilling from massive entry holes. The good guys wear zero armour, walk around fully exposed in front of a literal army of guys with machine guns with scopes, and nothing happens to them, while they execute everyone with small calibre guns. The story arcs & scenes are as dumb, tired and cliched as one could possibly imagine. Mob lair with mountains of cash, bio weapons, drums of flammable stuff, sports car, even an antique looking table saw, all in the same frame, for absolutely no reason other than laziness and mediocrity.

Absolutely appalling, and an insult to the original movie that was so good.",literal
"Best Series in Years This show is everything TV should be. An absolute breath of fresh air after all the Hollywood bilge of recent years.

Hollywood: take note. THIS is how you write ""strong women"" and interesting characters. The writing is great. And of course, it takes the Brits to lead the way. Brits doing Britain are in their prime. (Just keep them away from trying to write anything about Australia).

Gary Oldman is absolutely brilliant. His acting is unparalleled. His character (Lamb) is gross, but loveable. A rambling mess, but a canny strategust. There are no flies on Lamb.

The other characters in the shoe are equally brilliant. Fantastic acting all round.

The only thing I'd say is that character development means a slightly start slow. So give it three episodes before you call it quits.

More TV like this please!",figurative
"Based on the entire show and not only early days I was watching this show when it came out. It started out like a show about horror stuff you usually only see in horrow movies, but they take them all on in this show. The show was groundbreaking like something I have never seen before. Story seemed amazing. After a few seasons I fell of this show and lost interest, maybe bcs it was so long. But its glory days made me wanna rewatch it and finaly finnish it after many years. I took a while but I felt it was worth it. The stories seemed to tie togheter in a nice way. The plot twists are few episodes between sometimes. The way they builth this universe was very nice and makes sense within that universe. The only thing I didnt think was fitting was when they introduced mythical creatures in something that looked like human form.

Just finished the show and I feel its a good show.",literal

"I wanted, SO BAD, to like this. Really. Oh, what a God Awful production. There are a few saving graces; Allison Janney seems in her element. WONDERFUL to see Julia Duffy (Newhart) on the screen. Ricky Martin holds his own, but the rest of the cast really seems... rote. Even Laura Dern feels... forced. And it is truly a shame that the spectacular. Carol Burnett, other than in a few flashbacks, is reduced to playing a comatose body for most of the first three episodes (as far as they have been released to date). This show needs her; just the snippets of her have.raised this train wreck to incredible heights.

I was trying to place Leslie Bibb then realized she was the star of ""GCB in the early 2000's, which has a lot of the same vibe that Palm Royale has.

The other saving grace for PR is that they nailed the atmosphere perfectly.

I don't know if I care to watch the rest of the series. I REALLY wanted to like Palm Royale, but after three episodes, am finding the dialog and plot to be just annoyingly bad. Not entirely a Kristen Wiig fan. When she goes out of swimlane (comedy), she really falls out of her element (WW84), and she is woefully out of her element here.

I am giving it 4 stars for Ricky in a bathing suit, Allison, Julia and Carol, but... that's about it.",figurative
"I only watched for the 2 main stars, but huge disappointment There it is a true story, great, but it is so boring, too long, that I played with my mobile after 90 mins.

It is dumb army guy who only knows how to play with guns and hiding. And charm woman, but he is useful in all other areas, being a dad, father, and a criminal.

If this is a true story, then he is stupid criminal, as he goes half way and try to be a nice guy, even his friend is smart, criminal are bad. Full stop, there is no other ways.

He could have move on but he didn't, come on he think all love him, but he can move on, escape and find new love, new kids etc.

It is just a ridiculous story of a failed man.

He is given a chance and he keeps messing it up, so no, life stop giving him freedom. He is greedy and wanted more and more.

"Sentimental Value: A Profound Exploration of Familial Reconciliation Through Art :::Watched at Scandinavian Film Festival:::

Joachim Trier's Sentimental Value is a deeply resonant family drama that eschews melodrama for emotional authenticity and psychological nuance. The film is centred on Nora, played with great restraint by Renate Reinsve, who is forced to confront her estranged filmmaker father, Gustav (Stellan Skarsgård), after the death of her mother. The family home in Oslo emerges as both setting and symbol-a container for memories and scars-which Gustav hopes to immortalise through his latest cinematic project.

Trier handles the motif of inherited trauma with tact, refusing to indulge in manipulative sentimentality. Instead, the narrative unfolds gently, through carefully observed interactions and silences. Nora, a stage actress paralysed by anxiety and divided loyalties, is caught between the burdens of family history and the demands of performance. Reinsve imbues her character with a delicate sense of unease that never spills over into theatrics, while Skarsgård navigates Gustav's arrogance and regret with a similarly subtle touch. The supporting cast, specifically Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas as Nora's sister Agnes, adds depth to the film's meditation on the countless ways familial love and resentment can coexist.

The script delicately questions the ethics of artistic catharsis, as Gustav asks Nora to recreate painful family events on camera-prompting sharp consideration of the cost of using real trauma for art. Elle Fanning, as an eager Hollywood star parachuted into the family's drama, serves as both mirror and foil to Nora, further sharpening the film's self-examination of performance, legacy, and authenticity.

Visually, Sentimental Value is quietly gorgeous, its crystalline light and carefully composed frames echoing the story's sense of longing and the weight of the past. Trier's refined direction and restrained musical choices allow every emotional beat to register fully.

What endures is the film's generosity and honesty. It does not force reconciliation but gently suggests that understanding alone could be redemptive. Sentimental Value is demanding, reflective, and full of love for flawed people, confirming Trier as one of the most perceptive filmmakers working today.",literal
"Welcome to Derry Delivers"" IT: Welcome to Derry is a solid horror series that really nails atmosphere and suspense, with Pennywise as terrifying as ever and the adult performances bringing real depth. The town feels alive, full of secrets that keep you hooked, and the storytelling mostly balances tension and emotion perfectly. Some of the younger characters' arcs don't hit as strongly, and a few moments drag or show slightly off CGI, but these are minor hiccups in an otherwise gripping show. Overall, it's a strong 8.5-9/10 - highly recommended for horror fans.",literal
"Always get a kick out of this movie, but where was the vacation? In 1989, Christmas Vacation was not viewed as a well done movie. In 2009, 20 years later, it is a GREAT family movie, compared to the junk like the ""Squeakel"" or whatever piece of chip...munk that is out.

Of all of the Vacation films, this is by far the best.

From the struggle with the lights, to the wonderful husband and wife relationship, this movie is one of the rare ones where the family all pull together in the end. Oh sure Griswold is a dunce, but his beautiful wife has her moments of silly dumbness as well. The children are both wise and dunces at times as well. Great balance.

Only one question: The family wasn't on vacation were they? Didn't Griswold have to go to work? Did I miss something? Oh well, fun and jolly, something you don't get anymore. Skip the commentary on the DVD, waste of time.",literal
"""Well, that hit the spot."" As many of my friends know, there are still a handful of Arnie movies I haven't seen. Sure, I've covered the big ones-Terminator 1 & 2, Predator, ... ... Jingle All the Way, Kindergarten Cop-but I somehow missed the boat on a bunch of his classic action vehicles.

Enter Alamo Drafthouse. This month, they're screening a whole lineup of the ones I've missed! Sadly, I'm out of town for a lot of them, but I lucked out and caught a free screening of The Running Man.

I went in totally blind. Watching this in between Alamo's Hunger Games screenings made for some pretty hilarious irony: Dystopian society? Life-or-death game show? Rising rebellion? It's all here folks!

What surprised me was how much this '80s movie got right about the future. Voice-activated tech like Alexa? Check. Deepfakes? Check. Political and televised misinformation? Big check. Set in 2019, the movie felt eerily prescient. With it being based on a Stephen King novel, I half-wondered if he had access to the same time machine the Simpsons writers use. Of course, it still feels very '80s in style-campy, neon-soaked, and gloriously over the top-but that's part of its charm.

As for the movie itself, it was pretty much what I expected: pure, unfiltered '80s camp. Not all of Arnold's one-liners landed, but the ones that did? Chef's kiss. That said, the true MVP was the Elderly Lady in the audience (credited simply as ""Elderly Lady""-I think her name was Agnes). When she said, ""That boy's one mean motherf***er,"" I nearly lost it. Heading into the golden age of Arnie, who could disagree?",literal
"A Serious Topic - Treated Trivially I watched it as a Secret Movie and expected that it would be a horror movie (and I would have walked out). But the premise of someone dying and going to heaven is such an important concept for me that I stayed until the end.

I rated it low because it made a complete mockery of something that should be inspiring (in a completely secular way).

Death and Eternity is a serious topic and I felt that they trivialized the entire concept. The ending (which I won't spoil) was not how I would want to spend eternity.

But the good outcome for me is that while the movie was progressing, I was thinking of my life and realizing that we need to choose wisely while we are here on earth. And I was thinking of those who I have loved in this life and I was thinking of the person I would want to spend eternity with.

And THAT caused me to reflect on my own life and to look back on how I had treated the people I have loved. And at that point in the movie I realized that whatever I thought of the movie didn't matter at all because it (the movie) had already led me to really appreciate the person I have loved the most.

Being alive is (even from a completely non-religious point of view) is one of the most miraculous events in The Universe and we (at least I) should appreciate each day that I am allowed to exist on this planet.

But still, the movie itself was too trivial and is the reason for my low rating.",literal
"Solid start, predictable end I started watching this before there were any reviews, which I almost never do, because I knew that Sarah Snoop could act as a paper bag and she'd be fantastic. The acting on this show was stellar all the way around.

The first episode was one of the best and genuinely most engaging I've seen in a long time. From there, it lost a bit of its lustre.

Now that there ARE reviews, I'm shocked to see how the majority of them say there was surprise after surprise, twist after twist. I did not find that the case, and found this show so incredibly predictable that I watched the last 4 episodes while doing other things because I already knew everything that was going to happen - and thought it was pretty obvious, but perhaps not. That said, I DID keep watching and am glad I finished the series - and there was one twist I didn't see coming, arguably the biggest one that is alluded to at the end of episode 7 and confirmed in episode 8.

Other than that, there was a lot about this miniseries that seemed superfluous (characters that had zero development or function, dragged out plot lines).

Overall, though, worth watching if you enjoy the genre, if for no other reason than the actors are great and the pacing makes it an easy watch.",literal
"Fan of the books. In my mind Jackson Lamb was Timothy Spall and Katherine Standish was Olivia Coleman and I think they'd have nailed it.

That said the casting is spot on, everyone is great. Also there should be a massive shout out to the location scouts, Slough House is exactly as I imagined it.

The mood, intrigue and pace are as good as Tinker, tailor, soldier, spy.

I have loved the books so much and am so happy that this has not had the over the top Hollywood treatment that these things often do. It's kept the grime and the humour that have made the books so enjoyable.

I'm episode four in and can't stop..",literal
"Tis the season to be ... ... crazy? At least at the brink of madness at times. Chevy Chase as Mr. Griswold .. not few will remember those names. I reckon some might have wanted to be in the extended and already big Griswold family alltogether. Now I might have rewatched this out of season, but I do think it works no matter what time of the year it is.

And that is what makes this a great comedy. Also the actors and the script involved! Some jokes may be a bit .. well don't be too woke about certain things or too PC. Also yes some are just plain silly and there is a lot of don't try this at home stuff. It's a movie, try to accept it (like when Chevy is in the attic and sets his chair in the one spot where it makes no sense at all, other than to get a laugh out of the audience).

So great cast and good natured humor. What else do you need?",literal
"Bright cape, Empty core. I honestly don't see how this movie could impress anyone older than 10. Sure, it's colorful, lighthearted, and has a few crowd-pleasing moments - but underneath the cape and charm, it feels more like a Saturday morning cartoon than the cinematic relaunch of an iconic hero. For a character as emotionally rich and symbolically heavy as Superman, this version felt oddly flat, even juvenile.

The movie opens with a tone that hints at something deeper - maybe a layered origin story or a grounded emotional arc. For a moment, it feels like James Gunn might give Superman the complexity he deserves. But that promise fades fast. Instead of evolving into something meaningful, the story flattens into a series of lighthearted moments, cheesy one-liners, and safe, predictable beats.

It's like the film is afraid to take itself seriously for more than five minutes. Every time it flirts with depth, it quickly retreats to humor or surface-level charm. That approach might work for younger audiences, but for anyone hoping for a mature or compelling Superman narrative, it's a letdown.

Most of the cast did a decent job - nobody was outright bad, but no one really stood out either. The performances felt safe, almost like everyone was playing within tight creative boundaries. Even characters who are supposed to command the screen - like Superman and Lex Luthor - felt surprisingly muted.

David Corenswet as Superman checks the boxes visually, but his performance doesn't leave much of a mark. There's no real emotional weight, no moment where you truly feel what Clark is going through. And Nicholas Hoult's Lex Luthor, while an interesting casting choice on paper, lacks the menace or charisma that makes the character memorable. He's just... there.

It's frustrating, because these are some of the most iconic roles in comic book history - and yet the film doesn't give the actors enough material to make them feel iconic.

Are bright, the costumes pop, and some of the early shots are eye-catching - at least for a second. But once you settle into the movie, it all starts to feel a bit stale. The CGI is fine, but nothing we haven't seen before. The action scenes are clean but lack intensity or creativity. There's no real visual identity that sets it apart from every other superhero film.

It's like eating candy with no flavor - it looks fun, but you stop caring pretty quickly.

Superman (2025) feels like a movie made to play it safe - colorful enough to distract, light enough to entertain kids, but ultimately hollow for anyone expecting more. It had the opportunity to bring real depth and emotion to one of the most iconic heroes in fiction, but instead settles for a flat, overly sanitized version of the character.

If you're under 10, you might love it. For everyone else, it's just another cape in the crowd.",literal
"A Lot Of Fun; Looks Great On DVD I found this a very entertaining small kids movie that actually is geared more for adults with a lot of jokes and humor only they would understand. A few things are inappropriate for the kiddies, but just a few. Othewise, ""The Grinch"" (Jim Carrey) cracks so many jokes you can't keep up with them all, ranging from sexual to cultural to insider-Hollywood to racial.

The film is very colorful and looks great on DVD. The little girl in here, ""Cindy Lou Who"" (Taylor Momsen) is really cute and the costumes and hairdos of the little people in here are fun to view. Anthony Hopkins' voice is pleasing, too, so having his narrate this elevates the movie further. His rhymes are fun to hear.

I saw this in the theater, though it was ""fair,"" but on DVD, it was far better. I've seen in three times and it got better each time.",literal
"Candid, Dark and Provocative The second season is not trying to make friends (this rating is for season 2 only). It is actually a movie that will infuriate anyone who takes a side on the case before watching. It will infuriate those who believe the Menendez brothers were justified to kill their parents.and those who supported their defence and believe their sentences should've been reflected by their plausible sexual abuse story and those who believe they killed strictly for an inheritance.

This was a difficult story to tell because (a) the subject matter is/was intensely sensitive and (b) the Menendez brothers motive is still being hotly debated today.

You don't have to pick a side. Nathan Lane (playing Dominick Dunne) and the screenplay can lead you either way (Lane, BTW, was brilliant in this). What I do extricate from this film, like 12 Angry Men, is how complicated justice can become even when several people agree on the same sequence of events..",literal
"Incredible, engaging, enthralling story Just remake season 8 please. It's the best show I have ever watched. Season 7 is still good but very different.

Going into this my expectations was that this will be the next Ozark...I was wrong. It's nothing like Ozark. That doesn't mean this is bad, it's just not as good as Ozark was. The reason this is so good is the acting performances by Bateman and Law. Both were as good as ever. This probably could've been done in 6 episodes because there are times where it slows down to the point where they could've cut some time out. Other than that it's absolutely worth watching.",literal

"The best subtle humor in a long time This show has a quick witted bite to it that I haven't seen in a series in a very long time. Too many slap sticks jokes in one minute to even allow one to stop laughing. This is the Three Stooges meets Office Space meets Superstore, ya I said it... The Three Stooges!

Even a few of the Superstore staff have popped up and are just fantastic. The scenes in the lounge are so reminiscent of Superstore (which were always a fan favorite) and even more quick and clever.

The storylines (if you can call them that), are so well thought out and catchy it makes you think why aren't there more shows like this on TV. I'm a fan and hope this renewed ad this show deserves attention.",literal
"Incredibly compelling! This show was made for the binge-watchers... Rhys and Danes are fantastic in it. Their chemistry, albeit sinister, is also quite addictive.

"It's watchable but the HORROR was oversold. I WAS SO EXCITED FOR THIS! From the first ever teaser trailer to the MARKETING like wow I was hooked! Watching it this night in IMAX was kinda disappointing read on down.

Story: At 2:17 alot of kids just run out of their house. That was all I needed to go in on and the movie delivers the mystery and intrigue very well. Once they set up the mystery you do feel like your taken on the journey of discovery. The ONLY ISSUE is horror buffs will IMMEDIATELY catch on to what's going on. Once I kinda already knew what was happening it kinda takes you out because you as the audience knows but the characters do not. Alot of pretty convenient opportunities happen in this movie as well that kinda made me raise a eye.

Horror: In my opinion they really should have committed to the scares BUT THEY DON'T. The comedy SHOULD have been REMOVED like TAKEN OUT COMPLETELY! Some genuine scares are COMPLETELY DEMOLISHED by the director wanting you to laugh. In the opening shot you get like punk rock music WHEN IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN A CREEPY AMBIENCE!

Story: Multiple perspectives are shown in this movie and some are used to amazing effect. It's was creative for the first hour but again once you the audience member finds out what the threat is your kinda just watching it unfold waiting for the characters to catch up.

Overall I didn't hate the film and I enjoyed it so much more then barbarians but that wasn't ever a high bar to me. THE MARKETING OVERSOLD THE SCARES and they turned the scariest moments into comedy. I couldn't shake the feeling those who wait for streaming will Definitely enjoy it alot more in their houses. Losing those scares kinda makes it your preference if you pay to see it on the big screen or not.",figurative

"'Sons of Anarchy' -- without the anarchy I was disappointed because we've seen this all too often before, starting with the setting, a Disney version of Southern California, that demi-paradise of blue skies, beaches, drugs, palm trees, pools, etc. It should have been set in Fall River, Mass., Milwaukee, or Baton Rouge, cities that in their struggles against collapse, express a screwed up America. 

The thing about the original missing here is the working class suburban setting that cries out betrayal and desperation. In contrast, the US version, with its large pool, well-nourished bodies, and tasteful, coordinated decor exudes middle class smugness and boredom.

Characters and relationships, too, come 'off-the-shelf.' The actors are competent, though not required to do much. Finn Cole ('J') seems to have been cast at least partly for his ability to wear a pair of tight jeans. The men take off their shirts -- and more -- from time to time, so, no complaints there. Adding a little twist: hints of a gay plot line.

I would like more of their -- evil? righteous? -- adversaries, the police, striving to put this family away. Maybe the writers will fill this in more as the show progresses. The family members badly need some strong characters to set them off, make them stretch themselves, and, most of all, give this show a jolt of energy.",literal
That Depends On The Wolves I put this show on just to kill time and ended up watching all 4 episodes that are currently available. Glenn Powell is proving to be a star in any role you put him in and he's great in this. Half way through the second episode it seems as though the show is gonna fall off because there's only so much you can do with this character but then episode 3 and 4 were great and has me excited for the next one. It's clearly a dumb show but it knows that and takes it in stride. Check it out.,literal

"A Great Show - But 6 Episodes??? This was a very enjoyable show that seemed like it was barely off the ground. In a world where we went from 22 episode seasons to 10...just 6 feels like a slap in the face.

Candidly, had I know that it was only 6 episodes before starting I wouldn't have started it. I would have waited for a second season to get to a normal season length between the two.

I like the premise and the actors but it's just too short and didn't develop. I still really enjoyed it but hated the length and the end. Rated it highly but would rate it lower given the length - just don't want to hurt chance or a second season (to make 1 full season)",literal
Miscast Gibbs Disaster Just from the sneak peaks it was clear that the wrong Actor was cast as Jethro Gibbs. When your supporting cast shows more charm and interest than the Lead Actor.... It becomes a big problem . So much talent in the Hollywood talent pool and the Best CBS could do is Austin Stowell ??? Stowell is walking thru his part and performance is flat as a pancake . NFL superstar Travis Kelce could have added the chutzpah the role needs . Cast Kelce CBS . The Young Jethro Gibbs needs the presence of Alan Ritchson (Reacher) or John Krasinski ( Jack Ryan). CBS needs to recast role quick . If Not this NCIS:Origins will collapse Joker 2 style .,literal
"Good but not good enough Yes I know turning a novel into a script for the big screen will change things BUT.. Not enough character development had me not caring or holding any feelings for the walkers, which I had in bounds whilst reading.. The 'boys' are young men, which changed the 'coming of age' aspect.. That said some core elements were kept and it's a good movie.. Would probably had given it a 7 had I not read it multiple times..",literal
Getting political Was great until recent political topics spending a lot of time checking off leftist agenda still a pretty good show hopefully it doesn't go woke and broke,literal
"AGAB Edgar Wright's kinetic flavour isn't quite as present here as it has been in the non-Cornetto flicks like Baby Driver and Scott Pilgrim. There are certainly some finely crafted action sequences that have the Die Hard survivalist vibe, particularly a hotel sequence with Glen Powell in a towel. Glen is fantastic in portraying the hyper masculine but kind anti-hero who just wants to help his family, and is down for the class war cause. The side characters are fun like those of Katy O'Brian and Michael Cera, just wish there was more of them. Coleman Domingo is an absolutw treasure here. Daniel Ezra is great and fully utilised, particularly in the Youtuber truther alter ego. I'm more a fan of the script than Wright's direction, which is more on the level of the Stahelski/Leich. It's still a good time action-wise and Marcus Rowland's production design for a retrofuturist world makes it lived in, even if the film is also all about modern evils like deepfake AI. I'm a sucker for anticapitalist art, even if it's got corpo backing which can have the potential to neuter, and here the message is more in that old school Network (the villain is literally The Network) manner of ""stop watching"" this bloodlust circus, and Black Mirror's Fifteen Million Credits was able to update. It's not as grim an ending as the book or Black Mirror, but I still cared for the characters' plight and enjoyed it.

The revolutionary zine aesthetic over the credits is peak. Stayed for the whole credits because of it. Just wish the film had that energy the whole time. AGAB.",figurative
"There are worse movies but not as good as the first 6/10 gave the first 8/10

Pros Ethan Hawke is great Has that hot latina chick from Working Man In it.

Well made.

Cons Finn takes too much of a back seat to his sister Although impressive they were able to tie everything together; you can totally tell they made all this stuff up in retrospect and that everything that happens and and everything we find out in the movie only exists as to try and justify the sequel.

If there are going to be more black phone movies they need to do the following

1. New characters with new ghosts 2. If you are going to use Finn he needs to keep helping ghosts but have nothing to do with the grabber Or 3. Just make the movies about the grabber haunting new people and turn him into the new Freddie.",literal
"Maybe fun if you are also into nick cage films... I am having a hard time believing that Liam Neeson is the guy living in the US south, close to the border, carrying the American flag on his shoulder (5 min in the film) and still speaking with his infamous tone of voice and accent... I think if he hadn't been casted for this, then it would have been a completely uninteresting film. Yes it's a Liam Neeson movie...same like a Nick Cage movie...we watch it to see Liam doing something. But it's not Taken or anything like that. And it's not exactly action/thriller; 40% of the film is a subtle social commentary. I had fun watching it but come on, was that film necessary? Probably not. 5/10.",literal
"If Barbarian hooked you... Weapons will haunt you Just got back from the cinema. I loved it. My friend didn't like it, but that says more about how most people seem to expect the same predictable horror formula. This film was brave. It broke the mould in the same way Zack Cregger did with Barbarian. He's the shot of adrenaline horror has needed for years.

Instead of conventional jump scares (the jump scares in this movie were well-fashioned) Weapons plays with suspense. It's a slow burn. It pulls you along, unsettling you and leaving you curious about what's really happening. The dark comedy cuts through the tension, which weirdly makes it feel more real.

There's gore, but the real horror is psychological, more haunting than a slasher kill. The story isn't neat, and not every question gets answered. That worked for me.

Real horror thrives in the unknown, and when witches are involved, you shouldn't expect clean resolutions anyway. Strong offbeat characters, sharp dialogue, and a fantastic screenplay that dares to be different.",literal
"I loved it This was pure entertainment! I have to say, it gets better after episode 1. I LOVED the slow-motion scenes and the loud, modern music that feels completely out of place. It gives the show such a great sense of chaos and energy. The brothers' dynamic, the subtle humor, Anthony Boyle's acting... so many good things about this show.

If you're looking for something historically accurate or with music from that period, this might not be for you.

Can't wait for season 2.",literal
"not as bad as you think it is. I cant seem to understand the hate for the American version, i am a huge fan of the Original series, actually the preview for this got me into the original series! after watching the pilot of this, i can say its gonna be good, and its something America needs, besides another ""reality series"" whether you're watching the original or American remake its still a good show. however there are a few things changed in the American remake and they are very subtle changes, like Ian being interested in the military and Liam being black, those are the only huge changes. there were allot of drastic changes made to the original series which made it much better, such as getting rid of some characters and adding a bunch of new ones. lets just hope this remakes gets to live 7 seasons.",figurative
"Anyone who dismissed Task after the first episode is probably the same type who found True Detective Season 1 boring Episode 1 frames Task as a moral thriller about faith, family, and blurred lines between justice and crime - setting up Tom and Robbie as mirror opposites destined to collide.

Faith vs. Corruption Tom is a former priest turned FBI agent, torn between his past faith and present disillusionment.

Robbie claims to have a ""code"" even while committing brutal robberies, showing how morality can be twisted.

Family and Burden Both Tom and Robbie are defined by family struggles: Tom's son is in prison, fracturing his faith and identity.

Robbie is raising kids while dragging himself/them into his criminal life.

The series shows how family obligations can both ground and corrupt people.

Cycles of Violence The drug-house robberies are meant to target criminals, but they spiral into bloodshed.

Violence breeds more violence, leaving kids (like Sam) caught in the crossfire.

Moral Ambiguity Neither ""good"" nor ""bad"" characters are purely so: Tom is a priest-turned-agent wrestling with guilt and fractured faith.

Robbie is a robber who shows tenderness toward children, even while endangering them.

The show sets up a world where everyone operates in shades of gray.

Loss of Innocence Children (Ethan, Maeve, Sam) are central - each losing innocence in different ways.

Their suffering reflects how adult failures and corruption ripple down to the next generation.

All of this in 1st episode, lets see how it turns in next 6.",literal
"Gold I really enjoyed this one. Viv managed to stay true to the pilot, which is a feat in and of itself. The world of Hazbin Hotel is very entertaining and offers a different take on Christian lore, one that goes back to its roots about forgiveness and flips the usual script. Yes, it's not the first, but it offers an entertaining view and teases with its lore and character background enough to leave the viewer wanting to know more.

It is a shame, though, that only 4 episodes were realased as of this writing. I was looking forward to an entire night of binging it. This interest is niche, but those in this genre should enjoy the adult humor laced with song in this format. I know I did.

Amazon, A24, and Bento Box, you had *better* let them finish this story!",literal
"Solid nine It's a very unique series. The characters are complicated and deep, and the acting was great from every actor. It keeps sending meaningful messages to the audience. One of the best I've seen recently - I'm very happy that I watched it.

Mark ruffalo is a great underrated actor and this role well feel like it made especially for him And everyone else was really good And there's a thing i felt it might be personal but i felt like the show didn't force you to cry when bad things happened it's just happened it's a part of the story and shut happens sometimes evil just win.",literal
"Such a waste of time!! This is how the story goes. The actual story is about 10 minutes long. Then they will keep replaying the same story from five different perspectives.

Each per perspective is overly dramatic There is way too much breathing and phone calls and huffing and puffing with absolutely no intelligence while handling such a dire situation

For the amount of money that these guys are paid to work at those jobs it shows that they do not know how to handle the situation

Definitely not worth watching.",literal
"The Running Hunger Man Games The man is angry as the hulk, so they say, but he needs to start running to save his family.

This movie has a few interesting ideas and ending points but this movie just does not seem to be able to escape its meh-ness. Cutting the movie down by 20 minutes could have helped.

Needless to say, this movie is like John Wick meets Hunger games. A dystopian society where everyone can be armed to the teeth for a game show.",literal
"Definitely worth watching. I really don't understand why some people are leaving negative reviews. I actually found the acting to be very strong, and the storytelling kept me interested throughout. The characters feel real, and the pacing makes you want to keep watching. It's a well-made series that deserves more credit than it's getting. Definitely worth giving a try.""",literal
"Rounding up for the fun Sisu had me saying ""that doesn't work that way"" over and over again, but ultimately it was fun enough for me to look past it. The movie is cartoonishly violent and requires the suspension of disbelief. Nazis have become the easy go-to bad guys for showing brutal, remorseless deaths. They were played up a little bit obnoxiously bad at points, but that's so you don't feel bad when they die. The badassery was turned up a little too high for my tastes, not every character needs to be some sort of folk hero.

The acting was good, but I think the decision to make the film in English ultimately hurt the dialogue. I know they wanted a wider audience, but when your actors are forced to speak a second language they're not going to feel very natural.

I'd give it a 6.5 if I could. It's not for everyone, a lot of people will find it over the top.",literal
"Decent but falls off real fast The show is honestly a good watch if you want something light hearted. But after season 2 the show just falls of so hard, and by season 4 i couldnt watch more. Why am i watching patrol cops trying to rescue a kidnapped police officer in another country, its just to surrealistic and there is many times in all seasons it feels kinda silly. Like why are rookie patrol cops leading cia house break ins, etc.. i also just wanna point out that at times i feel like the show is just to political correct. The head of the patrol cops is just so perfect no matter whats happen'd or the tookies as doing and towards the end its kinda sickening.",literal
"This. Is. Incredible. There really aren't enough positive things to say about this potential masterpiece of art. I want to go on record as saying if the show manages to keep this quality up for it's entire run length, this will be the first show I have watched since Breaking Bad to be as close to perfection as possible.

Admittedly, things start off slow and drag slightly with the first episode. Fear not though, because Severance picks up with an increasing amount of drama and mystery, climaxing perfectly with a season finale that balances that fine line of leaving you wanted more, while quenching your appetite to remain satisfied until Season 2.

Every metric you can measure and judge a TV show on is on display with absolute mastery. The casting, acting, script, direction, cinematography, lighting, set decoration.. everything is perfect.

Actually I noticed a running theme for this review I've written is the word ""perfect"". So I'll leave you all with that, and watch the damn show already.",figurative
"Tone down the cheese If a movie wants to look like its art, then it should actually mean something. At least make sense and wrap up subplots that were left hanging. But if the writers just wanted to play around by splicing together every B-movie/popcorn-flick gimmick- then they shouldn't take themselves too seriously. A good example of genre mixing would be Kill Bill.  There is such a tongue-in-cheek, wink-wink, nudge-nudge feeling to the ultra violence, corny dialog and preposterous events (i.e. who needs physical therapy when you have will power?). Some completely unbelievable, messed-up stuff goes down in that flick. But hey, it's just a romp down grindhouse movie memory lane. I may be wrong, but I don't think that was the intent of the writers for Brotherhood of the Wolf. Basically, the tone and look was all wrong, wrong, wrong for such an ultimately low brow endeavor.

***Warning: contains spoilers***

First, it was way too long for such a cheesy mess of a film. Now I think Tarantino made the right move by splitting Kill Bill into two movies. BOTW didn't need to do that. Instead they should have cut the useless scenes, subplots that lead nowhere and the aristocratic romance. That's the second thing. Frosnac & Marianne's relationship was completely unbelievable. Sheltered, stand offish girl is the desire of every man in the province why? Because the characters said so, and the camera does close ups on her. Then this cocksure naturalist (with no aristocratic blood) waltzes in and wins her heart. So predictable -it gave me the dry heaves. But even worse was that he's like 35 and she looks like she's 16, 17 tops. Help, someone call CPS!! They should have done away with Marianne all together, and concentrated on the relationship between him and Sylvia. The intrigue and danger surrounding the witch/prostitute/undercover spy would make a much more interesting story than the banal affair with virginal Marrianne. At least it would be more believable- Frosnac looks like a dirty guy. Third- poor Mani. I had a feeling he was gonna die the second I saw him step onscreen. Following the formula, I knew someone had to be killed in order for the lead character to go ape sh!t and seek revenge- I was just hoping it would be Marrianne. (Sigh) I can't wait for Kill Bill Vol II to come out.",literal
Mindblowing This movie is an amazing and unpredictable magic trick that will keep you at the edge of your seat and guessing towards the very end.,figurative
"Excellent sit-com by the brilliant Chuck Lorre Definitely slated to be the best sitcom of this season, this is a creative and funny show. Two geeks have a beautiful girl (Penny) move to the apartment next door. The two geeks have two friends that are even geekier. Here is the many ways in which this show excels: the geeks are lovable and funny and human, not pathetic, you feel for them, the neighbor girl is a very sweet girl, and for once the characters are educated and thoughtful, not the usual ""dumb"" people we see on TV. The dynamics and the dialog between the four friends is fast paced, funny and rich with detailed observations. This is a comedy by Chuck Lorre, the guy who has created Dharma (from Dharma & Greg) so I am fully expecting Penny's character to bloom into far more than what meets the eye. The four male leads establish their personalities in the pilot with such ease that it's clear we are watching a very well written and well acted show. Kudos to the whole cast and the writers. I hope this funny, smart show stays around. We need a comedy with wit and heart, and for a change - lovable geeky brains too.",figurative
"DON'T recommend season 8 and 9 The rating's purely based on episodes before Michael leaves. As soon as he leaves the show goes rapid downhill it's almost brutal to watch. There was some pathetic and pointless attemps to replace Michael and I don't understand since when Jim have become such an ungrateful git. But up to season 7 episode 22 it's hillarious and I will always binge watch once in a while. Michael comes across complete idiot at first, but he kinda grows on you and I particularly enjoyed the friendship between Pam and Dwight.",literal
"Not A Comedy If you're thinking you are about to watch a Channing Tatum comedy, think again. The source material for this movie would have made a great ""inspired by a true story"" rather than what I suspect was a ""shot for shot"" remake of the main characters actual life. The film is 100% a drama with a handful of scenes that produce a smile or giggle. If you're into family dramas, you'll probably enjoy it, if not, steer clear of this one.",literal
"MOST INCREDIBLE SHOW ON THE PLANET This 100% is and will always be the most amazing show I've ever watched. The fact that it lasted so long AND held up after 17 years...incredible. The effects, the horror, the acting, all perfect. This show is the reason for my existence and I could not wish for it to be any better. My entire life is shaped around this story and these characters. Who cares if it doesn't have the best ending, or some seasons aren't as good. The rest of the show is amazing and beautiful. 2-3 okay seasons out of 15 is pretty d*mn good. My favorite seasons are 4 and 11, and my favorite character is Castiel. All the characters are cast perfectly, and the show is worth watching 1000 times over again. It is so good that I finished the entire thing within a year. Even after watching it a gazillion times you are still excited to watch it and see all the characters and stories. I love how it is diverse in race, culture and sexuality, it contains multiple LGBTQIA+ characters throughout the show. The characters' chemistry is so ENGAGING, and almost every main character is attractive and an amazing actor. I have 5 posters overall in my house, and my entire bedroom is themed around some of the characters, along with my sister's almost entire wardrobe. All of my and my sister's devices contain at least one background with Supernatural characters on it, and even my mom dad and grandmother are all obsessed with this show. All my aunts, most of my uncles, my other grandmother, and even some of my teachers have seen at least a season of this show. I don't understand how there are so many negative ratings and opinions about this show, as it is just so fantastic. The two brothers (eventually 3) dynamic is perfect for this show and I couldn't ask for anything more. No matter what other shows I watch(ed) could EVER compare to this, not even Stranger Things, LOTR: Rings of power, the Mandalorian, The Vampire diaries, Buffy, Bones, Fate: The Winx Saga---the list goes on forever.

Amazing. Phenomenal. Astonishing. Beautiful. Fantastic. Incredible.

Those are all words to describe this show, and they don't even come close to describing how good it is.",literal

Fantastic absurdist show leaving behind old formulas and creating a new less cynical but still edgy enough mixture of surprising and extreme but very smart comedy.",literal
Nice idea but The Highlight is actress Toni Colette. The other actors still need to grow and reach her level. The kids were acting better then mr. And mrs.dempsey... They director managed to keep tension from Episode to Episode but the story is just lacking in complexity. But obviously it hits all the gender buttons. Still this is not the only requirement for a good movie.,literal
"From Great To Predictable At first, I rated Yellowstone a solid 9, but as the seasons progressed, I felt compelled to lower that score. The first two seasons were nearly flawless, but the storyline gradually became more predictable, leaving little room for surprises or fresh twists.

When it comes to the characters, I found Jamie and Beth to be misrepresented, seemingly shaped to fit a modern feminist narrative. Beth, portrayed as a symbol of female strength, felt overly idealized and unrealistically invincible. On the other hand, Jamie's character arc was the most frustrating of all - depicted as a weak, toxic man who constantly loses to Beth. It felt like the writers stripped him of all complexity. He grew up on a ranch, graduated from Harvard, yet somehow remains hopelessly inferior to every woman he encounters.

Despite these issues, Yellowstone is still worth watching for its breathtaking atmosphere, stellar acting, and gorgeous cinematography. The soundtrack perfectly captures the Western vibe, adding an extra layer of immersion to the experience.",literal
"You Look Like a Christmas Super Villain."" A lot can be said about the ""Roofman,"" but I'm just going to say that in the words of Kendrick Lamar, ""Love's gonna get you down, but pride's gonna be the death of you,"" Jeffrey or John. He's an incredibly smart person when it comes to planning a heist or fooling everyone around him into thinking that he isn't that bad of a guy. In his own defense, ""He was never good at hurting or killing anyone,"" and generally tried to avoid it at all costs. The film makes it extremely clear who you should be rooting for, but sometimes it feels weird rooting for the absolute menace that our ""Roofman"" is. However, Channing Tatum makes this a little easier with natural charisma and a well-developed and extremely convincing portrait of the anti-hero. Along with an all-star supporting cast-Kristen Dunst, Peter Dinklage, and Ben Mendelssohn-the film takes you on the scenic route through Jeff's life: losing, gaining, finding, and ultimately starting it all over again. But did he learn a thing? Intentions are everything in this film, but intentions mean very little to the authorities or his broken household. And he gives up his lead to the idea of something he can never have, and I think he knew that. But, all considered, it's a great lesson in pride's endeavors and a well-deserved win for the whole cast in a well-played-out story and a reminder of good writing in this well-done story of the infamous ""Roofman."" The early 2000s setting also helps this one win a spot in my top three for the year of 2025.",figurative

"Amazing acting, breathtaking scenes and an overall addictive show! This is my first ever review on IMDb, and I felt ""Poldark"" was the right place to start. It had me hooked from the very first episode, and Anne Dudley's theme certainly played a big part in that.

But let me start by saying what, in my opinion, stood out the most, after now having binge-watched all 8 episodes in two days. In a sea of overly sexualised period/fantasy dramas, this one is refreshingly ""pure"", yet by no means lacking chemistry or passion. There might be the occasional shirtless Aidan Turner, and yet the fact that he has proved himself an incredibly talented actor, able to express a thousand emotions with his eyes, ensures that he is not turned into eye-candy. In fact, all actors have done an amazing job in this, and it is their portrayal of highly relatable characters that makes ""Poldark"" interesting and addictive. Add to that a gripping plot, breathtaking photography and realistic portrayal of the era and you end up with this spectacular series.

Curled up with a hot cup of coffee, ""Poldark"" will certainly make you smile, situations and characters will frustrate you and some will even break your heart, but above all it will give you the feeling that you are watching something worthwhile! I haven't read the books, but I am certainly planning to, especially since I can't wait to find out what will happen to the characters...",literal
"Great I don't even have much to say here, I guess. It's a great show. If you want drama as in ""complicated relationships"" it's probably not for you, even though there is some. It focuses on actual medicine, and when feelings are at play - they are related to what's actually happening, the stress of it all and the toll that stress can have on a person.

Pacing is amazing here. There is lots of stuff going on every minute, and yet the whole season is just 1 day (technically less). If you watch this show and you do not start appreciating what doctors and nurses have to go through on daily basis - you are just a bad person.

Can't wait for 2nd season.",figurative
"Great show, saved many nights and rainy weekends I was not so into fire department series. But this series great. An anchor in volatile times.

"Woefully brilliant I walked into watching this thinking it was going to be great, bring back some much loved childhood memories and amaze me. Jenna Ortega managed to make Wednesday into a far more interesting character and her recital on the rooftop was brilliant not to mention the Nothing Else Matters overture at times.

Even if you have never watched the original material, anyone can pick this show up and have a woefully great time. Thing for example manages to amuse, entertain and leave questions ""Where the hell is the rest of him?"" not to mention ""How do they get Thing to be alive?""

Well worth watching and I look forward to more.",figurative
"what a delight! Wow, what a great great movie! The visuals in this movie are breathtaking!! They are so gorgeous!

The chemistry between Moana and Maui is so great and so natural. The songs in this movie are so charming, catchy and fun! But, How Far I'll Go is such an emotional song and it has such heart...I dare say I like it a little more than Let It Go! The way Moana sings it and you can feel it!!

"Missing Facts As a fellow addict, this show does not represent reality at all. I suppose most of the audience will enjoy this and I have to say I do enjoy this, but the glaring mistakes it makes stick out to me like tiny sore toes.

For example, once hooked on morphine, you don't just wake up your happy self the very next day without it. Withdrawals are not your friend and a pretty evident and severe thing, You just don't go cold turkey off of opioids without suffering. Once a day dosing just isn't a thing. People need to dose many times a day, at least 3 or 4 times to keep an even keel. Jackie would actually be visiting pill mills or many different doctors to keep up her habit.

The habit is not gradual. You don't start off with one and gradually go up. It is like 1, one day and then 5 the next and then 10, then you invent ways to get it into you quicker and stronger like crushing pills, snorting crushed pills, injecting it. Oh and yes injecting will get you there faster than drinking morphine from a vial. She is a nurse and supposedly knows this. Drinking it means going thru your digestive system before hitting the circulatory system when injecting it puts it there quicker and stronger. You lose some ingesting it.

Just pointing out some basics. I suppose you don't need to be a former user to know some of these things but they were glaring to me.

Yes I am picking this apart because I think the creators should have done more research.",literal
"Best scripted show on Network TV I was skeptical when I heard of an origin show but I was wrong. This show is consistently excellent. The writing and acting are spot on, the peripheral characters grow on you by the third episode (loved Lala from the start). Of course it's darker, the aftermath of Gibb's tragedy isn't going to be a laugh fest. It isn't superficial like many shows and show's how he became who he was, more than a plot backstory. I loved the story about Ruth his landlady. And Cecilia's fate was preordained when he said this is her story, I was saddened by her fate.

I retired from the Navy in '96 and as someone who dealt with the NIS ( and JAG) during my time in Hawaii in the late 80's, early 90's it is interesting to see the agency in the iteration that I recall before Tailhook had the Navy scrambling for damage control.

The original NCIS show has become lightweight and comfortable with weak cases and stories. This is a real drama and character study. NCIS Hawaii had also really become an enjoyable show with plenty of ohana spirit, but CBS cut it while chasing dollars and cost effective shows. For those who complain it's too dark or deep, stand by Tony and Ziva will be up right up your alley.",literal
"Cinema Lives Run, run, run, and give the people a good show while you're at it. One of the most engaging theater experiences I've had this year, Running Man is a buffet table of cardio, comedy, explosions, and bullets. In this world where the gap between the rich and powerful and the hopeless and broke is very apparent, it holds a mirror up to the audience in a way that's relatable to some. Will I pay rent? Or pay for my kid's medicine? Etc.

The harsh and whacky nature of this film, where salvation seems unreachable, introduces a corrupt elite who comes in as an olive branch, with his own harsh and whacky nature offering a new lease on life to our poverty-stricken protagonist - but no promises. However, the show must go on by any means necessary.

You can practically smell the gunpowder and rage throughout this 2-hour and 13-minute runtime. With an all-star cast that delivers amazing performances, as an audience member you are glued to the screen, just like the citizens within the film, fixated on the fate of our hero. Every moment is visually captivating, and the bursts of humor are perfectly timed, offering relief amid the intensity of this action-packed sci-fi thriller. Running Man works as a fun standalone experience, though revisiting the original may add even more depth and context.",literal
"Healing across time Sentimental Value reflects Joachim Trier's Norwegian cultural environment while exploring the psychology of generational trauma. With nuance and compassion, the film shows how parents' choices reverberate through their children's lives, shaping identity and memory.

It triggered long conversations with my wife about our own lives and efforts to raise our children in a supportive and loving environment through both happy and challenging times.",literal

"Countertransference While there is inevitable oversimplification, this film is essentially accurate as to events. Dr. Kelley was of a time when psychiatry had precious little scientific substance. One had to be a bit of a trickster and charlatain, as he was. The flagrance of the Hippocratic oath violations is cringeworthy.

This film certainly has something cogent to say about our time. For about 20 years after WWII, the most respected history books described a German national character set apart from the rest of humanity. Dr. Kelley was essentially cancelled for contravening that pervading conventional wisdom. Now, when the facists advance without the tipoff of scary uniforms just as he foresaw, he is vindicated. Important events do depend on flawed people. Important things do happen for fortuitous, inpredictable, foolish reasons. This film imparts that lesson well.

I watched Nuremberg (2000). The present film does cover important stuff that film left out. That one left Dr. Kelley out while including Dr. Gilbert. This one does the reverse. Just sayin'.",literal
"Solid 7/10 for the first 2 seasons The characters and dialogue in the 1st two seasons were not sensational, but it was the only US cop show i can recall watching and enjoying in a long time.

Unfortunately, season 3 went completely off the rails with the victimhood politics and misandry. New characters are caricatures, literally all of them. Calling them cardboard cutouts would be an insult to cardboard. And dialogue seems to be written by ChatGPT trained solely on buzfeed articles.

It's criminal to let such great cast and characters that were developed over the course of 2 seasons go to waste. Maybe it gets better later on? Who knows? I certainly don't care.",figurative
"dreaming I've read all the comments that preceded this one. Some folks liked the movie and some folks panned it. However, only one or two posts touched on what I thought was the most adult theme of the movie. After many comedic attempts to outwit The Beast, Scotty Small dreams about a giant baseball pile-driving him into the ground. However, Benny has a dream featuring the ""great Bambino."" When Babe Ruth visited Benny in his dream, he imparted the advice that Benny had to decide if he were going to face his fear or not. Benny could hardly wait. He was up early, urging Scotty to get dressed and get to the ""sandlot."" When the gang gathered, all the boys were trying to dissuade Benny from going into the Beast's yard to retrieve the autographed ball, but Benny looked at Scotty and said ""I have to,"" whereupon he attempted and succeeded.

Don't' we all at some point in our lives have to make the decision to try or to give up? I thought the writers and directors made good use of conflict and resolution throughout the movie from Benny's rescue of Scotty Small's angst from being the nerdy ""new kid"" to the rescue of the Beast from beneath the fence.

We all had friends in our youth who are represented in part by the movie's characters. That's why it is and will remain a ""feel good"" movie. It reminds all of us of our own youth and of the good memories we have of those times.",literal
"Guys watch it too As a guy, I'm a little shy about admitting how much I like this show. But the idea of a solider who fought against the American War for Independence who then comes home and builds back his life is fascinating. I'd actually like more focus on the mining and the business aspects and less romance. But overall, what an incredible show!",literal
"Loved it When I watch TV, I just look to be entertained, hopefully with engrossing story lines that are well acted and well produced. I do not need moralistic platitudes shoved down my throat, just entertain me. I do not need to see an ""Oscar"" worthy TV show. Just entertain me for an hour and help me relieve the stress factors of everyday life and make me forget for an hour that I have to get that laundry done or pack that lunch or write those checks. ""Calgon, take me away."" This show delivers. To all the people comparing it to the movie, I've seen the movie too. It was definitely awesome. So is this show. Apples and Oranges.",figurative
"An intense, slow burning drama It's just something special in the way Jennifer Lawrence can play persons who slowly drift into chaos. We saw it in the restaurant scene in Passengers, in half of the second part of Mother! And now here, in full length. The camera can just show her face and you see something die or explode in her head just by looking at her, watching her eyes and noticing the microexpressions of her face. It's a joy. Also a joy is how devoted and natural she is in this role. Pattinson plays well too, but it's obvious who the star in this drama is. Add to this the constant switches in the timeline, the classic 4:3 format, which add a claustrophobic feeling to it. This movie is slow, repetitive and irritating, as you watch the disfunctioning couple fall deeper into the trap of their own relationship, adding error after adding to it, while the character Lawrence plays can within a microsecond switch from a catatonic state to an explosion. This movie is not for everyone. It may also feel like a waste of time. It just tells the story of how this relationship fell apart. Nothing more, nothing less. It's no horror drama, no action. But it might be the best performance of Jennifer Lawrence we got so far.",figurative
"The show is fizzling out at a rapid speed. This show used to reach new heights till season 6 , post that it became it took a down slide. The season 9 premier was such a drag that I started chatting on my phone while watching the episode.

That says it all. Chuck Lorre should consider this his last season he should not even think of season 10. I am sad to see Howard reduced to a henpecked husband. His comic timing is kick-ass if used wisely.

I hope the story builds up nicely in the season 9 for the finale season 

I think that's where Friends scored more, because for all the seasons they were constant through out.

Each character got enough story line. In this series it's like all about Leonard and Penny and Sheldon.",literal
"Task is Redemption What makes Task stand out is its emotional depth. Beyond the suspense and action, it dives into guilt, loyalty, and the gray space between right and wrong. Ruffalo's performance is powerful and understated, while Tom Pelphrey shines as a desperate man caught between family and crime.

Visually, the show's muted tones and raw realism make every frame feel authentic and lived-in. Though its pacing can feel slow at times, that deliberate tempo allows the story's emotional weight to fully land.",figurative
"The best The Sopranos is the best show ever, I liked the storyline, the characters and the timeline absolutely beautiful and amazing, Especially Tony Soprano, One of my favourite character of all time.

"We shall see... I remember watching the original ""Law & Order""; I was shocked that they are bringing it back, continues where the last season has been taken - it's unusual they did it, and usually it doesn't happens often, that once they revive it, it usually goes back to the first season, but not this one (lol)...we shall see of this version, how long it will last, and hopefully they will bring some ""appearances"" back from the original's!!!! :o :)",literal

"We're All Sinners! An absolute masterclass of directing and acting on display here. It's just so cool to see to Micheal B Jordan's and how different they are to each other as well, very nicely done. Truly, every actor holds there own, and are captivating to watch. It was also exciting to see new talent on the big screen, and I'm sure we'll see this cast in many more things to come.

Now this is definitely a vampire movie and a fun, and spooky one at that but there's also deep and beautiful messaging here about religion and music and that I think that'll be audiences biggest takeaway. Last thing, there's a sequence in the middle of this movie, and you'll know the one and it is simply incredible. Honestly the best movie of 2025 so far, go watch it!",literal
"The hive mind concept is interesting, but that's about it I don't get the inflated rating, it's an okay series, really stretched out, with very little character development or anything of much going on in the long running episodes (so far 3 are out), hopefully it will improve but I wouldn't hold my breath.

Also it's not sure to the maker what they want the tone of the series to be, at times it's comedy, at times (though very little of it) it's thriller, but mostly it's a drama. Multi genre series have worked, the expanse had pretty diverse genre throughout it's running seasons, however it doesn't really work in this one.",literal
"Wow.. its like my favorite show of all time all over again This is ER on steroids, I can't believe they did it and brought back my fav tv doc of all time!

I'm ecstatic!

I'm only 1 episode in and this is getting better by the minute, it's the first time I'm so happy that I'm 42 and have had the privilege to watch ER and now we get this gem.

Only thing that could make this better is adding the OG ER into theme.

Noah waily is charming, his character is much less dark that I thought they would make him, there's no non-cringy way of saying this but he's like an older, more mature and evolved Dr. Carter.

I wish I could see the look on his face when he got a call to show up for this role.",figurative
"Incredible! Reminds me a lot of some of my favourite movies from a while ago, such as ""Kubo and the two strings"" for the demon/magic aspect of it and all the pinks and blues, as well as the animation style. I might be slightly biased BC I love K-pop but the soundtrack was awesome, don't know many movies with better original songs, and a very inventive and powerful storyline. It's not often I feel really moved by movies, especially animated ones like this, but I think the message really hit home for me and I guess this was just one of those movies that happened to be right up my alley, with the themes, culture, music, and the passion that I know went into this film. Overall, a brilliant movie, would 100% recommend to anyone, even if they aren't a fan of K-pop or animated movies, because this one is something else. Again, my opinion may be slightly biased since I happen to be THE target audience, but still a great movie with lots of upbeat tracks that get you bopping to the rhythm. Congrats Sony, you've done it again.",literal
"The Sandlot The main character's name was not Steve... if you have seen this movie more than once, or for more than 30 minutes, you'd realize the protagonist's name was Scotty Smalls. This movie is indeed a classic, a timeless piece accessible by all. If you love or have ever had a deep passion for baseball, this movie will move you like no other film has ever moved you before. I like to have a few too many beers and watch it through myself... the ending scene where the narrator (Scotty Smalls) tells the stories of how everyone eventually left the sandlot, and town for that matter, brings me to tears. One of the greatest movies of our era and a sure classic for not only us, but our kids as well.",literal
"It's not a mockumentary Relieved it's not another mockumentary. ""St. Denis"" is filling that void just fine (and if you haven't watched it, please give it a shot. Truly an unexpected delight.).

Happy to see Molly Kearney land on her feet after Lorne inexplicably cut her after two seasons. Always happy to see actors given an early exit from SNL succeed in prime time and movies. Someone, please retire that old, joyless hack.

Not the greatest pilot, but the potential is there. Great cast, lots of talent. Love that they hid Tim Meadows from the early ads that I myself dissed as ""who would watch this?"" Turns out it's more of a ""Superstore"" - one of the quietly charming workplace comedy successes with an ensemble cast that survived sans faux-documentary shtick.

The clientele was not exaggerated - entitled dudes showing up with the wrong documents and throwing fits are a sadly amusing thing.

Here's to hoping the network gives DMV time to develop and find its groove.",figurative
"Appalling television The standard of streaming platform dramas is at a high level. Shows such as Department Q, Slow Horses, This City is Ours, Kin, and Down Cemetery Road (to name a few) have set the bar high.

This doesn't get to the bar. In fact, the people who made this show don't even know the bar exists.

This is nothing more than a daytime TV show with the acting and production quality of a true crime drama from a budget network. Why Michael Peña and Dakota Fanning put their name to this is beyond me. The writing, the cinematography, the acting, the production - it's also atrocious.

At times it meanders without purpose. At other times it's just relentless scenes of domestic unrest. The only character you can even remotely empathise with is Peña and his son. None of the characters are remotely likeable.

The storyline is deeply unimpressive (when things actually happen other than arguing and crying).

How this has 77% on Rotten Tomatoes and over 7/10 on IMDB is genuinely beyond me.",literal
"No essence I recently watched this movie, and to be honest, I'm struggling to understand the purpose behind it. From start to finish, it felt like the entire experience was built almost entirely around dialogue, yet those conversations rarely carried any real weight or depth. A film can absolutely thrive on dialogue alone when it's sharp, meaningful, or layered with subtext, but here it felt shallow, repetitive, and ultimately unconvincing.

The characters spend so much time talking, but what they're saying doesn't seem to move the story forward or reveal anything profound about who they are. Instead, it feels like words for the sake of words-long exchanges that might have been aiming for philosophical or emotional depth but fell flat. Without strong dialogue, the movie doesn't have much else to lean on, because there isn't really a compelling plot, standout visuals, or a strong atmosphere to carry the gaps.

Movies built around minimal action and heavy dialogue can be powerful when done well, but this one left me unmoved. It's not that I expect explosions or constant action, but I do expect substance. Unfortunately, this movie just didn't deliver, and I walked away more frustrated than entertained.",literal
"Top 3 TV show anywhere This show blew my expectations out of the water! It is excellent in every way, especially where 90% of current shows lack most good qualities. Jeremy Renner just proves he is an elite actor, and deserves full recognition! The acting ALL AROUND is flawless, from 15+ characters! Let show that had that was Man in High Castle and 24. The plot is realistic, gritty, and never predictable. It does what few shows, show a surreal and realistic pictures of the depravity of men and their sin nature, how man treats his fellow, and how fools reap their folly. Mike plays a Christian peacemaker, even though he makes no claim to be one. The show gives Mira lessons every episode, of virtues and vices, of principles and temptations, and every life ""is a series of choices"" as the Mom says. I LOVE the character Mike exemplifies, which is not found in any other show or recent movie. Cons: Too much profanity and far too graphic depiction of violent gore when the viewer can easily decipher what is about to happen Ex: the dog getting balls cut!

Antoine Fuqua is a top notch director who deserves TOP respect!!!",literal
"Another Vacation Film That Is Very Accurate ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"" is not quite as good as the original, but is a hundred times better than the second installment (""European Vacation"").  This time Chevy Chase, Beverly D'Angelo, and their kids decide to stay at home and have the whole family over for the holidays. Of course nothing goes as planned and the whole thing turns into a disaster.  Randy Quaid, Juliette Lewis, E.G. Marshall, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and Brian Doyle Murray all add great moments of comedy as supporting players.  The direction and screenplay are solid.  Everything seems to come together fine in this one.  3.5 out of 5 stars.",figurative
"the story wasn't ready I feel like Mae Martin bit more than they could chew. Their acting was really bad, especially next to Toni Collette, who is phenomenal, as always. The writing was also just halfway there. I think I understand what Martin tried to achieve. What I don't understand is why Netflix put the show out there half baked. The story has potencial, it could have been a great tv show - even if Mae Martin still insisted to cast themself in the leading role.",literal
"Season 21 I was really looking forward to this original Law & Order returning. But, I'm beyond disappointed. The characters are just not likable, and the writing is awful. The new DA is a self absorbed person who always thinks he'd right, and Sam Waterson's character doesn't really challenge him, and just gives in. Jeff Donovan's character is the worst. Jeff was terrific in Burn Notice. In this, he comes off as an nasty cop with a really bad attitude, and a bigot to boot. Time to fire the writing staff and do some recasting.",literal
"Wow!! From episode 1 all the way to the end. Watched the first season in one night. Paid for it the next day at work but it was totally worth it. Billy Bob really brings it in Landman and John Ham is great. Ali looks like she got even hotter!! Show is really fast paced. Not a lot of filler his great writing. Only down side is the is only one season available right now. I was hooked after 10 min into the show. I didn't want to watch it but wife did so we did and I am so glad we did. The cast did a phenomenal job. I don't know who is writing this show but who ever they are they are frigging awesome!! Love this show and cannot wait for next season. Billy Bob, Demi Moore and John Ham!! You will not be disappointed.",literal
"Glad I ignored the sceptics Enjoying this very much so far - of course it's not the Original, so it lacks a fair bit of Originality (like the replacement cast of Horrible Histories, come to think of it, but so far much better than that disappointment). Starting strong with well-developed parallels to many of the original characters, bouncy dialogue and gags, so I'm cheerfully ploughing through batches of these short episodes with great content and lots of chuckles. Of course I prefer Lady Fanny to her Henry Jamesian counterpart and know there could never have been a substitute Captain, but it seems already that superficially-cheery Scout-ish masters and sleezy yuppies are the same in the afterlife everywhere. Quality Viking contribution, although I'm perplexed ay his fixation with cod rather than herring so far. A great Jazz age diva and a Native American wiseguy are promising and I'm looking forward to more of lovechild Flower and alternative founding Father Isaac too. An American adaptation of a BBC original that really hasn't got it wrong at all.",literal
"the problem for me.......... the problem for me was some little things.having worked in various offices I can tell you Americans don't act so mousy or reserved and nervous as shown on the American version. 

it may seem right how English people are but not Americans. also, sometimes a boss sets the tone for an office. and seeing how he is such a clown, it baffles me how people would be so reserved in his office.

there were some bright spots, but the British version was so good that its hard for me to get over it and accept this version even though I am American and want to like it. I will give it a shot though.I need to find a good series to watch and seeing as I thought the original office ended way too soon, cripes after only 2 seasons??come on!",literal

"To those giving 2/10 stars, shame on you. I couldnt be happier with how this pilot was done. I'm seeing people posting reviews saying the plot makes no sense, or things are unclear. It's very difficult for me to understand how people arent seeing this? I only recently became aware of this project and I have not been kept in the loop and ai figured this out pretty fast.

I do thin they released to much promotional material, however when your working on a fan funded project, you need to keep the interest alive to keep the $$$ flowing. Especially when projects like this take years to complete.

I really love the idea of the plot and rehabbing demons to be better, and honestly each character has so much individuality and I love that. Each character has it's own set of sound FX that are essentially part of the characters themselves. I honestly thought I was watching a professional studio made production.

 To those leaving bad reviews for such silly reasons, shame in you. Stop being an edgy critic and try to sit down and enjoy something in your life. To seriously give 2/10???? The show literally explains why people are being exterminated among other plot points people are claiming arent mentioned. Pay attention if it's that difficult for you to figure out then fund another show. Again, I just discovered this and understood everything pretty easily. Not only that but they are running off of a shoe string budget. Seriously lighten up.",literal
"Good background show Pretty good for a medical show. Lots of accurate things, but waayyyyyy too much exposition at times. Doesn't sound like natural dialogue.

I've worked in hospitals and clinics for a long time and the way these characters speak and act is very unrealistic. Lots of political issues brought up, and whether you're on one side or the the other, it can pull you out of the show.

Some of the characters are really unlikeable...which is fine I suppose, but just fyi. Dr. Collin's is the worst character...imo. Don't like this actresses work in the show. Entertaining for sure, but some unlikable things. Mid overall.",literal
"When Carol Breaks Bad (But Not in a Good Way) I started watching Plurabus mostly because I'm a huge Vince Gilligan fan, and of course, because it's set in my hometown of Albuquerque. But aside from the gorgeous scenery, this show is tough to get through, largely because of the main character, Carol, who comes across as a stereotypical Karen, a middle-class, entitled woman. I'm three episodes in and about a third of the way through and nothing substantial has really happened yet.

I'm hoping the next episode has Carol breaking her bad mood, because at this pace, I'm afraid I'll end up breaking up with a bad show.",literal
"Fantastic and harrowing to watch Few dramas have been cast so perfectly to deepen and benefit the story. Dark and, at times, hard to watch. I was completely engrossed in the characters and each of their sagas as they entwined and then unfolded. Justin Bateman and Jude Law have you convinced they are brothers in the greatest and most tragic sense.

Such a great series. Deserves higher ratings than it has received.",literal
So good Amazing details. Storytelling telling is great. Narrators are perfect.apparently I need 230 more words... I'm not long-winded. This is really good. Should be watched by all to know how this thing called the United States came to be. 70 more letters. George Washington was the man. 21 more words. Now seven.,literal
"Multiple flaws I'm a bit surprised by the glowing, high reviews of ""Weapons"". For me, a drama works by suspending belief, and there are enough nonsensical things in this script to make that not possible. The script needed another rewrite, with a better editor. For example:

-17 kids disappear from their homes in the middle of the night, one of the crimes of the century, and we're shown scenes of police tracker dogs searching fruitlessly for them. Yet we learn later that all the kids walked that night to the same house in the town - so why on earth wouldn't the tracker dogs have found them? It should have been one of the easiest jobs imaginable for a tracker dog.

-The one kid in his school class who didn't disappear, Alex, and his parents, are, of course, subjects of intense interest by investigators in this case. Yet no one - not the families of the parents, nor their neighbors nor the police, notice that they've sealed themselves inside their house and gone catatonic, not even collecting their newspapers or mail. It takes an addict burglar to be the first one to notice this and knock on their door! Nonsense.

-One of the fathers of the missing figures out how to triangulate the location of the kids - and the investigators working 24/7 on the case wouldn't have come up with this?? C'mon...

-A policeman and his cruiser park for what, 12 hours or more, outside of a house, without ever reporting in or returning to the station, and no other cops come to check on him. Really??

-Finally, we've seen kids lured by a witch into a basement before... Straight out of ""Blair Witch Project"".

The direction, filming and the acting were great, but the flawed script keeps the film from high marks for me.",literal
"Fantastic! The songs are loooovely, the animation is wonderful, the characters are darling <3

There may be a point that the storyline isn't very slow and calm, but I understand that point of view considering how much corporations, especially Netflix and Prime, cancel good shows. I can see why the creators may have wanted to cover vast storylines in episodes. And to be really honest, its actually been pretty entertaining and fun! The fast paced plot keeps you intrigued, and it doesn't seem rushed, just very amusing!

Essentially, just quite a good show in general. Keeps you very entertained and interested and delighted in general.

Can't wait for more!",literal

"Surprisingly good! Okay, so I started watching this while isolating due to covid - going into the show with zero expectations. I really enjoyed it and am now watching it a second time having talked my husband into watching. We are really enjoying it. And I gotta say, whoever wrote that FaceTime scene with Joey - you got me twice! I was just in tears. The writing is good - gets the story told but in an emotional and efficient way. I've liked a lot of Stallone's past works - but for some reason I wasn't expecting a lot from this show. But here I sit at 6 am watching for the second time. I may have to check out Yellowstone now.

I'd give Tulsa King a 10, but we haven't made it to the end yet have we? I'm expecting to love it, though.",literal
"Maybe not a wow show but what a hella of a enjoyable Ride Danes and Rhys are an electric scene-chewing duo. WOW. In fact, every cast memeber in every scene matched or complimented Danes/Rhys's intensity.

I binge watched The Beast in Me in one day.",figurative
"Predictable and surprisingly unemotional Was McKenna Grace up to the task of starring in Regretting You, a film based on the Colleen Hoover novel? I have to say no, unless you like your family dramas to feel like just another movie-of-the-weak, pun intended. The film, whose themes are loss, betrayal and grief, fails to wring any true emotional reaction from the audience. When you're looking forward to the appearance of co-stars Lexie (Sam Morelos) and Efren (Ethan Costanilla), more than the scenes between stars Allison Williams as Morgan Grant and Dave Franco as Jonah Sullivan, your film might be in trouble.

Each actor seems to just bounce back from tragic, unexpected losses of a husband, sister, wife-to-be, best friend. Each display some deep well of acceptance that doesn't seem reality-based. It's as if everyone in the story is afraid to be angry. Perhaps that's because for 17 years, both Morgan and Jonah have ghost-walked through the roles they thought they were assigned - long suffering, just be nice, don't rock the boat. That's part of the twist, so I won't reveal it here.

As Miller Adams, the young man who wins the heart of Clara Grant (Grace), I appreciated Mason Thames' attempts to pull a human reaction out of Clara. The scenes which included Grace and Clancy Brown as Hank, Adam's ailing grandfather, were also well-meant and temporarily elevated the movie. However, it soon sunk back into mundanity. Clara Grant's dad is dead, as is Morgan Grant's husband, yet neither of the women seem to exhibit depression or anger. Apparently the well-documented Kubler-Ross five stages of grief were not included in the script. When the highest form of grief a parent reaches is grounding their kid, I'd say the might merit a visit from a social worker, a discussion with the school counselor, at the very least.

Did I hate Regretting You? No. It is simply unremarkable. Hoovers most recent book-to-screen adaption of It Ends With Us, which dealt with themes of conflict and spousal abuse, was infinitely more watchable.",literal
"Mischief, robbery, and toys Roofman isn't one of the most grand nor creative movies I have seen in the crime comedy genre, but Derek Cianfrance's direction on the atmosphere, the chemistry between the characters, and approach does still offer some fun and unique moments within the story.

The story about a criminal hiding in Toys R Us is an interesting idea, with the fact it's based on the true story of Jeffrey Manchester, makes it quite fascinating. Throughout, the camerawork and production is good. Alongside with some pretty good editing choices and direction style that Cianfrance applies with the setting. What Cianfrance is good with is establishment and approaches on tone, making it clear what the film is going for and what it wants to discuss.

All of the performances are pretty good. Channing Tatum provides a pretty funny and emotional performance to his character, as well with the rest of the cast members. The writing does have some good aspects, but ultimately, it does fall under some crime tropes and cliches, which made the second act pretty uneventful and at times, the characters weren't really interesting nor connectable as the movie hopes for. Alongside with some really weird clunky dialogue choices and certain concept aspects feeling a bit underutilized.

Overall, it's a decent movie, but I don't think I would see it again soon.",literal
"Enjoy it but also disappointing Been looking forward too this show for a while. Watched a couple of episodes today. It's a good story, decent actors & the scenery is excellent. What disappoints me is the modern take of putting modern music in a historical show. Hip hop & up beat tunes have no place in a series set in the 19 century. It completely ruin the feel of the historical time.",literal
"Entertaining 80s action movie Set in the dystopian ""future"" of 2017/18 the USA has become a dictatorship. To keep the people distracted the TV produces and airs sadistic game shows in which people get tortured to win money. Running Man, the prime time game show, gives prisoners an opportunity to fight for their freedom. Literally.

But once Arnold is ""cast"" to participate on the show you know it's the last episode of ""Running Man"".

Losely based on the novel ""Running Man"" written by Richard Bachman (aka Stephen King) it only keeps the protagonists name and the premise of dystopian version of the USA. Entertaining, but without depth.

Also I highly recommend to read the novel as well. Way more intensive than this movie could have ever been.",literal
"Postpartum, it ain't ""Die My Love"" follows young couple Grace and Jackson (Jennifer Lawrence and Robert Pattinson), who relocate to Jackson's rural hometown in Montana for a new start. The couple soon welcome the birth of a son, but their relationship splinters as Grace descends into severe mental illness, while an often emotionally-absent Jackson falters in supporting her.

This emotionally exhausting film by Lynne Ramsay (no stranger to darkness) is a psychological rollercoaster that, despite lacking in some exposition, is no less an effective, turbulent, and abstract journey into one individual's mental decline. Many have characterized this film as one about postpartum depression, but I believe this is both an oversimplification and a mischaracterization. As someone whose lifelong best friend has suffered from inconsistently-medicated bipolar disorder for decades, I found that this film succinctly illustrated exactly what this disorder looks like to a level that is uncanny. Grace's temperament and actions throughout reminded me so much of my friend that I found the film at times extremely difficult to watch.

In terms of story, ""Die My Love"" is fairly sparse. The film mostly consists of a push-and-pull, a chaotic dance between Grace and Jackson that is both exasperating and occasionally touching. There remains a clear sense that, despite their respective flaws and problems, the two deeply care for each other; however, there is a vortex in the room consuming Grace that goes unchecked for far too long. Grace's reality is entirely obfuscated by her illness, while a distracted Jackson is ill-equipped to be a source of legitimate support. His mother, Pam (Sissy Spacek), who is experiencing her own grief, seems to intuitively recognize the emotional forces that are consuming Grace, but her efforts also remain limited due to a number of interpersonal family dynamics.

The storytelling here employs nonlinear and abstract tactics that are, for the most part, effective. I do think it suffers from a lack of exposition, as the audience gets no real sense of who these people were before Grace's decline. Instead, we are dropped into their lives at the precipice of all this turmoil. A few details about Grace's past eventually emerge near the film's conclusion, but it feels like a case of ""too little, too late."" Perhaps this was done intentionally so as to mimic the unpredictable, hard-and-fast progression of some mental illnesses, but I still felt as though there was an undergirding to the two leads characters that was sorely missed. Despite this, both Lawrence and Pattinson's performances are outstanding, and Spacek serves as a warm (albeit often helpless) maternal figure between the two.

There is a repetitive nature to the events that unfold as the film hurls toward its conclusion which some may find a slog to get through (and I do think it could have benefitted from some slight editing), but I mainly found it a slog because it was a painful and dispiriting viewing experience. Given my experiences with Ramsay's other films, I expected this, but it hit me harder because it brought up many personal memories. Despite what flaws it may have, as an emotional portrait, it is a real gut-punch of a film. 7/10.",figurative
"Amazing underrated series I cant remember the last show or movie i reviewed but this one is a masterpiece. And the 7.3 or something overall score is a crime imo. Total number of episodes is 6, 1 hour each which makes it a great weekend binger. The start of the show seems very cliche and totally predictable but still pretty funny and entertaining but as the episodes go on we get to see all the characters shed their skin and their layers. Every character is unique but still you can sympathize with by the end though the manager Armond is my favorite. And every character's gets to enjoy a bittersweet ending. Phenomenal writing.",figurative
"Worth a look! I first checked this show in September 2010 and I was slowly becoming addicted. Now I am waiting for a second season and actually counting days. This such a little show, but totally politically incorrect which makes it unique. One of my favourites. Makes you laugh hard and even cry sometimes. Another great thing aside from great writing is an excellent acting. No wonder Laura Linney won a Golden Globe this January for her character. I loved Phyllis Sommerville and Oliver Platt too. Not to mention young Gabriel Basso as Adam. Also the guest stars Gabourney Sidibe, Idris Elba & even Cynthia Nixon made such a great work here.

Check it out guys!",literal
"This show is absolutely wonderful!!! I absolutely love this show! The characters are full of character and feeling and sense and everything that is in the best shows!!! The story lines are totally believable and there are sad parts, funny parts, intense moments, and refreshing insights...just everything I love in a great show. There are enough surprises to keep you guessing, but enough stability to keep me coming back to watch the next episode. This is truly an absolutely wonderful show! I cannot wait for the next season to begin and my daughter loves it too. All my co-workers love the show too and we watch it and look forward to discussing all the parts the next day at work! This show is irresitable...so if you haven't watched the first season...you should try to rent it or watch the re-runs (if they ever come on again!!!) We (my daughter and I) say - when is it coming back on?!? Now - tomorrow is too late :)",literal
"Great....if you are brain dead Maybe 12 year olds can enjoy this show, because this is the level of complexity of the story, character development and continuity. Then again, with the level of violence and blood in this show it is not really appropriate for 12 year olds so what was the point?

The only reason I am giving this 2 starts is because the animation and the battle scenes are great. That's about it.

Pointless main hero who can defeat everyone with no sweat, for no apparent or explained reason.

Was this show supposed to be a joke or a parody of hero anime shows? If so, it seems that the joke is at the expense of the creators. Absolutely brainless, one of the dumbest (sometimes painfully so) flicks I ever watched. ""I ate too many crabs so I have become a giant crab man"". Really?!! This is beyond idiotic even as a joke.

Spoiler (though not really)

Could they make it at least a little bit hard for him at the final battle? Seriously!! Anyway....if you feel like burning some brain cells...give it a go. I literally feel dumber after watching it...",figurative
"smooth and subtle, very romantic yet brilliant satire of the liberal Judaism This is the second version of my comment.

Because only by episode 8 did I realize that it was a mixed gendre of light-hearted romantic comedy and subtle satire of the reformed Judaism. From season one I was amazed at the number of inconsistencies. It took me a while. Only when the rabbi's brother had no idea what a havdalah is, I got the message.

This is a brilliant. First, I thought how Holywood is almost never accurate about religion. With a synagogue like a Protestant church but Jewish. Yet such traditional Jewish characters and a very tight community. I thought I could picture it because I was not American. Wrong religious terms used and odd interpretations...

Anyway, the show is very enjoyable and even sweet. It's refreshing to see a positive and kind Jewish protagonist, once in a while, which so rare in the leftist modern media.

And I seem to enjoy series with Kristen Bell no matter how crazy they are.",literal
"Absolutely crazy and wildly weird A remake of a 2003 south korean film, Bugonia is another weird world of Yorgos Lanthimos with Emma Stone featuring in it.

The plot - Beekeeper Teddy (Jesse Plemons) and his autistic cousin Don (Aidan Delbis) are backwood conspiracy theorists who hatch a scheme to kidnap Michelle Fuller (Emma Stone), who is the CEO of a big biotech firm, believing that she is one of high-intelligence alien race from Andromeda controlling humans on earth.

The first half of the movie involves more conversations, which might become a little boring for many viewers. However, the next half just unravels a lot of twist with a dark tone, that give a befitting, although wildly weird, conclusion.

The director tackles a complex and layered subject that many viewers might not immediately grasp while watching the film. A dig on blind belief and misinformation is put through cleverly. The film is essentially a commentary on how easily people believe whatever theories they come across on the internet, to the point where they cling to those ideas so tightly that they can't accept the truth when it contradicts their beliefs. The climax twist cleverly drives home this message, reminding even the audience that we too can be wrong. No one is a genius, and not everything we read or see online is true.

The acting was top-notch by both alien/human Emma Stone and oddball reseracher Jesse Plumons. Stone has been on a roll with her performances lately and Bugonia continues her winning streak. The background music was sometimes too loud, but can't disagree that it was an adequate fit for the premise. The writing and dialogues were sharp and intelligent and the tonal shifts in between the scenes were just praiseworthy, sometimes being too satirical while sometimes being extremely dark and violent.

Overall, Bugonia is an engaging enough film that puts on social commentary with a unique way of storytelling, that is highly driven by surreal performances of Stone and Plumons, strong direction and camerawork, although the story could have been more tighter added with a more detailed conclusion.

My Rating : 7/10.",literal
"Determination in the face of overwhelming odds A lone prospector, Sisu, returning from the wilderness with bags full of gold encounters a detachment of Nazi soldiers who decide to take the gold for themselves. Sisu is no mere person however, but the human embodiment of mythic Finnish determination in the face of overwhelming odds. ""Koshi"" is the name that Russian soldiers gave to him, which means ""immortal."" In other words, Sisu is a one-man death squad. The Germans are told to let the man be and that they are lucky to be alive, but they laugh and ignore the warnings. What follows are battles on land, in mine fields, above the clouds, and under water, between devastating force and a sole, determined, and mysteriously powerful individual who stubbornly refuses to give up.

Indiscriminate killings and other violence dominate this irreverent, bloody, and enticing film. While I wish the dialogue and other aspects of the film were better, I loved the thrilling action and the explosive and cathartic retelling of this Finnish legend. Director Jalmari Helander of Rare Exports and Big Game fame, was present along with some of the main actors for this Toronto International Film Festival, midnight madness, and world premiere screening. After a three-hour plane delay in New York I arrived at the last minute to the packed Royal Alexandra Theatre in Toronto and the refreshing roar and hilarious jeers of the midnight madness crowd. It was so much fun.",literal
"Enough with the manicure close-ups! I like this show. Likable characters, cultural diversity, beautiful locations. All good. The lead character Morgan reminds me of Monk with his know-it-all, quirky personality. Just feel like the show is trying too hard to be quirky. Her California 'mom' wardrobe is quirky enough, but the manicure close-ups are over-kill.

I've been binge watching the show and just noticed another Monk similarities with Morgan saying 'here's what I think happened'.

LOVED seeing Daniel Sunjata again-been drooling over him since he was a lab tech on Law and Order and a sailor dancing with Carrie Bradshaw on Sex and the City.",literal
"very soapy suds with major flaws dated soap opera with every cliché in the book works best as a look at good production values of the time along with period furnishings, clothes and women's perms; but even if you can stand the plot ploys there are some colossal flaws; one, wyman is a stick, unattractive, prissy, and generally a drip; yet rock falls for her- and wants to date her in the car before she has her accident and he becomes obsessed with guilt; two, he was not responsible for wyman's husband's death; he didn't ask for a respirator, know they had only one, or that someone else might be needing it; three; he didn't cause her accident; he was trying to offer money for the hospital and befriend the cold stick when she bolted out the other door into traffic; four; she could be his mom, and he goes from glamorous girls in the bar to her, again, before he even knows who she is; five, wastrel drunk playboy rock becomes a great doctor; rock, a brain surgeon?; but there is nothing the actors can do about the story; poor agnes moorehead, a firebrand, reduced to head shots with a slight turn and wistful look- no agnes, more wistful than that; it's just dreadful, with score to match",literal
"Too Real to Bear As a woman in my mid twenties recently diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, this film was deeply uncomfortable it irritated me, pulled me in, and wouldn't let go until the end.

It captures emptiness and distorted perception with unsettling precision. I saw myself in it and that recognition brought a mix of satisfaction, fear, disgust, and acceptance.

It's a complex, haunting portrayal of despair and chaos within a wounded or unstable mind.

A brilliant work. I'll never watch it again.",literal
"Review from a Board certified Critical Care Physician An outstanding show that deserves high praise-especially for its brilliant scriptwriters and skilled medical consultants. It captures the chaotic and emotional reality of a Level 1 trauma center with impressive accuracy. The medical procedures, character arcs, and raw emotional moments feel incredibly authentic. What truly stands out is how the show portrays the intense contrast of hospital life, where joy and heartbreak often unfold side by side. It's a powerful reminder of the resilience, urgency, and humanity that define the world of emergency medicine.

A must watch!! And Dr. Robby's acting is a cherry on the top!",literal
"Disturbingly Accurate - RIP Mallory Beach Rest in Peace Mallory Beach. Taken too soon.

This show must have been produced by a South Carolinian. It is scarily accurate portraying life in Hampton County, South Carolina, and the Murdaugh family. If you live in the area you know the family and it would be hard to watch a ""hollywood"" version of a story with familiar people and places.

I am disturbed by the accuracy of the voices and looks to the real Murdaugh family. It's unbelievably close to reality. Great job to the makeup team and the actors.",literal
"This show has an identity crisis and tries too hard to be House M.D. **""Watson"" is a show that seems to have a bit of an identity crisis**. It doesn't seem to know if it wants to be a ""House"" clone, a Sherlock Holmes reimagining, or its own thing. If you are a fan of medical procedural dramas you may want to check this show out, but if you're looking for something with more of a Sherlock Holmes theme, you might want to wait and see if it finds its footing.

Watched first ep with a lot of curiosity, especially with the Sherlock Holmes connection, and while it wasn't exactly what I expected, there were some things to appreciate.

First off, if you're tuning in expecting a classic Holmesian mystery, you might be surprised. It definitely takes a turn towards a medical procedural, with more than a few echoes of ""House M. D."" - the show is trying to be ""House"" with a bit of a Sherlock Holmes theme thrown in.

The pilot episode was a bit of a mixed bag, I have to say. **Some of the dialogue felt a little clunky and unnatural, like something out of a soap opera parody**.

The acting was okay. Morris Chestnut's delivery-his voice is low, and he speaks fast, making some of his lines a little hard to understand. The cast overall had a unique set of backgrounds, which was a nice touch. The cinematography was also nicely done, which helped with the overall viewing experience.

For a show that's got Sherlock Holmes in its DNA, it felt a little bit formulaic at times, almost like it was checking boxes rather than trying to deliver something unique. One of the more interesting bits was the character of Moriarty.

**The cases themselves were engaging enough, and I thought that the medical issues were actually quite interesting.**

Show was a bit flat, and maybe didn't really pull me in initially as much as it should have. Some parts, felt dull.

The attempts at a deep, dark mythology felt a bit convoluted and didn't quite land. The show is quite heavy and brooding, which might be off-putting if you're looking for something light-hearted or fun.

It seems like they were trying to go for a dark, gritty vibe, but without the humour of ""House,"" it didn't quite resonate as it could have.

Some of the premise was promising. It's possible that as a procedural, this show might work. Or not!

"Do not watch beyond the 7. season This is one of the funniest shows ever. That is if you limit your viewing to Seasons 1 - 7. Beyond that the show has dropped dramatically in quality. It is simply not funny anymore. It is like they have pushed the ""repeat button"" and try to recycle old jokes over and over again.",literal
"Brilliant Not only did they put together a brilliant cast but the story from day 1 just makes you want to keep watching and always is a step ahead of what you think

The way through the series you slowly get each characters back story was brilliant and makes you like them even more, even the characters that don't have long parts still perform amazing

As soon as I stopped watching it I just was like when will we get another series as good as this with the story and cast being so good

This deserves every good review and I highly recommend anyone to watch it

Seeing them do another season would be brilliant.",literal
"007 shouldn't be afraid XXX suffers from the worst fate any movie can have. Mediocrity. I wish I could say it's just a big, dumb, bad action movie. But that would be unfair, cos for most of the time I was really entertained. There were some very thrilling action scenes (the avalanche was well done, just like the bridge stunt) and the plot was a 'best of' every Bond movie you've ever seen. Now it would also be unfair to call it a good movie. The acting, on all parts, is far below average. Vin Diesel doesn't seem to be able to speak one convincing line in the whole movie. Asia Argento should stick to the movies of her daddy, and the villain was a carbon copy of (again) every Bond villain you've ever seen.

I'm not sure if I like the idea of Diesel becoming the new action hero. He has some screen presence allright, but he doesn't have the 'je ne sais quoi' of Ah-nuld. Ah-nuld rules by the way (before XXX began I saw a teaser for T3, so I'm in an Ah-nuld mood, sorry bout that). Anyway, Diesel was good in Fast and Furious (a movie way better than this one)but I really don't think he's leading man material.

If you want to go to XXX, you'll probably have a fun time, but chances are you'll start to forget the movie before the end credits role. Next, please!",literal
Thorough research Looks like the producers did their research. A little exaggeration but it is subtle and the show is very enjoyable. Love seeing the new episodes and the dynamic of the three main rookies.,literal
"They made the impossible I watched the British version of The Office and became a fan - as almost everyone. So I decided to see if the American version was as good as the original. A doubt feeling emerged at the first episode, since I still was with the original - and awesome - characters in mind. They were not just funny, but peculiar, inimitable. I didn't let this impression ruin my experience, though. Gladly. The American version is obviously inspired in the British version, but they are not the same. Simple like this. The American characters are not mere counterparts of David, Tim, Gareth, Dawn... They are hole new versions of the kind of people we can easily find in any office. And equally inspired versions of these workers. Since I've lost several episodes when they aired for the first time, I'm now at the third season, and I will surely see all the episodes through the end. More than one time...",literal
"From Laughter to Letdown: Jake's Character Deserved Better The film delivers plenty of entertainment - it's lighthearted, genuinely funny, and keeps the audience engaged from start to finish. Several moments had me laughing to the point of tears. Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis once again give outstanding performances, every bit as strong as in the first installment.

However, as a long-time fan of both the film and Chad Michael Murray, I found his role here underwhelming. While the overall experience was enjoyable, I couldn't help but feel a deep sense of disappointment once the credits rolled. Jake's character feels diminished to the point of losing his original charm. In fact, his presence in the story seems almost unnecessary - his actions carry little significance, and much of the depth his character had in the previous film is erased. The decision to make him romantically interested in Tess undermines the original premise, where his affection for Anna stemmed from her personality and inner qualities. He didn't need to end up with Anna, but turning him into little more than comic relief feels like a disservice to the character.",literal
"Well Done Apple! The show captures the the complexities of such an intensely debated topic as the MeToo movement with extreme sensitivity & provide different thought provoking perspectives. I was hooked from the very first episode and the season finale blew me away. Excellent production, superb acting by main & supporting cast & a powerful script. A must watch",literal
"No closed captioning? How does this new show get away without having closed captioning. I'm old and half deaf and depend on it. And I really can't blast the volume when there were other people in the house. Maybe if and when I watch more than the first 10 minutes of it with closed captioning, I'll rate it higher than a one. Sorry.",literal
"My favorite movie that I've seen in at least a couple years Almost a perfect movie, I absolutely loved it. I knew nothing about the movie going in, and it was so much fun thinking about the moral implications of what was going on, and thinking about the choices the characters make and about how things would unfold over the course of the movie. The movie has no weak spots in my eyes, I would have changed almost nothing about the film, and I don't want to give anything away so I wont mention what I would have changed but the movie is still a wow from me and wholly earns a 10/10 score.",literal
"Incredibly ridiculous Except for some scenes, ridiculous hollywood imitations that are completely disconnected from reality, et cetera, et cetera.. This is not a comedy model, not an action model, not a war model...The Finns should also be the ones who give high marks.. A man is bleeding violently , he is covered with deep cuts everywhere, a rope is passed around his neck and he is hanged, he comes out alive hours later, the plane falls to the ground, our grandfather is alive again... The person who wrote this script has never researched how long a person who is executed survives, how long he stays under the water the longest, does he not know that the probability of surviving a crashed plane is one in a million... Again, I respect labor, I give 5 points.",literal
"Well Done! Immaculate adaptation. Looks and feels and sounds like the games, also ""behaves"" like the games too.

Obviously, as it is a TV show, TV stuff was added and mixed with it, while all without losing the games vibe, and with TV stuff being pretty good, and well made too. Almost unbelievable that we got a pretty good TV show, that stays true to, and respects the source material, while also capturing the essence of it.., must be one in a hundred, or more likely, a thousand..plus..

Very interested to see what and how it will do with the next, and if that one goes well, other upcoming seasons. Somehow it looks and feels it will be great.",literal
"No science. Paxton is a blob. From John Hughes, the director/producer/writer of 16 Candles, The Breakfast Club, Ferris Bueller's Day Off and Pretty In Pink, comes this steaming mound of elephant excrement.

Two nerds plug electric wires into a Barbie doll, hack into a Pentagon supercomputer using a Memotech MTX512 (64KB of RAM) and use this extra computing power OVER DIALUP to create a 3D digital hardlight woman who also happens to have magic powers. If they had used NASA's computer, it would be a remake of 'I Dream Of Jeannie'.

The 25 year old computer genie then gets the two 15 year old guys drunk, offers to have sex with them and then throws a party for them to get laid. Typical hijinks for an 80s teen movie, sure. But the director wanted to film his sequel, which would see the sex roles reversed. A 25 year old guy gets two 15 year old girls drunk, offers to have sex with them... yeah, I don't think that's in the same genre.

Meanwhile, the nerds are too nerdy for sex, so she throws them a party instead, where the house gets trashed, she magically conjures up other people, and they stage a home invasion in order to trick two girls to fall for them.

Bill Paxton does his best as an army gungho brother who is a typical movie bully, but his part falls flat, as does the rest of this movie.

The movie ends with a Genius Ex Machina, where the house is completely restored, there are no repercussions, and the two girls are supposedly in love now after having dumped their previous boyfriends a few hours ago.

It somehow spawned a TV series that ran for 5 years.

Demi Moore (Ghost, A Few Good Men, GI Jane) and Robin Wright (Princess Bride, Forrest Gump, House of Cards, Blade Runner 2049) auditioned for the part of Lisa The Genie.

Starring: Robert Minkoff, 71 bit parts over 17 years. Wow. (A bit part is where you have some small dialogue with a supporting or lead character). He was never a lead or support, but averaged over 4 movies a year.

Kevin Thompson, one of the dwarfs who operates the suit (when Paxton gets turned into a blob), also played the bear toy in Bladerunner, and an ewok in Star Wars (including the god-awful TV movies).

Mikul Robins, random dancer at the party, will appear in another movie with Paxton, Commando.

Wallace Langham, from nobody in this movie, to David Hodges on CSI (only took 8 years to get on the opening credits).

Chino 'Fats' Willams, drove the front loader in Terminator, now a bar patron getting drunk with some very white 15 year olds trying to talk black. Cringeworthy.

Vernon Wells, bikie in Mad Max 2, then bikie leader here. Lead antagonist in Commando (Bennett).

Robert Downey Jr, as a pretentious jerk who is only concerned with his looks and getting the girl. So, he hasn't changed much.

Ilan Mitchell-Smith, lead nerd, now a professor of medieval literature, getting a cameo on The Goldbergs (Weird Science homage episode).

Kelly LeBrock, fashion model, starred in Woman In Red, her then-husband was the producer, divorced 2 years later. Starred in Hard To Kill, her then-husband was the other co-star, Steven Seagal. Divorced six years later.

Anthony Michael Hall (The Dead Zone, Warehouse 13, The Breakfast Club, 16 Candles), one of the most annoying movie nerds, definitely the worst hairstyle (which he kept for like, a decade. Even through his 2 years where he became a unemployed drunk).",figurative
"It's over and I might kinda miss the Cody's Per usual, I was late to the party of ""Animal Kingdom"" but it didn't take me very long to binge all six seasons. When I started season four I wanted to come here to read the reviews but decided not to because I didn't want any other influence on my opinion of what was taking place with the Cody's. Now that it's over I was able to see my opinion was very similar to most. I was afraid things would start declining with each new series because that happens often. There were some things that they could have done without adding but it's not a deal breaker for me personally. Smurf's facial expression's and flaws were almost too much or weird in more ways than one but I just tried to overlook that part of it. I like a series that has character's I end up caring about or rooting for in some way or another and that happened here. The way it ended makes me think that there could be another season or even a spin off to see ""now what are you going to do"" but supposedly the 6th season was the final. I guess it's left to our imagination. If someone asked me for a good bingable scripted series recommendation I would definitely include Animal Kingdom, if they haven't already seen it because like I said, I was late starting it to begin with. It kept me entertained, intrigued and looking forward to each episode to see what was going on with all of the main character's.",literal
"Degrassi 911 The cast is capable and interesting. It seems like Sheriff Country's Edgewater is a little bigger community than Fire Country's Edgewater. If it weren't for Bode doing a cameo where he gives his cousin money to pay back their grandpa after stealing from him, you wouldn't even know it's the same TV universe. Morena Baccarin is always excellent and the production is quality. It does feel like a Degrassi mashup with a cop show, but that's not a bad thing. If you're tired of gore, classic rock hooks, floating graphics, and crime lab microscope camera angles, Sheriff Country could be for you. If you miss all that stuff, Matt Lauria also does an excellent job.",literal
"The Best Film I Have Seen This Year So Far I read the source material almost 40 years ago when I was about the same age as the characters in the story. It had a huge impact on me and I still consider it to be one of the best things Stephen King has ever written. I never thought anyone would have the guts to film this brutal, heartbreaking story and do it so well. The writing, direction, the cinematography, score and acting is all top notch and should be recognized come award season. This film is brutal, heartbreaking and ugly while also showing the power of friendship and companionship.",literal
"Why is no one talking about this show? Why doesn't anyone talk about this show? Why is all the noise always around the over-advertised, algorithm-friendly Netflix stuff, while something like All Her Fault flies completely under the radar?

From the very first episode I thought one thing: you have a missing child, a seemingly standard mystery, nothing particularly original on the surface. So for me, this kind of show lives or dies by its twists - by the whys and the hows.

And this one delivers.

It delivers brilliantly, setting a very high bar for the genre.

Let's talk about the production: it looks and feels premium. The direction is confident, the pacing tight and controlled, and the writing is far smarter than what we usually get in this type of thriller. The A-list cast is outstanding. Peña is amazing - truly amazing - and Snook gives a fantastic performance, especially in the last two episodes, where she absolutely elevates the material.

What I loved most is how the show plays with your expectations. You think you've got the answers - then you realise you don't. You think you finally understand the motive - and then a new twist lands and you find yourself going ""WTF?"" all over again. The turns are not cheap cliffhangers; they are properly earned and retroactively make earlier scenes even better.

For me, this easily tops many of the ""big"" shows of 2025 in this genre.

Be patient, don't abandon it thinking it's ""just another missing child series"". It isn't. Give it the time it needs and it will reward you with a story that genuinely blows your mind.

A definitive must-watch.",figurative
"Ambitious attempt The premise is fantastic but as I just finished episode 3, I've not yet found any of the plot lines unexpected. Rather I found the series unfolding with too many misdirections. 

I am impressed with Stana Katic and Patrick Heusinger. The supporting cast members, including Adam (Ralph Ineson), Jack and Cara Theobold.

I think however the very tight 62 day shooting schedule showed in the show's feel/appearance to its detriment.",literal
"Current season isn't as good as previous seasons I love a slow burn, I love character development, I love mysteries with clues (ex, I didn't have any issues with the pacing of season 2 of Severance), but for the love of everything good and holy season 3 of White Lotus is SO SLOW for no apparent reason. It has been such a struggle to sit through each episode. I honestly do it begrudgingly at this point because I'm hoping it gets better. Right now it's feeling like a waste of 5+ hours of my free time.

I also am having a hard time stomaching the characters this season. In previous seasons, they obviously weren't great people, but they had qualities that I could identify with or made their personalities more palatable. This season I can't stand the main characters or find a redeeming quality in them for me to sympathize with (or even cheer for their demise). I just don't care about them.

The only potential saving graces are the characters of Mook, Piper, and the one female Australian hotel aide that we saw briefly. But there isn't enough focus on any of them to detract from the awful personalities this season.

Episode 6 finally had some puzzle pieces falling in to place, but I don't think all 5 of the preceding episodes were necessary. I almost feel like they didn't have enough of a story for 8 episodes so they stretched things out to bide time until the finale. With two episodes left, not much has happened.

I wanted to love this season so much, I was so looking forward to it, but as of right now, I can't say I'm enjoying this season at all, let alone enjoying it as much as I did the previous two seasons. Hopefully the last two episodes of this season are better!

Edit after watching the finale: I can see the character development in characters like Saxon and appreciated the group of women reconciling by the end of the season. But I still stand by my feeling that there was not enough content for 8 episodes. Especially since nothing really happens until the last 30min of the finale, it felt dragged out and somehow rushed at the same time?

Because of the rush to wrap everything up in the last 30min, I felt there were many unanswered questions. It also felt strange that none of the deaths were addressed at the end, especially as they had interwoven some of the storylines.

The reveal before the deaths was, in my opinion, quite obvious and felt too on the nose.

Overall, this season did not move me in the way previous seasons had. I wanted to like it, I really did, but all I felt was relief that it was over.",literal
"Guillermo Del Toro Breathes Tragic, Terrifying Life Into Mary Shelley's Masterwork A gothic opera soaked in sadness and snow. Guillermo del Toro's Frankenstein is the adaptation of his dreams - fierce, fragile, tragic. Jacob Elordi gives the performance of his career, portraying the Creature as a being of grace and anguish. Oscar Isaac's Victor is as tortured as he is brilliant. The film is gorgeous in every way: the production design, the costuming, the blood-red skies and green shadows. Alexandre Desplat's score lingers in your bones. But what sets this apart is the soul. Few monster movies ever ask: what happens when the monster wants to die? Fewer still answer so devastatingly.",literal
"Sometimes good, sometimes crap Stana is an amazing actress. In fact, all of the actors are great. But whoever writes the script and choreographs the fight scenes needs some tutoring. Or perhaps it's the director who is to blame. But I get seriously frustrated when the common sense approach to handling a situation is completely overlooked in the interest of making something appear more dramatic. Not only is it insulting to the intelligence of the main characters, who are USUALLY very sharp, but it feels like my intelligence is being insulted as well. A good example of this is the fight scene on the train in season 3, episode 6. Rather than push the waiter (who is an enemy) from the train when he's standing in front of an open door, Emily chooses to haul him back inside the cabin and punch him. 🤷‍♀️🤦‍♀️ Soooooooo stupid. Mistakes like that cause me to periodically hate this show.",literal
"Finally, a good video game adaptation There have been several video games that get made into a film or show. Most do not translate the medias properly (looking at you Halo), but after the Last of Us set a bar the Fallout show raised it.

Video game mechanics are translated quite well, each main character is basically how you play the game-Lucy the fresh eyed newbie to the wastes, Maximus is your ""for cool stuff"" playthrough and The Ghoul is your 9th playthrough. The only complaint I can actually justify is that we had no Ron Pearlman in any capacity and the ghouls do not have their ""rotting vocal"" sound.

This show is a wonderful introduction to the Fallout lore and a wonderful adaptation of a video game.",figurative
"Sensational! I can honestly say that there has been only 2 times previous that I have been completely drawn in to a series. Breaking Bad, which did actually take an entire season for it to grab hold of me and become enthralled in it.....and the second was Succession which I was instantly hooked on after the second episode.

Mayor Of Kingstown grabbed me from the first 5 minutes and did not let go. This show pulls you in instantly. The cast is convincing. There is a lot going on, but not hard to follow. The story is not exaggerated beyond belief. You cannot help but absolutely root for Mike (Jeremy Renner) in everything he does, be it good or bad as he is always trying to do the right thing regardless of it not always being the case.

If you are thinking of watching this, have had a recommendation from a friend or family member or are a Jeremy Renner fan.... THIS IS A MUST WATCH!

"Excellent. Gets it all right. Riveting A great historical fiction of a lesser known president and era.

Matthew McFadden almost resurrects his Wambsgangs character from Succession as the humble, hopeful but slowly insane assassin.

"Nurse's view I work in healthcare and this show is an accurate depiction of what takes place in a very busy urban Emergency Department. The scenes of intubation, codes, and family grief are real and something that happens on a daily basis if not hourly. People complaining about camera angles need to realize that healthcare workers that are part of the ""action"" often feel disjointed and out of control we just have a better way of disguising it! This show shows that there are always subplots to the action that is occurring and occasionally that are bright spots! With only 2 episodes so far I say give it a chance you might learn something about healthcare. Noah Wylie is a great person to headline this show.",literal
"It should've ended when Shonda was done. I started watching this show about two years ago and thanks to Netflix I've been able to binge. I enjoyed the series a lot up until season 10. Then it started to get a little old, but still watchable up until season 14.

Now it's a total train wreck, the writing is horrible, the characters don't have the same connection as the previous ones and it's a show that focuses mainly on being politically correct and not in a good way. I watched the most recent episode and 2 main characters who were previously in the military and dealt with the horrors of war became so stressed out that their four year old boy wanted to be called a girl so they need to see a therapist to help them come to terms with it. 🤷‍♀️

I ended up giving it a 6/10 because of the first half.",figurative
"So unfamiliar now Grey's was the best show on TV. I laughed, I cried and I loved every episode. Losing Yang was hard. She was amazing. Then they made us hate Derek before they killed him off. Alex leaving was too much. I understand that Justin wanted to leave and I'm guessing that he had things going on in his personal life which made his exit so sudden. I understand that the writers did their best with what they had. I am glad he got a happy ending but Alex would never have done that to Jo. Never. Losing Alex was the last straw for me. Yes, I'm still watching but it's now just a shadow of a, show I used to love.",literal
"Refreshing This is the first time I have reviewed pretty much anything. I was searching for something new to watch and saw this show pop up in new shows. Not expecting much I decided to give it a watch. I really was not expecting to get past one episode as a lot of shows have resulted in lately. But I was so pleasantly surprised. I started watching it and actually enjoyed it. Even after enjoying the first episode or 2 I was expecting a drop off. But it only got better.

As an adult it's nice to see a new series that we can really relate to. Seems like all the shows now are geared more towards the younger audiences. And while I can see younger viewers enjoying this it's definitely heard more toward the 30s and 40s crowd. The story has been excellent. Real life problems and issues mixed in with a lot of light hearted humor. Adam and Kristen have such a great chemistry. Kristen's range really comes through and Adam just plays such a likable character that everyone would want to be friends with. Really hope we get a season 2.",literal
"I read the books and played the games...... I was terrified when news was first released about this TV show adaptation of The Witcher book series. I didn't want some random TV writers ruining a great part of my childhood (the books) while simultaneously ruining a great part of my young adulthood (the game series). I thought it would be impossible for a TV series about Geralt n' crew to be anywhere near this good. God answered my prayers people. Damn good people built and molded this series into (dare I say it) Game of Thrones S1-7 quality!!! To be completely honest episode one was an average opening. Its how the show progressed through the 7 remaining episodes that made it so spectacular. All the great parts of the first and second books are used and God did I have a mile wide grin on my face watching some of these scenes come to life. The last time I felt this good about a TV series was back in 2013 when Game of Thrones season 3 ended. Its quite the feeling. If you've read the books or played the games have no fear, the people that made this adaption keep you very comfortable while watching. I can't wait for season 2! By the way, if you don't like the fantasy genre, this is still an amazing watch in its own merit. Acting, writing, directing, cinematography, the lot of it. This show will please any viewer, guarenteed.",literal

"Inspiring to see Eisenberg pull off yet another successful film! 'NOW YOU SEE ME': Four Stars (Out of Five) 

Heist film about a team of four magicians who rob banks while performing shows and then disperse their loot to their audiences. The film reunites stars Jesse Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson (who also co-starred in the popular zombie comedy film 'ZOMBIELAND') as well as teams them with an all-star cast including Mark Ruffalo, Isla Fisher, Dave Franco, Melanie Laurent, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine. It was directed by Louis Leterrier (who also helmed such action films as 'THE INCREDIBLE HULK', the first two 'TRANSPORTER' movies and the 'CLASH OF THE TIANS' remake) and written by Ed Solomon, Boaz Yakin and Edward Ricourt. The film is a very fun, fast-paced and clever caper film that I had a blast watching (for the most part).

The film centers around four magicians: J. Daniel Atlas (Eisenberg), Merrit McKinney (Harrelson), Henley Reeves (Fisher) and Jack Wilder (Franco). As the film opens they're all called to the same location by mysterious cards left for them. The film then fast forwards to a year later when the four are working together as a team putting on an elaborate magic show where they apparently rob a guest of all his money (seemingly in a bank they transport him to at another location). An FBI agent, named Dylan Rhodes (Ruffalo), and an Interpol agent, named Alma Dray (Laurent), are then teamed together and assigned to the magician case as the illusionists get ready to pull off another big heist.

The film is packed with clever magic tricks and witty lines. It's extremely humorous at times and the elaborate schemes are very involving. It's a little far-fetched and perhaps overly complicated but it's still extremely entertaining. I was blown away by the smart script, stylized directing and exhilarating pace. It's also highlighted by a great cast. Eisenberg is one of my favorite actors and seeing the normally really insecure nerd playing a cocky and overly confident ladies' man is kind of interesting for a change. Pairing him with the always fantastic Harrelson is cool once again as well. The rest of the cast are all adequate in their parts too. The movie does get a little bogged down at times, which is a little startling due to it's normal fast pace but those scenes are few and far between. For the most part it's a very well made and entertaining film. It's inspiring to see Eisenberg pull off yet another successful film.

"Sweet 'n sour. There is a promise, I can tell you that.

As with all good series: a glimpse, trough a peephole, a flash of something beautiful, something scary, something fascinating. But maybe it's just our imagination painting monalisas, where postcard is due? You can't tell for sure, but one can always speculate.

Eddie Falco - who can forget Carm Soprano? - is in the lead, as a nurse Jackie and that is a promise of a good (if not stellar) acting. Paul Schultz (unsympathetic priest from The Sopranos) plays her lover Eddie (haha - someone got their fantasies realized? :). Dominic Fumusa (another one from Sopranos cast) plays Jackie's husband. Charismatic Haaz Sleiman (we've met him in ""The Visitor"") adds some calm to the mix as the philosophically gifted male-nurse.

In the pilot we won't see anything out this world. Love triangles, compassion and indifference of medical staff, jokes (some are actually funny!), hospital drama etc. Nothing that we could not participate in other shows, but there is this third ingredient to this sweet 'n sour dish. Something that you can't figure out from the first bite and you need take another one. Question is: will we like the aftertaste?",literal

I even like his robot companion Genos, he's also likeable too and actually kind of sweet for a tough ass looking hero himself. As well as that, he cares about Saitama and that really stands out with the show!

Once again, I was waiting for Arnold to come and bail this movie out. If Hollywood is gonna pump out movies, can I stop ruining classics? The kid in medical crisis is played out. We're done with it. We're here to get away from reality, that storyline is too close to reality.

The only reason I give this movie a four instead of a three, is due to the line, "" I'm still here...""",literal
"Effectively exposes materialism, but fails to offer a solution The film critiques Materialism, but it doesn't offer a solution

The movie is against materialism, which I agree. But the plot hasn't fully solved the problem it poses. In the end, it turns into a girl following her own whims and irrational feelings. She chooses her poor ex-boyfriend John, who is 37 without a decent job just to prove that her love is ""unconditional"", given that another good emotionally available guy is interested in her.

Love is not a business deal or a transaction. Yes.

But solving it by following your own feelings and emotions, even if they are unstable, and self-sabotaging is not a good way-out. It is simply another form of slavery.

First, you are a slave to money and superficial things. Then, you are a slave to your own whims and feelings which can be deceptive.

The message of love in this film seems to romanticize (unnecessary) suffering

It seems that in this film, unconditional love means choosing poverty, brokenness, and constant fights and stress. If you choose it, you're brave and love truly. If you choose a wealthy guy with his own traumas and insecurities, which everyone has, no matter how emotionally available he is and what stability he provides, you risk looking like a gold-digger who does not know what ""true"" love is.

This is going from one extreme to another:

We idolized wealth and power, and we realized it was not OK.

Then, we switched to idolize poverty and chaos.

But true love, in my opinion, is stable and sacrificial, not chaotic and pity-driven.

Choosing a broken partner just to prove you're not 'shallow' is a distortion of love. Sometimes, that choice stems more from a savior complex than from genuine connection.

This, by no means, suggests that poor people aren't worthy of love. Love is for all - poor or rich. But a broken person can't truly help another broken person if neither has addressed their own wounds.

What we can tell from Lucy's choice of men

Lucy's choice of partner suggests that she might have some traumas and psychological wounds which haven't healed. She seems to suffer from low self-esteem, thinking that such a guy like Harry is out of her league, and she feels ""safer"" with someone broke and broken-hearted like John.

Her decision seems to be less about freedom and more about lowered expectations for emotional safety.

It proves that past unhealed wounds often inform, even dictate, our future decisions both consciously and unconsciously.

Conclusion

To truly move beyond materialism, we need more than just emotional rebellion. We need healing, self-awareness, and wisdom.",figurative
"This is something to be ignored without remorse I was surfing trying to come across somewhat of a Succession or Industry or Severance. Well, I failed. First I thought this is related to Keith Rupert Murdoch ""factories newspapers and steamships"" so I have been expecting another Succession but I was wrong - it is another Murdoch/Murdaugh, and the show is telling about the trial of former American lawyer Alex Murdaugh for the murders of his wife. OK, fine. So be it. And then again a poor acting with at least two stars like Jason Clarke and Patricia Arquette. All right, thought to myself, let's make that do. But this mumbling and shouting is not my cup of tea. Not disappointed, just sent this show to trash. Now I think I will go to bed.",figurative

"One of the best tv shows I've ever seen. Thank god for Vince Gilligan and everyone else involved for such an amazing show!

I'm struggling to even find the correct word to be able to describe such a masterpiece.

All the emotion it evokes, the attention to detail, and amazing work from everyone who had even the slightest part in making this show so good!

I was first turned off from watching this show as I don't have high hopes of reboots and thought of it as a cash grab prequel with nothing to add.

God was I wrong and how I wish I could have seen this earlier.

I can't even explain it and others can surely put it into better words but this show is just so damn good and I love every part of it. The fact that you don't even HAVE to watch BCS before BB is a testament to how well written and thought out the show is and sometimes I wish I could have watched BCS first just to find out what that experience is like.

This really is not like any other prequel out there, this is something else! How this show doesn't have any Emmys is astounding!!",figurative

The storytelling is masterful, shifting between past and present to gradually reveal the full picture of his journey.

"A Mystery That Trusts Its Audience Wake Up Dead Man brings a fresh burst of energy into the mystery genre, blending sharp storytelling with a confident visual style that feels both modern and timeless. From the opening moments, the film establishes a tone that's playful yet purposeful, inviting the audience not just to watch, but to participate in the mystery.

The direction is stylish without being distracting-every shot feels deliberate, often hiding meaning in small details that reward careful viewers. Dialogue is one of the film's biggest strengths: witty, layered, and delivered with just the right mix of charm and tension. The cast clearly understands the rhythm of this world, and their performances strike a balance between grounded emotion and a slightly heightened, almost theatrical energy that suits the genre well.

What truly elevates the film is its confidence. It doesn't rush to impress with cheap twists; instead, it builds intrigue step by step, trusting the audience to keep up. There's a subtle escalation throughout that keeps you engaged, guessing, and occasionally second-guessing every character on screen.

A clever, confidently crafted mystery film that respects its audience and delivers tension, humor, and style in equal measure-without spoiling the pleasure of discovery.",literal

"Very disappointing I was 29 when the first Jurassic Park movie came out, and I've been a fan of the franchise ever since. I was so looking forward to another installment. I saw this one on the premiere day July 2nd with my son and some of his friends, and all but one was disappointed. The first third, perhaps even half of the movie, I found totally non-engaging, and had I not been with my son I might even have walked out, so to watch it in my home theatre setup when it later was released on disc. Especially I was not impressed by Scarlett Johansson's performance, and most of the other characters. By comparison I found Chris Pratt's and Bryce Dallas Howard's performance in the previous three movies, and off course Sam Neil, Jeff Goldblum, and Laura Dern an order of magnitude better! Actually I find any of the other six Jurassic Park movies much better! It is quite possible this installment would better please someone, who was not imprinted in their youth by the first three movies, and perhaps even did not see the three sequels. Sure I'll watch again when it released for home use, but I'm not anticipating like an eager Beaver!",literal
"What a total waste of my time A House of Dynamite tells a story of how government operates during a nuclear attack. Told from a few different perspectives, each story progresses to the same point of the President's decision to act or not at which time the story starts over with a new perspective. If you've ever seen the 2008 movie ""Vantage Point"", this film has the same concept. Spoilers ahead.

The plot itself is a great one. A story about a nuclear strike is right up my alley. However this movie fails to deliver any real conclusion. At the end POTUS is still deciding what to do and that's it! The movie ends with no resolution. We don't get to see any nuclear explosion whatsoever. And I'm just assuming the ""missile"" was nuclear. Maybe it didnt have a nuclear warhead at all. There's no way to know. Terrible way to end a film. When this movie was over I had to check and see if maybe this was the first episode in a new TV series and it's not. It would've been an awesome pilot for a mini-series if that were the case. Great story idea, poor execution. I give this movie a 5.4 so I'll round down to 5.",literal
"Good Fallout adaptation, but mediocre writing. Being a fan of the FPS games I was optimistic about the show when I read the game creator was involved. It doesn't disappoint in that regard. It captures the spirit of Fallout quite well, in every aspect. The visuals, the props, the music, the humor, and specially the violence. It really feels like you're watching cutscenes of a new Fallout game. Where it disappoints is on the actual story. The characters are interesting, but the general plot and the arc of each one are completely predictable. What kept my interest were the creative ""show, don't tell"" moments and the funny surprises that happened here and there, rather than the resolution of the plot which I could predict from a mile away. It's not great, but it's a good show and I'm looking forward to season 2.",literal

The first couple of episodes started real slow but I thought stay with it as it must get better. Well now I've seen all ten episodes I can confirm, it does not get better. The script/storyline is absolute rubbish. This is so far away from Breaking Bad which I'd rate 10/10, but this just about gets a 2/10. The story lines just don't go anywhere.....then the episode ends. I will not be watching series 2. If you left the room for ten minutes during an episode, don't rewind as you won't have missed anything, it's that bad.

"Just watch the original This show completely fails at both humour and at character, the original was beloved because it was actually funny while conveying genuine likeable characters, which was easy because they'd worked with each other before. However with this, it's just awkward, they don't seem natural in the scenes together, the jokes don't land, the characters range from boring to insulting. Avoid this show if you're a fan of the original, and generally avoid it anyway, it's simply not good in any way.",literal

Slow, disjointed, with injuries that appear and disappear from scene to scene (a broken leg). Absolutely no storyline whatsoever. The dinosaurs looked weird and seemed to have superhuman power. Don't waste your time watching this.

Another annoying aspect of the movie was the melodramatic facial expressions and zooming in on the drama. Characters were cliche and just unlikeable. I mean the only positive quality about that movie was the scenery. No 👎🏼👎🏼 thanks.",literal

""It: Welcome to Derry"" is just another casualty, I'm afraid. The characters are not likable or interesting, it's not scary, the story (if there is one) is boring. Hopefully it gets better since I'm only 4 episodes in, but I don't think so. Only King can do King.",figurative
"intense and exciting, no catharsis Absolutely no reason for this film to not end in global nuclear catastrophe.

I really liked the film until it ended so abruptly.

There is a feeling of dread from the opening titles and it sticks around the whole film, even with the somewhat disjointed structure. Some characters were introduced and then forgotten, which was disappointing. We watched 2 hours of deliberating and panic and confusion for there to be ultimately no climax, which is a real shame because I love Kathryn Bigalow's films. Even just a short little montage of nuclear silo's launching missiles, the B2 pilots dropping their payloads and the submarines firing would have been enough.

If the point of the ending was to leave us as uncertain as the characters, it should have been executed a bit more carefully - I just felt robbed.",literal
"Well researched and written behind the scenes headline type drama that's bold, brash, and provocative! ""Apple TV"" has really hit a home run with this series ""The Morning Show"" as the drama is full of life like twist and turns involving central characters as it goes behind the scenes showcasing a spotlight on both their personal and private lives.

The acting and cast chemistry is super tag team news dream duo was lead by Alex Levy( a fine turn from Jennifer Aniston) who 's super hot and looks fine and melted in front of the camera, and top anchor man Mitch Kessler(Steve Carell) who's world comes crashing down once a scandal is revealed involving him.

In a good supporting and wild card like turn enter young eager small town reporter Bradley Jackson(awesome work from Reese Witherspoon) who's a new fresh informative face who rocks the network boat even more.

One may can relate this series to present day headlines and compare it to other real life scandals also still the series is interesting, entertaining and compelling a great drama that shows the highs and lows of both private and work life as they both mix for crazy drama.

This is a weird one but a goody, written and directed by Ari Aster-Hereditary, Midsommar. It starts off in Eddington, New Mexico in 2020, just as Covid has hit and almost everyone is wearing their masks, afraid of getting the virus and dying. Joaquin is the local sheriff, who does not believe in wearing the masks. He thinks it's not necessary and keeps getting told to put one on but he resists, even when Pedro, the mayor, tells him to. Emma plays Joaquin's wife, who is traumatized by an incident that happened a few years back and Austin is a cult like figure that tries to enlist Emma into his flock. During the second half of the movie, things get darker when protesters start rioting in the streets, Joaquin runs for mayor against Pedro and one of the main four characters starts killing people. It does get pretty violent and grisly.

It's rated R for violence, grisly images, language and graphic nudity.

"Chan's Still Got It I'll be honest, I wasn't expecting much from another Jackie Chan movie with him at 71, but ""The Shadow's Edge"" genuinely surprised me. This Macau-set crime thriller brings a retired tracking expert back into the game to catch a crew of dangerous professional thieves, and it works surprisingly well.

Tony Leung Ka-Fai absolutely steals every scene as the villain; he's menacing without ever being cartoonish. While Chan is clearly showing his age, the action sequences are solid and less reliant on his typical slapstick comedy. Director Larry Yang gives the whole film a grittier tone than typical Chan flicks, which I appreciated.

The plot is pretty straightforward - cops versus clever criminals - but the execution is tight, and it's no wonder it hit No. 1 at the Chinese box office.",literal
"Better Not Fall Asleep The single most overrated show ever made. The fans are insufferable. They will persuade you to watch it until one day you decide ""why not?"". I'm here to tell you, don't bother.

This show makes paint drying seem fast by comparison. Seasons go by and to be honest, you don't even remember anything that happened because nothing really did.

The show goes far too long without a consistent plot. For half of the show we just follow Jimmy around half the time as he tries to make a living, he has no specific goals apart from being a lawyer which he has already become.

As for the other half of the show, we follow the familiar faces of Michael Ehrmantraut dealing with 'Family problems' and later Gustavo Fring who is running his drug empire. The problem is, these characters aren't even involved with Jimmy for most of the show. We learn so much about Nacho Varga and his backstory but he only has a few encounters with the main character and he barely plays a role in Jimmy's story.

The story as a whole feels disconnected. Take 'Breaking Bad' for an example, everything lead back to Walter. Nothing we saw in the show didn't somehow impact Walter and it felt more like a journey rather than a series of unconnected events. On the other hand, 'Better Caul Saul' seems constantly off topic.

In conclusion, I didn't hate the show. It can be slow at times but it truly does have some amazing episodes but the bad seems to over power the good. Wouldn't recommend.",figurative
"It Could Happen Here I had never seen so many miserable, paranoid, arrogant people in my entire life. To a one, they were just smart enough to be afraid and just dumb enough to be manipulated by those who intended to take advantage of the situation. 5 years later, Ari Aster made a movie about it.

As taut of a thriller as it is, Eddington is not a horror movie. It's a political drama that turns into a crime film halfway through. Set in May of 2020, at the height of the pandemic, we witness a town implode all thanks to a pissing match between two big fish in a very small pond. Sheriff Joe Cross (Joaquin Phoenix) is just an asthmatic cop trying to cope with his job, jurisdiction spats with the neighboring Pueblo authorities, and having to live with his conspiracy theorist mother-in-law. Mayor Ted Garcia (Pedro Pascal), is just trying to keep everyone safe during a pandemic, manage his life after his wife disappeared, and organize a deal to bring a massive data center to town that would employ thousands of residents and bring serious attention to a part of the country that's often overlooked. When Joe intervenes on behalf of an old man who is denied entry to a grocery store for not wearing a face mask, he causes a scene about it in front of the mayor. They have it out and Joe makes the worst decision of his life: He's going to run against Ted Garcia.

He recruits his two deputies as campaign staff, smothers his vehicle in campaign signage gets to work. His wife, Louise (Emma Stone) doesn't like it one bit. She's still fighting rumors that Ted got her pregnant and pressured her to get an abortion 20 years prior and knows that Joe's just using the campaign to get some sort of perceived justice. He doubles down and dives head first into the race. Only now, George Floyd is dead and the BLM protests are getting underway. Local kids are starting to protest in Eddington, he has a past littered with police violence, and his wife is now fascinated with an internet personality who spreads the Alex Jones/QAnon variety of conspiracy theories about the government being run by satanic predators. A video of him tackling a homeless man just leaked. He catches Covid.

Ted is getting major pushback on the data center over the environmental impact and the millions in tax incentives he's handing out. There are mutterings of corruption. The reignited gossip about him and Louise is turning into speculation about his wife. His son is being an unruly teenager and having a fling with an activist who used to date one of Joe's deputies.

Every new development ratchets the tension tighter and tighter, bringing a match ever closer to the powder keg that these two men placed and it explodes leaving nothing behind but ruined lives and Solidgoldmagikarp. However, as vile, self-serving, and arrogant as all of these characters are, they aren't portrayed as anything other than human beings that get caught up in the confusion and acrimony of 2020. There are no villains or heroes. There are no larger than life figures. Just two elected officials wading into territory that was better left unexplored and making everything around them worse because of it.

One thing I've always loved about Ari Aster is his ability to make even the most dour and depressing story engaging. He mixes in just enough of his trademark pitch-black humor and absurdity to keep everything from feeling like a slog. Solidgoldmagikarp, the company that wants to bulld the data center is a perfect example. It's very cleverly named after a real flaw in the way some AI language models encode language that causes them to produce gibberish and hallucinations. It's both a proud declaration that AI was not involved in Eddington's production and an apt metaphor for the way our entire news and information framework has dissolved over the last decade.

Bobby Krlic's score is good. It never reaches the heights of his work on Returnal or Beau Is Afraid, but it doesn't need to. It is punctuation in the great run-on sentence that is Eddington. It reinforces the atmosphere of a contemporary western while providing a well-balanced jolt when things heat up.

Joaquin Phoenix does it again. He has an ability to bring a reality and humanity to characters that would be insufferable in less talented hands. He expertly navigates all of Joe's facets from a brash and commanding lawman to an anxious and loving (some might even say cowed) husband to a desperate man clinging to the last shreds of his livelihood and reputation.

Much hay has been made in certain circles about how divisive Eddington is. Well, the joke's on them because that seems to be the whole point. It's 150 minutes of Aster pushing every single button he can reach. You will watch and cringe and squirm and maybe even cry, but you won't be able to look away this time. You won't have blood and gore as an excuse. You won't get lost in self-infulgent digressions. You'll see Eddington and it will gaze back into thee.",figurative
"Solid Historical Drama I have to admit going into Death by Lightning I knew very little about James Garfield and his assassination other than the basics. I just binged through all four episodes in one sitting and was blown away by how captivating it was. It's about how President James Garfield (Michael Shannon) rose from obscurity to become America's 20th President and then man who killed him, Charles Guiteau (Matthew Macfayden). If you're a fan of historical or political dramas then give this a try but make sure you give yourself enough time because once you start it you wont want to stop.",figurative
"Good series, ome issue This is an interesting series, albeit predictable. In the sense that all these series are somewhat predictable, even when unexpected twists happen. One ending is, in that regard, as predictable as its exact opposite. This is as typical as the series being 2-3 episodes too long (something this one also suffers from).

But the atmosphere and idea are excellent within the ""cult canon"", and the characters well drawn out.

In my opinion there is one main problem, and that is the acting. Notably of Mae Martin. I like Mae Martin, just not in this role. It's understandable, this is clearly her ""baby"", but she should have let some else play the character and focus on the writing.",literal
"Devastated this show is over. Was enthralled by these characters til the end. Epic show. Loved it. The characters are truly responsible for the momentum of this show, and driving it forward. The writing is constantly revolving, never stale. I usually tap out with shows after a season 2 or 3, but I kept coming back to this one because I was always happy with where things were going. Again it was never stale. Story evolved. Characters evolved. And the overall series was a nice slow burn to something very rewarding in my opinion. Sad it's over. Happy with the way it ended. And will be doing an immediate rewatch because I'm already having withdrawals.",literal
"this show is also my happy place You know that feeling when you think life is going kind of slow, it's all routine, you're doing well, but something is missing and it's something you've been looking for longer, but life isn't giving it to you yet. Well, i'm in such a phase now. I'm almost 40, experienced a lot of crazy things, ups and downs, really felt life. And now you're kind of on a low flame. Lethargy, no motivation for work, no inspiration. Every day like the other. And then all of a sudden you subscribe to apple tv, even though you haven't watched any good series for a while and have given up hope. And then all of a sudden palm royale is recommended to you. At first you have doubts, but you give the series a chance ... and now you can't get enough of it! It's brilliant, fun, i love everything with laura dern in it - enlightened, big little lies and so much more!",literal
"Better than expected. Sort of Sleepless in Chicago mixed with all the rom com tropes The title is misleading. The protagonist is doing everything she can to get a good night sleep. Anybody who has had sleep issues can totally relate. If her perfect life is so perfect why does her brain deny her well deserved rest? Bridezilla she is not but the pressure of the perfect groom coupled with a busy moment at work and the perfectly perfectionist monster-in-law turn a reasonable professional into an electric violin string. The leads are all charming, the script is predictable but sweet and funny (I particularly enjoyed the psychologist bus driver) and, amazingly enough the side characters are developed just enough not to detract from the main plot, but do come across less monodimensional than in the average romcom. Sweet, easy, not at all a waste of time. Naturally, if you are looking for tips on how to relax, get a good night sleep or know when it is appropriate to break up with your significant other, this is not the movie for you.",literal
"Good sequel! death lacking The Black Phone 2 - Review (7/10)

The Black Phone 2 is a strong sequel that keeps the dark, eerie atmosphere of the first film while exploring more about the villain and his strange powers. It feels like the story is setting up something bigger - like he's still learning what he's truly capable of. That part really worked for me.

Still, I wish there had been more death and intensity. The movie has moments of real tension, but it holds back just when it feels like it's about to go all out. I get why - it's building the villain's growth - but it would've hit harder with a few more shocking or emotional deaths.

Overall, it's a solid horror sequel with a lot of potential. If there's a third film, I hope it fully unleashes the villain's power and gives us a deeper, darker dive into his world.

Likeable characters addressing realities of sex crimes The way SVU communicates how victims of sex crimes react and deal with the psychological impact is shown effectively and empathetically. I think it is especially important to address as the public has become more aware of these crimes as part of #metoo. Some of the more recent reviews seem to ding the show as being too political in recent years - I don't see this issue as being partisan. I hope the show continues for a 21st season - the cast is excellent.,literal
"History you never learned about I didn't know about president Garfield, other than he was one of our assassinated presidents. I think this was a well told and superbly acted story of his time as president.

"Non Harmonious Just because one can doesn't mean you should. This series has a serious character likability issues. Gibbs has as another reviewer pointed out has had an amazing growth spurt!

It caters to current culture which is an anathema to a bygone era. Harmons narration is dull and confusing. The head of NCIS is played by Perkins who fits the role of a villain and suffers most from a likability standpoint!

I am just thankful the Denoseo character was not included. The plot while confusing and scattered was better than the cast. When attempting to glam onto a respected former character one must also find a cast that can fill the void. I may watch to see if these characters develop into persons I can care about. If not I'm out!",literal

"Missing more than we know It's a dark comedy satire on lousy parenting and the family members who we can't stand. It's seriously predictable yet funny. A lousy horror movie and a misrepresentation if you stack this against the in-depth history of true horror films. To think this director is grabbing a 20 mill paycheck on another remake or a remake for Evil Dead part 15? And you, the audience, all made that happen. Is everyone nuts? The film maker bar is so low today you could trip over it. Please tell us - who the hell is green lighting these smash and grab hyped up fodder flicks? It's beyond comprehension the lack of talent in Hollywood today. A perfect example why children should not be executive producers or studio decision makers. But sadly, Hollywood will never see the lack of creativity. The small minded have won. Deal with it. They can only see the bottom line. Dollars overrule everything. The saddest past of all this wasted time on screen - This film was no better than Children of the Corn and that sucked.",literal

There are monsters of course but they are persona with emotional, they have no salvation but is interesting to know about these corrupted souls

These are incredible episodes of television especially season 2 episode 5 and season 1 episode 8

Great actors and great acting, however annoying some plotlines and characters are. Hate derek shepherd tho. Awful man. Meredith u are the sun (also cristina). I love you my twisted sisters. Lexie grey and mark sloan live forever in my mind.

"Masterpiece Brienne is one of the few characters in Game of Thrones who has always been truly honourable and since her introduction I've grown to love her and root for her to show the world how incredible a woman she is. Therefore, one of the highlights of this finale for me was seeing Brienne taking her place first as one of those representatives tasked with choosing the next ruler, and then on the Small Council, where she can help build a better future for the citizens of The Six Kingdoms (that still sounds odd to me). Who better to be Commander of Bran's Kingsguard?

Having been knighted in 8.02 (one of the best scenes in the series for me) as a knight of the realm, once Sansa split the north away from the other kingdoms, it made sense to me that Brienne would step up in this way. Sansa has the support of the entire North again. She's home and safe, so Brienne can move on to serve and protect another of Catelyn's children. She wanted to be a knight, she wanted to serve the realm and she's always wanted to do good. If any character deserved to see their dreams come true in a world were we are used to that rarely happening, it was Brienne. The fact it is Brienne, who gets to take over from Jaime Lannister in her new role, is the final piece of the puzzle (I don't count The Mountain).

Speaking of Jaime, the scene I'd said for years that I wanted to see if he really had to die, was Brienne filling his pages in the Kingsguard book with his good deeds. Ever since vile Joffrey mocked him for his empty pages and Brienne read the words, I've wondered if this would be part of the ending. Personally, I loved it and it was the scene that made me the most emotional this week. I know many have grumbled about Brienne doing this after Jaime left her in 8.04, seeing it as a woman serving the story of a man, but that's not how I see this plot line at all. Yes, it completed Jaime's story and yes, she perhaps described the events in the most favourable way, but bear in mind for his entire adult life, he was viewed in a negative light for an action which, like Jon's, was for the greater good. Seeing the devastation Dany caused only reinforced just how significant his choice was when he killed the Mad King. Yes, he broke Brienne's heart and I hated it (putting them together in 8.04 both gave me what I wanted, while also giving me what I didn't - thanks again to the rushing), but I also loved that be giving us this scene, they also brought to the forefront again, how special Brienne is.

She has always done what was just and honourable and has always believed in the good in people and it was because of her that many of the deeds she added to the book even happened! Jaime may have hurt her, but we saw she wasn't bitter and wanted the good he did to be recorded. She didn't let his last action cancel out all the others. I also loved that it was clear in that scene that she still cared deeply for him and had forgiven him for being unable to leave his past behind. Why do I say that? She still carried Oathkeeper; in such a sparse room there was a lion statue prominent on the table behind her; and the music playing over the scene was (I think) a blend of ""A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms"" (played when she was knighted) and ""I Am Hers, She Is Mine"" (which has accompanied scenes with both Robb/Tulisa and Tyrion/Shae), reinforcing the special connection they shared. Add to that, the beautiful performance by Gwendoline Christie (she better be nominated for awards); you see the emotion Brienne is holding back in her eyes as she writes, as she takes her time to complete her task, all before she runs her hand over the page gently before closing it. Yes, it gives Jaime closure and honour again, but it also is a testament to who she is as a person. If we were all a little more like Brienne, we'd all be better for it.

Few characters so richly deserved to end their story with all the respect and status they'd always dreamed of. I'm only sad we won't get to see all the good deeds that she will do, that will fill her own pages.

A final musical chapter for television's most ambitious soundtrack

I'm a big fan of film and television scores and few are ever as impressive as this one and a consistent comment about season eight from me and many others, has been just how incredible Ramin Djawadi's score has been. Over the years, he has created beautiful themes for characters, Houses, while setting the mood for every political manoeuvre and shredding our nerves while watching every battle.

Season eight has seen him play with themes to great emotional effect and The Iron Throne was no different. His slower rendition of The Rains of Castamere, associated so heavily with the violence of The Red Wedding, heightened Tyrion's grief and I've already spoken above about his delicate way of bringing the history of Jaime and Brienne's relationship in to the story's end. Dany's tragic end contained callbacks to her and Jon's theme and we also had the rousing farewell to the Starks, blending the theme most associated with their House, with the series's theme, while also throwing in echoes of their past (Arya sailed away to echoes of the same theme she had at the end of season 4 for example). Few shows have scores that are so ingrained in the emotions of the scenes, that you can see them as you listen to the music on its own, but season 8's music in particular certainly achieves this. Ramin, please hurry up and announce international dates for the next Game of Thrones music tour! Until then, I'll have the albums on my constant playlist!

A visual masterpiece, setting a new bar for television & film!

Even those less happy with this season have agreed that visually, nothing compares to Game of Thrones, in terms of the quality of the cinematography, visual effects and overall production values. In a way, I think we've become complacent about how each episode has a visual quality that surpasses not just other television shows, but most films too and the finale certainly didn't drop the ball in this area.

We had the terrifying images of Dany addressing her armies, the breathtaking image of her literally being a dragon, as Drogon's wings unfolded behind her, the haunting echoes of her vision of coming face to face with the throne and the incredible framing of her death in Jon's arms. Drogon has now become so realistic, that you simply accept that there's a huge dragon on screen, screaming at the loss of its mother, nudging her lifeless body and then unleashing fire, finally removing the damn throne from the world! Plus, that Stark montage? Gorgeous. I only hope this series has set the bar for other shows to try and surpass in the future.

Then there were all the little nods / call backs to the last eight years.....

Okay, I admit, I didn't pick up on all of these on the first viewing and I assume I've not even noticed them all yet, but the series finale was full of nods to the show's past, some obvious and some wonderfully subtle. There were the breathtaking costume choices (look at Sansa's coronation dress - weirwood leaves, dire wolves and fish scales, to represent every aspect of her heritage), the old jokes (Tyrion is clearly never meant to finish that brothel joke, while Stannis' influence on Davos' grammar remains strong). Lord Varys was also annoyingly correct that the history books won't mention Tyrion (boo!), although giving the book the obvious title was a bit cheesy, while Tyrion has gone from the rebel in the Small Council dragging the chairs around, to the man leading a group of his own choosing.

We had Greyworm keeping his promise to Missandei and heading to the beaches of Naath, while Arya, the girl who was once no one, sailed away proudly declaring she was a Stark. We also saw a nod to how The Iron Throne is described in George R.R. Martin's books when Dany recalls what she'd heard about it, a possible appearance by Hoyland Reed at the Dragonpit gathering, as well as a nod to Martin's as-yet unwritten seventh book, A Dream of Spring, with the green shoot visible through the snow, as Jon leaves The Wall, as well as a mirror of how episode one began, as the gates of Castle Black rose to let him pass through. Each one of these made the conclusion to the series more satisfying for me. Feel free to point out all the ones I've missed!

Looking forward, by looking backwards

It's sad to end this post without being able to speculate on what will happen in the next episode. Instead, we have a number of prequels in various stages of development to look forward to. They are all being made with HBO, so the production quality should remain and George R.R Martin is involved too, in some more than others. We don't know much yet, other than the rumours that the first of these prequels to go in to production is going to look at the first Long Night. The casting for this series also has me hopeful, as it contains some of my favourite stage actors (especially Denise Gough, John Heffernan). Nothing can replace Game of Thrones for me in this world; the characters are just too special, but I'll certainly be tuning in.

I might write a few posts reflecting on various aspects of the series, now that the story and the characters' journeys can be viewed as a whole, but for now, I'll end by saying, that despite my sadness that season eight was so short, when there was enough rich material to give us so much more, I'm satisfied with how the story ended. Overall, it made sense to me, even the elements that I'd loved to have turned out differently (I'm looking at you Jaime and Dany). Few shows grab my attention the way this one has (it was after season two that I read the books) and few stories have offered me so many incredibly complex and compelling characters to invest in emotionally. It'll be a series I return to many times in the future and it will undoubtably remain one of my favourites and for that I'm grateful to everyone who has had a hand in its creation.",figurative
"Binge Worthy! Finally got around to watching the first two seasons and I'm kicking myself for waiting so long. This was good. Really good. It takes place near as can tell in 1974 on a Navajo reservation. The main characters are Joe, a police lieutenant at the reservation police department and his wife, a nurse at the health clinic on the reservation. So the story is told from the point of view of white man's justice versus Indian justice and also white man's passing bills that effects Indian women's health. Both season's deal with a big murder case and with the passing of a bill giving doctors the right to sterilize woman after they give birth. Throughout the two seasons, Joe is trying to find out the truth behind the murder of six Indian men in an explosion. One of the men was his son and since it happens the first five minutes in, I don't think that's a spoiler. There were other key characters and all were important to the story, most notably his female Sargent and his new deputy. I thought the acting was incredible and the plot was well written and executed. I'm just sorry that the next two season's are only on AMC which I won't be adding for only one series. Highly recommended!****** Edited to add that season 3 is now available on Netflix. It was good, but the first two seasons were the best. Now hopefully season 4 will air on Netflix in the next year.",literal
"I really wanted to like it but the lead actor is terribly miscast I didn't know there was another Sutherland and now I know why....! I started watching it because I really like Kristin Kreuk and I know she has great chemistry with her co stars . Ok I didn't expect to find ever again the extraordinary chemistry she had with Jay Ryan on CW's Beauty and the Beast or even the really good one she had with Tom Welling in Smallvile, but with this Sutherland...ZERO chemistry. The whole TV series is like a hallmark crime mystery with a romantic subplot with zero chemistry. And I know it's not Kristin's fault. The lead (Karl) is not convicing at all. The actor mumbles and hunches all the time and looks like he has no confidence at all but you want me to believe that he is the Chief of police? Hilarious. I believe that if they had paired Kristin with another actor who would play this character more convincigly, it would be so watchable only for the romantic subplot....but this Beta male chief of police?? It's a no for me! 6 is only for the scenery and the adorable Kristin.",literal
"The essence of modern prefabricated, formulaic cinema If you have half a brain (or better no brain at all), have been bread on video games, TV commercials and blockbusters,  and you're under 18, this movie is definitely for you. You'll find everything you need: stereotyped and wooden acting; sophomoric direction; tasteless and ignorant action scenes filmed with this oh-so-cool ""time stretching"" effects; tasteless and ignorant blend of genres, entirely formulaic (horror, martial arts, costumes); digitally over-enhanced cinematography; and above all, glorification of the ""state-of-the-art"" technology of modern filmmaking, absorbing all of the filmmakers energy, with nothing left for the important things: scenography, acting, storytelling, awareness of the camera, subtext. A computer could have written and directed this movie. You wouldn't have noticed the difference.

This movie looks, sounds and feel exactly like an over-long TV commercial. All of the actors are treated like props, even more than in Lucas's last films. ""Matrix"", ""X-men"" and ""Blade"" look like intellectual masterpieces in comparison.

Everything is said, about the filmmakers intentions and abilities, in the first killing: you have this stupid magnifying of every single sound details (climbing the rocks, steps, panting etc..), showing a mind who thinks only in terms of technical matters and envelope, and has no clue about what's a character and what's storytelling. Instead of focusing on the woman's struggle and fear, they focuse on the ""cool"" visuals and sounds. Just like in a video game. All humanity is lost. Frightening.

I'm not quite surprised that this quintessence of mindless exercise in MTV-clips-like formulaic filmmaking for the modern masses comes from my own birth country, France, as it has a long story of desperately trying to compete with american technical skills, which sadly often ends in products even more senseless, trendy and utterly empty than many american blockbusters. First ""Vidocq"", now ""Le Pacte des loups"". Vive la France! Hasn't Jeunet, with ""Amélie"", shown that there IS another way for french filmmakers than being shallow, trendy and fomulaic, to achieve commercial success?

There ARE some good french actors involved. I'm really wondering how they reacted when seeing the petty results of their efforts.",figurative
"Oz is basically an inversion of what the 1939 movie depicted Full disclosure: I haven't read the book ""Wicked"" or seen the stage musical, so I can't compare the movie to them. What I can say is that the movie basically depicts Oz as 1930s Germany with magic. Indeed, the Wizard notes that nothing unites people like giving them someone to hate. The suppression of animals reflects the suppression of indigenous cultures by colonizers. When the goat professor gets taken away, Elphaba's response calls to mind Martin Niemöller's ""First they came..."" (acknowledging that he didn't speak out for persecuted groups because he wasn't a member), although it's the opposite: Elphaba speaks out even though she's not a member of the persecuted group.

Aside from all that, it's an impressive movie, with great performances from Ariana Grande, Cynthia Erivo, Michelle Yeoh, Jeff Goldblum, Bowen Yang and Marissa Bode. The main thing to take away from it is that Elphaba got dealt a bad hand at every step, while Galinda is a vain if kind-hearted priss, along with the warnings about fascism, bigotry and gaslighting. I recommend it.",literal

Master director Yorgias Nominationous just piles on the charisma by giving Stone a ""Mommy Dearest meets Yul Brenner in a way-off Broadway Czech experimental theater production"" look that will send you to the refreshment stand to see if the Avatar commemorative bin is already available well before the half-way point of the film.

"Steven Spielberg meets Stephen King Stranger Things is the newest foray into Netflix's original programming, of which brings us their most impressive- and strange- production to date. When a young boy named Will Byers goes missing, his friends, mother and the town are thrust into a conspiracy involving a mysterious girl named Eleven and something even more sinister hiding in the woods of Hawkins, Indiana.

From the get-go, you can tell this is an homage to classic '80s Spielberg, drawing on E.T. and Close Encounters, as well as JJ Abrams' Super 8. But, as the show progresses, it becomes more and more like a twisted Stephen King story set in a Spielberg movie. It becomes a dark and twisted ride into an even darker and more disturbing world where the stakes feel higher than anything before it.

I can't go into great detail because spoiling even just a bit of the story takes away from the greater mystery, but I can say, it's one of the most thrilling and intense series to be on TV, without being on TV. If it were to continue, they have to pull the same punches they did with the first season, because they took a great many clichés, and somehow made them fresh and surprising, save for just a couple that they purposefully left cliché.",literal
"Not great but not bad either I started watching this after it first aired and have now caught up (episode 7) and will certainly watch it through to the end. The basic plot of airplane full of convicts crash lands in Alaska and doughty Marshal (Jason Clarke) starts a multi agency manhunt aided/hindered by CIA operative (Haley Bennett) who is after one specific convict presents like Con Air meets The Agency but it quickly becomes something else. Written and produced by Jon Bokenkamp of The Blacklist fame this shares a lot of the same traits, nothing is as it seems, everybody has secrets and an agenda, alliances change, friendships are broken and generally this is perfectly acceptable but, just as in The Blacklist, the long arm of coincidence is stretched mighty thin. On the plus side the two main plot strands, capture the convicts and hunt down the 'special' convict (Dominic Cooper) keep each episode powering along nicely and if that were all that was going on my rating would be higher. Clarke and Cooper give solid performances and in supporting roles Alfre Woodard and Dallas Goldtooth do their best with underwritten roles. On the minus side are the way too numerous sub plots that clutter each episode and in a couple of cases derail the episode, again a weakness of The Blacklist. Particularly weak is the family drama surrounding the Marshall, not a shred of it is credible and the poor acting of Simone Kessell doesn't help raise the dramatic tension. Overall this is a perfectly good watch and if you can shut out the plot inconsistencies it will see you through some early winter nights, remember, it's TV drama, not Shakespeare.",figurative
"So far so good... I can't know how to hear any more about tables, which is why I am more to happy to talking about chairs. Tim Robinson is simply too good in this thrilling and unraveling mystery about a company that is both everywhere and nowhere at the same time. This version of Tim Robinson's character is a bit different than the one he played in Friendship. This man has a lot to lose. He has respect from his coworkers, a family that loves him, a car that he doesn't have to share for his wife's flower business. He has it all. I fully expect this series to push the boundaries when it comes to shows about office furniture, but for now we're on chairs...and this show delivers the chairs. Unlike his recent feature film ""Friendship"" (which has absolutely no friendship in it), this show delivers the goods immediately, and I for one expect it to continue doing so until the very end.

"Gradually Disappointing. The first episode I saw of this series was really quite original. We were presented with a disparate team of 'experts', each with their own particular brand of inadequacy or character, led by an able, middle-aged gent.

To me, at least, the idea was good for about half a dozen episodes. After that, the whole format became repetitive beyond belief. There's so much CSI on telly at the moment - especially on Channel 5 - that the program makers obviously needed to do something different. Their tack was to emphasise the character traits of the players.

From here, I thought it went down hill. The format became an exercise in self-parody. Abby became more goth; Tony became more macho, Ducky became more abstruse, and so on. The actual crimes and investigations became secondary to the tiresome sparring, and excessively juvenile personal politics.

I used to make a particular point of watching this series and would have awarded it 8 stars. Now I can't be arsed, and begrudge the 6 I've posted.

Incidentally, does anybody know how Jethro is going to get that boat out of his cellar, presupposing he ever finishes it? The place seems only accessible down a narrow flight of stairs.

Oh, and one other thing. When I worked in laboratories in both pathology and the petrochemical industry; eating and drinking at the work-place was a summary-dismissible offence on account of the risks of poisoning, infection or contamination. In one department, even ball-pens and all cosmetics were banned. Seems that the US navy run a slacker ship than the rest of the world.",literal
"Truly gripping and well done, but... Claire Daines did a fabulous job as the fragile and scattered protagonist. Matthew Rhys was perfectly creepy, and Brittany Snow was the perfect element of decency. This was a beautifully crafted and well-acted series. Of course, there are some holes in the story, with the largest being the lack of minimal security cameras in many of the characters' homes. I recognize that in order to keep the tension, it was requisite that video of certain crimes and comings and goings could not be readily available, but to be believable, the Ring camera, Wyze cam, and Blink camera footage has to be included. Other than that, it's definitely at the top of the streaming offerings in 2025.",literal
"Central Intelligence 2.0 If you've seen 'Central Intelligence', that buddy film starring The Rock, and Kevin Hart, then you're half way to having seen this film already.

Yes, it's fun. Yes there are literally one or two moments where you might crack a smile, but this is so derivative of 'C. I', it's practically a sequel.

This is no better than a 4.

Ritchman does his best Dwayne Johnston acting as a meek, and mild, and somewhat excitable nerd type who's not to be messed with. While James plays the role we've seen him play in almost every film he's ever been in.

The supporting roles, are barely there. If they were support joists for a roof, you'd be clearing up a mess, and building a new roof.",literal
"Should be a 2 hour film not a 10 hour show Sadly I wanted to really enjoy this. I love the staging, cinematography, music the styling I loved all of that but unfortunately it fell flat with the storyline. 100% a style over substance project. Great casting, brilliant actors in the show but unfortunately let down by poor scripting and a storyline dragged out full of potholes. Norma being compass mentis throughout the whole story but can't speak yet no one offers a piece of paper and a pencil to write down what she's thinking was absurd from the word go. I wish they could've just ended it at the end of season and not dragged it out as I won't be watching anymore. A 3 out of 10 was very generous.",literal
"Is it Just Me or.... I loved this series.

But, it started a nosedive crash into boredom and sloppiness with the introduction of new actors in place of Thomas Gibson and Matthew Gray Gubler.

The new characters are dull, drab, hamming their roles and do not fit with the group nicely.

The run-time of the episodes also dropped and they wander off into the personal lives of the characters.

Is it just me who feeling the show is going downhill or other fans too?

I hope they will come back to bring the show to its former status.",literal
"Meh... I want to start by saying I am a HUGE Superman fan. From the comics, animations, television shows and movies, I have seen them all more than I care to admit beyond this post. I have been patiently waiting for this movie ever since it was announced as getting a reboot (even though I thought Henry Cavill did a fantastic job and deserved one more movie). James Gunn proved himself with the success of the MCU movies he was involved in but the DCU is not the same.

Now for the movie itself. There were some great moments and some terrible moments. I went in with an open mind but found myself eye-rolling and sighing throughout majority of the film. There some truly inane moments and jokes that were already seen in the trailers so they lost their ""punch"". I will not give away any spoilers because I do not like when others spoil it for me but I will say without a doubt that Krypto was the best part of the film. Give it a shot or not, you might feel differently.

P. S. Don't forget to stay for the end credits 😉",figurative
It was good It was a well produced and filmed horror film compared to the rest of the genre. The story itself is too chaotic and random for me at times but at its core it's really enjoyable.,literal
"Did everyone forget how to act? I waited so long for this next one to come out and I was highly disappointed with this one. New cast was just plain and didn't fit to be in ""horsemen"" squad. Also what was with the acting with everyone? It was so bad performances that everything felt like I was watching middle school play. Plot and dialogues were kind of boring and I was expecting to see more magic tricks and then the movie ends.",literal
Don't waste your time I only went to see this movie because of the 7.3 rating. I passed up seeing a couple of other movies to see this one. I was very disappointed from the get go. I didn't like a single character. I thought older Fantastic Four movies were better. The Silver Surfer story line was already done. This movie offered nothing. Nothing. It was like watching a 1960's era Sci Fy movie that had two stars on TCM. Save your money. See something else.,literal
"Careful: It's Addicting I saw a TikTok about this show a few months ago and I'm a huge Scott Speedman fan, so I thought I'd check it out. Well, I kind of didn't stop watching. I couldn't stop! The storylines are written so well, every single actor is incredible and it has a really good ending. Everyone I know are watching other shows and I've been telling everybody to watch THIS show b/c it will not disappoint. I'll probably re-watch the whole thing again because otherwise I can't get my Cody family shenanigans fix. Ha! J ended up being my favorite though. I loved the changes through everyone's characters though, too.",literal
"I miss it! I've loved Shameless ever since the beginning of Season 1 and now that it's over I really miss even though it was probably time for it to end! While it was still worth watching, it just wasn't the same once Emmy Rossum left. Shameless was such a great show for such a long time that it was hard to say goodbye...I miss it!",literal
Really liked Season 1 and Season 2 is even better Season 1 had great plots with high quality acting. Season 2 is now starting to include some personal background to the characters so that you can identify with them more closely.,literal
"Silly and campy  late night faire -- that I rather enjoyed! The powers-that-be in Victorian London note the rise of street prostitution in their capital city and come up with the ""French System."" A kind of upmarket government-sanctioned brothel. However the public (and the police) aren't let on about their little secret.

This is the 1960's and the wild, the wacky, and the wacky-baccy has started to get to people's heads. This is one of those films that you feel is going to end up with a speed-ed up chase scene with all that you have learnt so far carefully junked -- but it doesn't quite get there. Close -- but not quite.

However it is also a classic case of setting up a plot and not bothering with it after a certain point in time. Maybe it didn't fit in with the bare breast quota laid down by the producers or maybe they spent too much time try to work out how to best film down a woman's cleavage?

The casting of the (now late) David Hemmings in a double role (bad/good) is a fatal mistake because both characters act pretty much the same and we only have hair colour to tell one from the other. After Blow Up he was seen as hot property although he is a cold fish who can't act a jot! 

If you don't come from England and don't know Victorian literature then a lot is going to fly over your head. Given that the jokes are rare enough already the film can't afford their loss -- especially to a world audience. Indeed some of the jokes are in very bad taste: A little girl singing about her ""little pussy"" while we focus on George Sanders doing double-takes wouldn't be allowed today.

The Best House in London doesn't really have a plot more a laundry list of things that they want to get in. A mad Italian with an airship, the temperance movement, the Suffragettes, the upper/lower classes, people that are pro/anti the whore trade and women that don't want to be saved from a life of vice. Big money has been spent on the sets (complete with half dressed girls) and the left over change has gone on the script.

This is the kind of stuff I like watching late at night when I can't sleep (TCM puts it on that this time) when on-screen energy means more than common-sense. I am giving it a seven because I was entertained, but maybe that seven says just as much about me, where I come from and what I like than it does about the film. I can forgive campy nonsense -- can you?",literal
"My suspension of disbelief was in critical condition. I get how TV works. You need drama, and you therefore need dramatic scenarios. Still, to me, there's a point where it starts to become absurd.

From the characters and personnel of the hospital, to the patients, to the injuries and diagnoses: they're all over the top, to the point where it became unbelievable.

Also, lots of virtue signaling. The assembly line of patients becomes a conveyor belt of tropes and social commentary. Lots of evil white men and spunky women to put them in their place.

I suppose, to some, this could be the appeal of the show: these multiple layers intertwined make for some really potent storylines.

1) The medical side: exotic ailments, medical danger, and suspense along with visceral gore, and humanity.

2) The characters and relationships of the staff.

3) Social commentary related to the procession of patients.

It's a potent cocktail of dramatic themes and events, and I guess I understand why the show is so popular, but to me, it put my suspension of disbelief into a coma.

What follows is not a spoiler, but an example:

A girl comes in, unresponsive, high levels of blood alcohol. Ignorant male doctor starts treating her for the alcohol. Spunky female med student infers that this girl must've been roofied! Needs a drug test and a rape kit! Intuition is always correct in this show, so of course, she was roofied and raped, they arrest the guy who brought her in.

And it's just stuff like that over and over again: exotic ailment + staff drama + social commentary, over and over and over again.

But, to me, the procession of these sorts of ""convenient"" medical problems that are constantly this trifecta of medically interesting, an opportunity for character investigation, and a vehicle for social commentary were too stilted to be believable.

And that's doom for the enjoyment of a show. As soon as the 4th wall is broken, and you're starting to notice tropes and patterns about the production of the show itself, you're not actually engaged in the story anymore, and it becomes tedious.

I think I made it 6 or 7 episodes.",literal
"Solid acting, fun, and fast-paced...great job! Eisenberg, as I'm sure many will notice, is beginning to develop his own typical character: the quick-witted, arrogant-yet-jittery, young smart guy. But instead of running facebook, this time he's one of the top magicians in the world. And he's perfectly cast for it.

The movie follows 4 magicians or illusionists in various stages of their careers, as they all receive mysterious invites to join up. After meeting, the ""Four Horsemen"" go all Robin Hood, robbing banks and stealing from CEOs as part of their shows, and giving the money away to the audience. The Incredible HulkI mean, Mark Ruffalo, plays the FBI agent trying to lock them all up, while Morgan Freeman plays the narrator explaining everything to youI mean, the ex-magician trying to debunk the magicreally, that's just a clever way to get Freeman to narrate stuff

Pros: - Everyone puts on a solid performance. No weak points acting-wise, great job on casting. - It's fast-paced, the action never hits any dull parts. And even the small romance scenes don't drag on long enough to take away from anything. You're pretty locked-in from start to finish. - Particularly great scenes between Eisenberg, Ruffalo, and Harrelson in the first half of the movie. - Great ending, if you've been paying attention. 

Cons: - You wish there was more dialog between Eisenberg and Harrelson. - The 2nd half of the movie might move a bit too fastagain, pay attention. - Somebody thought this was a Marvel movie for like 5 seconds, and had The Hulk fighting Gambitwaitis that a bad thing?...

Overall, this movie is a solid flick with some great actors that you shouldn't sleep on. It clocks in at just under 2 hours, but it won't feel that long at all.",literal
"Helped elevate pop culture The earlier seasons from 1-5 are pretty brilliant (6-12 are good, but not quite as good), the characters are perfectly developed, they're all likable, the comedy is understandable and it doesn't feel like you're being made fun of intellectually. Sheldon, Howard and Penny are three of my favorite sitcom characters of all time, they are the three consistently lovable, emotionally resonant and hilarious characters. Raj, Leonard, Bernadette and Amy are alright, but don't have as interesting plot lines as the other three. The show gets a lot of pop culture references and facts wrong, it seems to make fun of nerds/geeks at times and the storylines seem to de-escalate during the next 7 seasons, the show isn't bad like certain people make it out to be, the comedy is great, the performances are great and it's a fun show to watch casually.

Now, granted it's not a Seinfeld level sitcom, it can be intellectually challenging at times, certain friendships scenes are difficult to watch like Sheldon constantly making fun of Howard, Sheldon being a cold, selfish, sour emotionless robot, I believe his mother should've had him tested at a better place (no offence), despite all that he is still a lovable character, the show is basically building up a ""Sheldon redemption arc"" kind of thing. He starts off like a machine, gradually starts to turn human when he meets Penny and reaches close to full humanity when he starts a relationship with Amy. This has probably been said enough, but Jim Parsons' portrayal of Sheldon is perfect, literally nobody else could've taken the role, he EMBODIES Sheldon and that's what makes this show so addictive, Sheldon, you never know what's going to happen with him next episode but you know that you will love it.

The finale in this show is heart-warming and I balled my eyes out both times I have watched this show during the final episode. Sheldon and Amy are nominated for a Nobel Prize and win, Amy finally tells Sheldon what the audience has wanted to tell him all this time, after this intensely emotional scene, Sheldon and Amy walk on stage and as he looks out into the audience he sees Howard, Leonard, Penny, Raj and Bernadette sitting and cheering him on even after what he said to them in this episode, as he sees them he realizes that he has been taking them for granted and during his extraordinarily emotional speech, he expresses his true feelings for his friends and it is easily one of the most emotional and best finales in sitcom history! Sheldon finally deems Howard as an astronaut - this is where I started crying - this scene really shows us that Amy made Sheldon more humane and realize how much he was taking all of his friends for granted.

This show starts with a big bang and ends in one, all characters have growth and development, especially Howard, creep turned into an acclaimed astronaut who has a great wife, two kids and a nice personality, Raj has selective mutism (cannot talk around women) and later he is able to talk to Penny without alcohol and this is a big character growth moment. Penny becomes way less self-involved, more intelligent, accepting of the group, isn't afraid of commitment and gets pregnant, once hated the idea of having babies. Amy learns to be less of a pushover and changes from fully functioning cyborg into caring and loving human being. Leonard learns to express himself and his opinion to Sheldon. This show made nerds happier to express themselves and elevated pop culture, even gained pop culture status. It is not deserving of all the 1-4 star ratings, it should get at least 6 for the performances and overall comfortable feeling to show overall.

Character ranking (just a random thing I decided to do): 6. Bernadette 5. Amy 4. Leonard & Raj (tie) 3. Penny 2. Howard 1. Sheldon.",literal

I didn't think it was going to be this good, I'm up to episode 8 and I'm itching to see the next episodes already. If you love your gangster movies or just love movies with a great storyline get this watched. Manfredi done 25 years in the slammer for things he done with his role in the New York Mafia. He then gets out and sees the family (mafia) things have changed and he must go elsewhere to create his own mafia. It's truly a great watch.

"""I live for this"" Let me begin by saying the only thing 'tripple' about the film is it's suck-factor. Other than dealing out a healthy slice of Vin Diesel justice the film offers little more. The direction is to say the least excrement; a soundtrack that would get even Stephen Hawking running in terror; acting as usual for Vin is top notch, raising the bar for the likes of Kevin Spacey and Anthony Hopkins. If you didn't enter with epilepsy you're sure as hell going to leave with it; as the senses are raped by explosion after mind-numbing explosion. It's true what they say; sawing your own leg off with a stone is both less painful and more entertaining. The plot is overly simple to the extent of it being a personal affront to the audience; how many times have we been subjected to the same 'working for the government - saving the world' combo? Too many is the answer, too many Vin, don't let it happen again.",literal
"Horrifyingly beautiful WoW I literally don't even know what to say about this film , genuinely one you watch and think about forever.

Round of applause for the amazing actors.

The character development was truly crazy How can you go from strongly disliking someone to still mourning their death ? I don't know but they did it.",literal

"Wasted my time At first it didn't seem like a bad movie to me, in fact I enjoyed like the first 20-30 minutes. Then that story becomes everything that the entire premise is not supposed to be, it's actually a devaluation of the human being, it's like implying that older people lose value and I don't know how at the end of the story when there was never anything to do with a solid relationship with the second protagonist, they suddenly pull out of the sleeve that she is so in love that she can't live without him and it is and is something that you can't believe, because in reality they never put it as a premise nor did it make you click or think that they were a couple, or that they could be a couple, it's super Okay the movie is rushed. In the end it has no sense or cohesion.",literal
"First Three Episodes Honestly I think I'm being generous giving this a 5.0. But that is mainly because of Patricia Arquette & Jason Clarke. Jason Clarke doesn't get the recognition he deserves. As for what I have seen thus far, there is just so much padding to prolong what we already know. Nothing new is revealed. There is just a lot of fictionalized conversations & just fictional stuff in general. This story could have been told in 4 episodes because it isn't offering anything new. The story just got more of the 'Hollywood' treatment. The timeline is not accurate because they wanted to make her a part of the story when she wasn't. Alex Murdaugh is already vile enough without making up stuff....and there is a lot of made up stuff. And I was really disgusted by the 'sex' scene between Alex and Maggie. Was that necessary to the story....no! But the part that I find the most hypocritical is that I used to listen to Mandy Matney (whose podcast this series is based on) and she did bring this story to life & made it impossible for the boat crash story & then the murders to get swept under the rug. She received much recognition & kudos for the work she did. Well deserved. However, like has happened before, all that went straight to her head. I had to stop listening to her because she reminds you every chance she gets how much integrity she has, her self importance & her self righteousness will make you want to puke. But, she's obviously okay with all the fiction is in this series she has been hawking for months. How does maligning a dead woman scream integrity? Also how long is she going to continue to monetize this tragic story because she never lets her listeners know how important she was to this story. I think 3 episodes is enough to know not to waste anymore time.",literal
"A fine festive film 'How the Grinch Stole Christmas' is solid, it makes for a fine festive film despite a few slow-paced moments.

"Clark Finally Wins As someone who went to the theatre in '89 to see this, and had it on VHS, then DVD when it was available, I still watch this every Christmas Season. It's definitely in my top 5 Christmas movies, and my top 20 comedies.

So what could I possibly add in 2020, that hasn't been mentioned before? Not much.

Still, as I watch this for the millionth time (thank you cable TV and legal weed), I've decided to officially chime in.

After an arguably disappointing sequel, this third 'Vacation' instalment comes back with a super-clutch performance. Think 'walk off home run, in the bottom of the ninth to win the game', level of salvation.

As a fan of National Lampoon during its heyday, this was such a nice 'win' for the franchise. Even though by that point, The Lampoon was past it's prime, this movie really tied a bow on the Doug Kenney (RIP)/Chevy Chase era. See 'A Futile and Stupid Gesture' for more info.

Chevy deserves all the praise for this performance. It's the culmination of all his best roles-from SNL, Caddyshack, Spies Like Us, Three Amigos, and two Vacation movies. It's crazy that this is arguably the last time he is considered funny, or leading man material. The 90's and beyond were not kind to him.

Although, that could be karma. The stories are plentiful and unfortunate. But that does not change his impact on American Comedy, because that is undeniable.

So here he is, at the end of a decade in which he has seemingly proven to 'critics' that his decision to leave SNL for Hollywood, was the right one. Chevy in the 80's was a powerhouse, and here he is in '89, still killing it.

Same goes for Beverly D'Angelo. My goodness I had such a crush on her. She is so amazing in this film, and she often steals the scenes. She's the glue of the franchise, and her on screen chemistry with Chase is never better, than in this movie. She plays 'straight' comedy and the blissfully resigned, so well.

When she clues into the Christmas Lights situation, it's so hilarious...every time. Her facial expressions are next level.

I mean, Ellen and Clark's scenes are the only good thing about the second 'Vacation' movie, in my opinion.

I love that they lean into the circumstances surrounding the decision to have different actors portraying the kids. (See trivia section for European Vacation)

As much as I love the original duo, I always feel this siblings pairing was the best. Their comedic sensibilities are fantastic.

I also loved meeting the various parents, grandparents and of course, the amazing Eddie and Catherine are fantastic as usual.

I love that Brian Doyle Murray is in this.

I love that when I first saw Seinfeld, I said: ""That's the girl from Christmas Vacation!"".

I love that the actress who played Aunt Bethany, Mae Questel, is the real-life Betty Boop.

I love that rant from Clark, regarding his bonus. It NEVER gets old.

I love that the ending for this movie, was the original ending in the FIRST Vacation movie.

I hate that they didn't end this franchise, here. This should've been the final chapter, because Clark finally wins!

He finally creates the 'perfect' family experience.

While the original Vacation will always be my favourite, this one is decimal points away, in comedic value.",figurative
A good Christmas movie A decent Christmas movie without the usual Hallmark cringe. Made me laugh genuinely a few times and had a nice Christmas spirit. I was pleasantly surprised. Good acting and good actors. Will it win a Oscar ? No. Will it give you a cozy Christmas watching experience without feeling plastic hallmark Christmas? Yes! Recommend for watching with loved ones during the holidays.,literal
"Average story The story was average or even better, but the tricks were awful. They have done better tricks back in 60's in Hollywood. Especially the moving of the ""beast"" was anything but credible. Too bad it spoiled the promising movie.",literal
"Watching it just for Jason Bateman and not the boring plot The storylines are all over the place-they can't seem to focus on just one. And honestly, it doesn't have to revolve around the girl. It should have been about two brothers trying to get their lives together. I really love the brotherhood, which is why I didn't rate this show a 4 out of 10. I thought I was going to see Jason on a heroic journey alongside his brother. I'm clearly disappointed.",figurative
"Ben Mendelsohn should have been 'Roofman' This feel-good crime caper works hard to convince us that serial McDonald's bandit Jeffrey Manchester - or ""Roofman"" - was really just a misunderstood nice guy. Channing Tatum brings charisma and heart to the role, but the film stretches credibility when the trigger for his spree is his daughter's disappointment over a Meccano set. It's a sympathy grab that doesn't quite land.

Tatum's performance is undeniably sharp, full of warmth and charm, yet it's hard not to imagine how much darker and more layered the film could've been with Ben Mendelsohn in the lead. He plays Pastor Ron here, radiating the same quiet menace that made him unforgettable in Animal Kingdom - and in doing so, quietly steals his scenes.

Peter Dinklage is deliciously ruthless as a Toys ""R"" Us tycoon, while Kirsten Dunst gives the film its emotional core as the perpetually imperilled romantic interest, a role straight out of her Spider-Man era.

Still, for all its glossy pacing and rom-com energy, the ending feels like a cheat - a ""genius"" criminal undone by a bafflingly dumb move. The filmmakers might have been wiser to label it ""Based on a true story"" and let fiction take the reins.",literal
"A Relentless March into Fear and Survival The Long Walk (2025), directed by Francis Lawrence, is an unsettling blend of horror, sci-fi, and dystopian thriller that asks a haunting question: how far would you go, and is it really worth it? Adapted from Stephen King's 1979 novel written under the pseudonym Richard Bachman, the film carries forward the author's raw and uncompromising vision but introduces a few fresh angles that make it stand apart from the source material.

The story centers on a brutal contest where teenagers are forced into a life-or-death march. The rules are terrifyingly simple-keep walking, or be executed by the military escort shadowing their every move. Cooper Hoffman takes on the role of Raymond Garraty, with David Jonsson as Peter McVries, and both deliver grounded performances that capture the emotional and physical toll of this relentless ordeal. The supporting cast of young actors also does justice to their roles, though it's the intense premise that truly drives the film forward.

Interestingly, the movie does not stick entirely to King's bleak, solitary meditation on survival. Instead, it explores themes of love, sacrifice, and rebellion against oppressive authority. This shift might divide audiences-purists may miss the unrelenting despair of the book, while others may find the added emotional arcs more relatable and cinematic. One cannot ignore the eerie similarity to Suzanne Collins' The Hunger Games. In fact, this adaptation makes it even clearer that King's novel might have been a twisted inspiration behind Collins' dystopian saga.

From a technical standpoint, the film holds steady. Lawrence's direction ensures that the pacing never falters, and J. T. Mollner's screenplay balances brutality with emotion. The cinematography captures both the vast, desolate landscapes and the suffocating intensity of the march, while the editing and background score add to the film's oppressive atmosphere. Though performances are fairly good, it's really the mood and narrative weight that carry the film.

Overall, The Long Walk is gripping, gruesome, and deeply emotional. While not flawless, it succeeds in making viewers question endurance, humanity, and the cost of survival. For thriller and dystopian fans, it is worth the watch.

Rating: 7/10.",literal
Copaganda nonsense Really tired of seeing shows like this on TV. Just get it off the air. All these shows do is set people up when the police investigate them and help them incriminate themselves.

"Bittersweet pieces of life ""The Big C"" walks on the thin line. Comedy and drama, love and lack of love, sweet but in the end has to be bitter. The creators and producers have to be talented if they want to walk that way and till now they really are. Laura Linney is simply great. She always is, but now is more than ever. She makes the situations easy to be watched because the subject is complicated and can hurt a lot. But instead of suffering with it, we enjoy everything what's happening: we smile, we feel. Feeling, being touched by honest emotions, is something you don't get all days, not in shows and either in real life. ""The Big C"" doesn't deserve only a good chance, it deserves the fidelity you give to big shows and this is one of them. Try it and you won't regret it.",literal
"Superman Is back!!!! This is, without a doubt, the best Superman movie since Christopher Reeve brought the Man of Steel to life and set the gold standard for what the character should represent.

James Gunn has delivered a story that respects the past while boldly shaping the future. The emotion, the symbolism, and the heart are all there. Thank you, Gunn, for reminding us why the world still needs Superman. This is the beginning of something truly special. The real Superman is finally back. Im in love with this!",literal
"Final good season ahead, and then it's downhill... I expect the 3rd (and final season of The Witcher that I'll ever watch) to be a good one - chiefly so because of Henry Cavill. To have an actor with his resources and his love for the source material WANT to play Geralt is trully a God-send. I've already downloaded the Henry Cavill face extensions for all my Witcher games; in my mind's eye he will always be Geralt. It is absolutely mind-boggling that having him, having the other cast members, the producers made the decision to slaughter the goose that lays golden eggs. I suspect this will top the blunder of Firefly in terms of fans and revenue lost. With all the love I have for Liam - he is simply not Geralt, and no amount of make up, white wigs or leathery body armour can change that. R. I. P., best fantasy ever brought to life. It's been a good run. One day, in a decade or few, perhaps a new hero will rise, loving the original story as Henry does, hopefully having at least a fraction of Henry's looks and dedication to this character, and we'll give it another go. Hopefully I'll live to see that day.",literal
"The second season redeemed the first one The second season is much better than the first. Finally, the tracker is starting to live up to the series' name - and we see more trackers, a little more survival, spatial awareness that suits the terrain, and even more eccentric characters who live in the wild.

There is still a lot to improve, but it is definitely a change for the better As someone who decided to watch this series just because of the name, I almost created it in the first season which was not at all related to nature and outdoor skills; But I'm happy that my hope that the central element I was looking for in the series really appears more and more in the second season and it also makes all the stories in the series much more interesting and cool. For those who have the patience to endure the first season and wait for the second, it is recommended.",literal
"Slightly updated, partial retelling of Stephen King's massive tome It's 1988, and a group of young teens in the town of Derry, Maine are terrorized by an otherworldly clown named Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard), who can make them see their worst fears. They must band together to stop the fiend before it kills them all.

King's novel succeeded in large part due to the nostalgic immersion into Baby Boomer cultural touchstones. The filmmakers decision to update the setting to the late 1980's is understandable in the sense that the follow-up, featuring the adult versions of the characters, will now chronologically fit with modern times. The filmmakers also decide to forgo any excessive wallowing in 1980's pop iconography, with a movie poster here and a song there the only references. That boils the story down to the horror film essentials, and while there's nothing original in the mix, it is well presented, and features a handful of memorable scare moments. The special effects are also largely successful, and Skarsgard is good as the monstrous clown. The filmmakers also made the interesting decision to not explain Pennywise, perhaps leaving that for the sequel. I'd be curious what a first time viewer, with no knowledge of the source novel or the previous 1990 TV mini-series version, thought of the story.

I recently caught up with the first season of the TV series Stranger Things, which almost certainly had some impact on this film version of It, even going so far as to cast one of the show's leads in this as well. That's not a problem, though, as that kid (Wolfhard) is good in both, and the rest of the cast in this is also terrific, with Lillis, as the sole girl in the group, and the aforementioned Wolfhard, as the foul-mouthed jokester, the stand-outs.",literal

"Crazy and Kooky As a lover of all things 'Burton',and the works of Gough and Millar I was hoping this might be good.....I was not disappointed...I was intrigued to see if Ms Ortega could slip into Wednesday's shoes,(..as well his C Ricci did...nice to see her in it,also...my wife did not believe it was her when I pointed her out...),but she most certainly did,brilliantly and assured. We are 4 episodes in and loving every second of this superb show. It's refreshingly messaging free,(..unlike most of Hollywoods present day output..),and the cast is uniformly likeable. Add good script and plenty of laughs and chills,all add up to a sure fire Winner. Thanks Tim and all concerned.......... .......Fast forward to August 2025 and we've just blitzed first four eps of season 2 and happy to report quality is as good if not better than season 1..nice additions to the cast in Mr S Buscemi and Miss J Lumley,(..as magnetic as ever..)...can't wait for next 4 eps...Very,very enjoyable, mildly scary,(..possibly..), gothic horror fantasy comedy show......",literal

"Was Taylor Sheridan Was Taylor Sheridan involved in the first season, as the difference between seasons is stark.

Season 2 smacks of classic Taylor Sheridan wooden dialogue, whereas Season 1 was much better.

Not really sure of the point of the show now - if a place like Kingstown existed in the real world then the US would be a broken state - but even as an slightly over the top crime drama it no longer works.

The show needs put to sleep, whether it would have been before Renner's accident I doubt it, as Sheridan vehicles are all over TV at the moment and much of it is tedious predictable schmaltz.

Its a shame as Season 1 was genuinely good.",literal
"Really Great I have never watched a show that is as consistently genuine and engaging as Breaking Bad. This is undoubtedly one of the greatest shows ever, and it consistently improves as it progresses.

The Journeys of Walter White and Jesse Pinkman are unforgettable. These are some of the best-written characters to ever come from a pen-hitting paper.

My praises for the acting and cinematography are unending. Some of the shots are intricate works of art, and I was rarely distracted by the acting. The performances are excellent to the extent that it feels improper to refer to them as performances.

Overall, Breaking Bad consistently maintains a level of engagement and technical quality seen in only the best of movies, and in terms of tone, every intense moment is executed with excellence and always achieves the impact it reaches for.

I feel like the show's plot in the early seasons lacks a certain level of complexity due to it not having a vast amount of plot threads, and the start is a bit slow-paced, but Breaking Bad is an absolute must-watch. If you have mixed feelings towards Season 1, trust me, it is only uphill from there.

If there was ever a series you could call perfect, I think this might be it.",figurative
"Writing Room needs someone under 35 Ok... nothing on the screen is as attractive as an intelligent lead character.

As someone who lived a life of holding back when people dissed my intelligence because of ""how I looked"", I love how she doesn't hold back when taking the air outta their balloons. But really, put a writer under 35 in the room.",literal
"Why Stella Kidd Ruins the Fun in Chicago Fire As a long-time fan of Chicago Fire, I've realized that not every character fits seamlessly into Firehouse 51, and Stella Kidd is a prime example of this mismatch. While the writers clearly intended her to be a strong leader, her portrayal often leaves the audience questioning her authority and role in the team. Her promotion to lieutenant feels rushed and unearned, as true leadership in a firehouse comes from demonstrated skill and earned respect, yet the show expects us to believe she is authoritative without showing the experiences to justify it. Somewhere in the show, her leadership role turned into a bossy kind of attitude, and the way she leads Truck 81 undermines the authority and legacy of Casey, the very firefighter who made Truck 81 the benchmark for the firehouse. The Stella Kidd character is portrayed like a Fairy Godmother, as if without her the firehouse would not survive, even though it was functioning perfectly fine long before she arrived. To be honest, my love for the show dropped a little after she became lieutenant. She exhibits a know-it-all attitude that clearly shouts ego rather than leadership, and to be fair, she hasn't endured the trials that other characters have to deserve such a spotlight. In so many places, the show sings her praises, implying her reputation precedes her - but ""what reputation""? Compared to the other firefighters, she has not done enough to earn that kind of mega-star display. Watching episodes after her promotion has not been a joy ride; the show is supposed to be a source of relaxation and fun, yet her presence often brings tension instead. Unless the writers reshape her character into someone more grounded and authentic, Stella Kidd in her current form injects negativity into the show and its fanbase rather than value.",literal
"A Blast to Watch, Despite Being Predictable. ""Nobody 2"" serves as a good sequel that doesn't rely on the first film. You can watch it as a standalone and enjoy it just as much, although understanding the lore and world the narrative exists in would be beneficial for any true movie buff, so watching the first film is always recommended.

The film's premise is a simple one: Hutch, a hired assassin working off a debt, finds that his work is starting to interfere with his home life. His wife is drifting, he has no idea what his kids are up to, and he struggles to keep up with his chores and responsibilities. He decides to take a break and take his family on a vacation to Plummerville, a small town of which he has fond childhood memories. But as usual, trouble seems to find Hutch, as he stumbles into a town involved in drugs, chemicals, and kidnapping. Hutch reluctantly goes back to work, as it is the only way to keep his family safe on their vacation.

This movie doesn't attempt to reinvent the wheel, nor does it try to copy the inspiration before it (the John Wick series). Instead, it takes the idea of a summer vacation flick and then asks, ""But what if Chevy Chase had a particular set of skills?"" It is a story that may be forgotten in the long run, but every time you watch it, the movie will bring a smile to your face.

Bob Odenkirk again carries the film with the look and feel of your typical ""everyman"". He's in good shape, but not built like a Stallone or a Schwarzenegger, and he really gives off the sense of a man in the wrong place at the wrong time. Connie Nielsen gives a great portrayal of a loving wife, and she shines when her character has to have doubts or frustrations in her significant other. Christopher Lloyd serves up some laughs as usual, especially since he is portraying an 87 year old gatling gun operator. Its nice to see some range by John Ortiz (Fast and Furious, Miami Vice), and Sharon Stone is brought back into the spotlight, only this time she is not a love interest but a crazed villain.

The production quality here is outstanding, doing a great job of capturing the magic of an American small town in the middle of summer. The arcade, waterpark, and fair are sure to serve up some nostalgia to anyone that goes to see this film. The music selection also screams classic summer. The cinematography and color palette are excellent, with lots of yellows, greens, and blues. The choice of weaponry is a blast, as the good guys use an armory that seems to be lifted straight out of WW2. I said it before with ""Ballerina (2025)"", but I'll restate it here: it is so nice to see action movies being treated as more than just shoot-em-ups. The camerawork and production value continue to improve, and I am here for it.

The action here is fun, and it doesn't take itself as serious as a John Wick movie. It strikes a great blend of realism and entertainment, with some kill sequences that are sure to make you laugh. They have also made some creative decisions to not show all of the action, as there are times where you only hear what is happening, rather than always seeing it. Some viewers will like this, and some will not. It is all about your taste and preference.

If I had to point out any negatives, which would definitely be nitpicking, I would say first that the final act has been done many times before. The climactic fight scenes are pulled straight out of the ""Home Alone (1990)"" playbook, with our heroes booby trapping the fairground like Kevin Malone did his own house. This is not the first time we have seen this borrowed, as James Bond did it in ""Skyfall (2012)"" and John Rambo did it in ""Rambo: Last Blood (2019)"". Additionally, Sharon Stone's character does not get much of an exposition, and often times comes across as over-the-top yet somewhat forgettable. And while I appreciated the corrupted Sheriff played by Colin Hanks getting what he deserved, I couldn't help but feel disappointed in how it was done.

Is it cliche? Absolutely. Is it predictable? You bet. But is it a blast to watch? 100%, from start to finish.

Final Rating: 8.4/10.",figurative
"GREAT watch! Relevant as ever today! To start - I was SO stoked to see Jack Gleason in this show. He is a PHENOMENAL actor and to hear he had quit acting because of GOT fans who hated Joeffry so much that they literally buried him is wild?! That just speaks to his unmatched talent!!

Anyways, there is a long list of great actors in this and not gonna lie - The greedy billionaire ahhhats of today could learn a thing or two from the Guinness way. Working class folks aren't like them. MOST people just want to be able to support their families and not be constantly waiting to lose everything... Our world could be so much better, if only greedy pricks could be just a TINY bit less greedy!",literal
"A lovely ride, until the end. ""Have you ever watched Gilmore Girls?"" It's what my friend said when she recommended me this show while were discussing my tumultuous family relations. She said: ""Give it a shot, you might find it surprising how much you can relate to these characters, their journeys and struggles."" Said and done.

I have just finished watching the show and the last episode had me crying from beginning to end, and this is a statement to the most powerful asset the show has: the ability to make us relate and sympathize with the characters. This is a show about relationships: family, friends and love, plus we get to see one the main characters go through high school and college, and who can't relate to those things?! Life is tough and relationships are hard, but to still believe in your goals and dreams despite it all is what this show is all about.

The Gilmore Girls: Lorelai's character (the mom) is the soul of the entire show, her dysfunction relationship with her parents, the hard work put into building her life and independence, the love, care and trust (even if a bit idealized) she shares with her daughter is a wonder to see, she is a living and breathing compulsive joker that made me laugh out loud so many times I lost count, and all of it lets us connect with her in so many levels.

Rory's character (the daughter) is the one everyone wish they were: has good grades, likes to study, is ambitious and above it all has in her mother a best friend and a partner. As she comes of age, we get to see a lot we can relate to: first love, first time, getting to college, existential crisis (every college kid has at least one), graduation and the uncertainties that lies ahead of adulting around.

Emily's character (the grandmother) is the one that makes us understand why all of us gotta go to therapy: because our parents didn't. She is also the reason one of the most iconic parts of the show exists, the Friday night dinners with Lorelai and Rory. The dinners are almost a synthesis of the entire show where these three women, who lead absolutely different lives and want completely different things from one another, try to get together and figure out a way to be a family.

The show is pretty clever in depicting the impact family support can have on someone as well as the result family disfunction can inflict on somebody, and that's what family is all about. But don't get me wrong, sometimes the very lesson the show is trying to teach about the importance of clear communication, and the problems with misinterpretation and assumptions are sometimes used for a lack of better writing, especially concerning Lorelai and Rory's romantic interests throughout the show and are very often frustrating and out of character.

It has a lot of great side characters and the tone and dynamic between them all shifts a bit from season 4 forward. It's a nice depiction of the small-town way of life and has a rare yet kind and considerate take on relationships between generations (grandma, mother and daughter). All and all Gilmore Girls is an up lifting, feel-good and cozy show. I loved this journey and I genuinely think it made me realize and change the way I see myself and deal with my family issues (and all of it while having a good time!). Hope a lot of people give it a shot, because it's definitely worth it.",figurative
"Annoying characters Landman reminds me of Yellowstone but with new characters in a new location.

The show goes very slow at times and shows mundane day to day activities. Then it will pick up with Angela (ex-wife) trying to act tough or sexy or the 17 year old daughter being hyper-sexual (this is a slightly disturbing aspect). They who scenario of Angela and Ainsley working at the nursing home as activity planners is just ludicrous. Who wrote this crap? Taylor Sheridan must hate women. He seems to portray them in over the top, unattractive ways that just shout crazy. It's an insult to women. Billy Bob does a great job as Tommy. I enjoy the storyline with his son and the battles he is facing.

The whole show would be improved if Angela and Ainsley were killed off. Sorry.",literal
"Jurrasic Mess Yes, I've seen all of the films in this series. Since the first film, all of the rest of the series have declined in. Viewing pleasure. It would be interesting to have a serious director and a serious writer have a shot at this series with no kids, no dysfunctional families, and no cuddly dinosaurs.

The plusses are the cinematography, the sets, and the sound design, and occasionally, some of the acting.

The minuses include the dysfunctional family, the young child, the cuddly dinosaur, the skullasaurus, etc. One might posit that the opening scene is the best part of the film.

A personal gripe of mine is how ships are portrayed in film. In a brief scene, the sails are luff but the sailboat is still merrily sailing along. A sailboat of the size would have a very heavy keel which would have kept the boat upright and would not allow it to be at 90 or 180 degrees out of orientation.",literal
"Still a worthy sequel, even with weak writing Hutch Mansell is back in action, and this time creating chaos on a family vacation.

The sequel to 2022 sleeper hit, Nobody 2 follows the similar route of it's predecessor - a family life, monotonous routine and then boom there's action and drama everywhere. There's a clear picture to keep the spirit of the original alive, while establishing a place of it's own.

The writing is weak, although the action choreography remains the constant. The antagonist in the form of Sharon Stone was thinly written, though the performance was visibly good. The main danger with these types of movies is that all the fighting and shooting and snapping and stabbing and exploding will feel predictable or anonymous in a universe where action movies have become mere background noise. Despite of the weaknesses, Nobody 2 still does good due to standard formula and pretty crazy last act.

Overall, Nobody 2 is a still good sequel to watch - silly and predictable but funny enough to make you sit for 90 minutes.

My Rating : 3.5/5.",literal

"Overall quite good..some glaring historical inaccuracies I've been enjoying the series. Last evening (episode 3) it was represented that General Howe, during the Battle of Long Island, had left his campfires lit to deceive Washington as to his army's intentions to fall on the Patriots by surprise. I said to my wife "" I didn't know that"" and went onto tell her that Washington had used the same ploy to deceive Howe when he subsequently withdrew from Long Island to Manhattan. ""Did Washington learn a trick from Howe I speculated"". The fact that Washington's campfire deception was never mentioned in the episode left me surprised. Following the show I went to my large history library and found numerous references of Washington's campfire deception, but none of Howe's. I also noted several other inaccuracies ( mostly omissions and slants). But, this is only my editorial opinion.

I am not an amateur historian and hold several degrees in history, taught history and was a Fellow at Yale University where I developed and published curriculum for public schools under Yale's auspice. I should add that this period of history is not my specialty and in the early 80's went on to pursue a new career in vertical flight where i was named an Honorary Fellow of the Vertical Flight Society(a distinctive honor awarded to only two persons worldwide annually). I'm retired now for many years and continue to pursue my many and varied interests.

"Running Into Reality: This Remake Is Edgier And Less Campier O Sienna Benn LIKES: New Style And Vision Funny Humor In Various Forms.

Moves Quickly Exciting At Points Great Messages Wonderful Music The Acting Is Choice Summary: Another Stephen King plot brought to life, the modern-day approach has captured the dark storytelling that the author is known for. A wonderful world that blends fantasy and fact together, the new age has crafted a much deeper and believable world that feels much like the dystopian future King's writer predicts. Flashy and futuristic, but not to the point of some fantasy, the new city feels very real, which helps add to the darkness of King's world, giving this version its own feel. The new camera work drums up more of the new feel, with a direction that gears towards three different perspectives in this game show created for the masses. Whether I was an audience member, an exec, or the player, this film coordinated its time and energy to successfully pull the movie together, unleashing a dynamic display of chaos. I think this movie was striving to show off.

What does all of this accomplish? Well, it's a spectacle that does feel very much attuned to an adventure at the movie theater...at least at the start. The Running Man remake is loaded with elements that make the theater a good place to view. The music adds those elements of intensity, a vibrant rock and roll-themed track list that accompanies the symphony work that embodies the edginess of the movie. Action scenes are fast and hectic, gun fights and close combat from the trailers, a fair assessment of the chaos to come if you choose to watch it. They hold merit, and don't defy reality too much, which helps add that excitement to the chaos at hand. Amidst the intense battles and high-speed chases, there is plenty of comedy to feast upon, delivered in various styles with a cast who knows how to mix things up. You want aggressive challenges to the higher orders via provocative gestures and excessive cursing? Powell's character has you covered. You need street-smart antics and well-researched information about the broken system? The film has that too! How about neurotic conspiracy theories? Yep, has that too. It's a nice (if slight) release of the pressure, but it was one of the movies I've laughed a lot at in recent times to the films. And somehow, it has great messages that hit hard, all these elements working to arrive at the final third of the movie, where the truth begins to ring out. A tad cheesy at times, the movie uses some cliché moments to get the words out, but with solid delivery and the right support, the messages sank deep with me to try and be better. As for the acting that makes all of it come to life, Powell is continuing to be a fun actor to watch. He blends a lot into this role, primarily the aggressive side of fighting against the network with an intensity that is present in punch, smolder, and the presentation of every word. Other times, he opens that softer and funnier side, which always felt at home and seldom felt forced in as they continued to flesh this character out. The other characters not billed in the top three accomplish much, with several other secondary and tertiary characters an awesome display of the eccentric world that the U. S. is portrayed as. And though it is scary and haunting, it was done with a precise quality I myself like to see.

DISLIKES: Character Balance Is Mundane Conveniences Are Too Much Dark/Depressing Lacks The Same Campiness A Bit Too Close To Home Language/Gestures Hyperaggressive Not As Fun As the First Summary: Where the movie starts to feel off for me is that the movie seems to be too chaotic and realistic, so I'm not getting lost in the film like the 1987 version. For one thing, the character balance is mundane. Heavy hitters like our protagonist and primary antagonist get more than enough time, but other characters feel very lost, forgotten, and disconnected. They serve their purpose, but the haphazard use of characters and rushed time with them felt somewhat disappointing given what they could have been. In addition, the movie feels a bit too convenient at times, each of them adding up with a plot armor that gets a bit too lazy for me. Throw in the realistic focus I was given, and you get to another complaint of how dark and depressing it felt. Arnold's movie had its fair share of hard-to-watch moments, but the campiness and fun factor helped to alleviate the horror. Given the current times, this film is going to hit a lot harder than the other one, and the escape from reality is far less prevalent than I would have liked, which sometimes seems to be King's plan. As that enraging energy pours from the screen, the movie's hyperaggressive language and gestures get tiring for me. Don't get me wrong, some of them are awesome, but eventually the writing grows too fixated on that for me that it loses the magic. For those who are even more sensitive to such things, I strongly advise watching this film to avoid the overwhelming amount of expletives and debauchery to come. Finally, the movie may have a lot of quality elements, but I can't say it was unique, fun, or as standout as the storytelling they did in the original version. While this may not be what everyone wants, not having such unique hunters as the American Gladiator-like seekers from before was something I missed.

The VERDICT: The Running Man is another movie that gets a boost from modern times in many ways. All the technological prowess and improvements sculpt a world that is far more believable and haunting than I anticipated it would ever become, alongside the musical scores to amplify that energy. It has a lot more excitement and stakes to it, with a bit that holds far more of King's darkness than what the previous decades could inject. And the acting continues to show how the artistic style can improve and evolve to give us the splendor to rival what the world seems to be turning into (another benefit from the current times) that pulls all of this into such a visceral piece to watch. With that being sad, I missed the campiness and fun the first film had, especially in trying to escape the reality that the media keeps us entrenched in. The Running Man has a lot more weight to it, and I found myself wishing to either get lost in some brutal fist fights/chases, or at least have some more relief. Alas, this film chooses to stick to the aggressive language, foreboding tones, and the conveniences that feel weaker to me than the unique schtick they chose back in the day. Throw in the characters feel less connected with the haphazard handoffs, limited time, but for a few, and feeling the time ratios were off compared to the potential. However, if you can stomach the darker motifs, handle the aggression, and get to the end, you'll find some inspirational messages that feel very geared toward a particular crowd. Worth the theater visit? Yes, I think so for the spectacle for this designated crowd. What are the scores? Here is what I grade The Running Man: Thriller/Comedy/Action/Dark Comedy/Sci-Fi/Adventure/Survival: 7.0-7.5 Movie Overall: 6.5-7.0.",figurative
"Addicted: Meth or Math. Drug wars, meth, the lot. I thought no thank you. I kept hearing how good it was and I kept saying: ""No thank you"" Last January I got sick, one of those illnesses you can't quite figure out.

"Engaging, Tense, Outstanding!! Season 1

This series sets environment right from the start of its first episode. The plot of the series is very interesting. Storyline keeps you engaged. The Duffer Brothers has directed the series so well. Each and every scene looks completely new. As the series progresses the environment becomes so tense and scary. It keeps you at the edge of your seat.

The acting is outstanding from the entire cast. Each character has portrayed its role with absolute perfection.

The background music is excellent. Visual effects are also good. In the tense and scary scenes background score makes your spine chill.

Overall, ""Stranger Things"" is a must watch series!

Season 2

Second season is a good continuation of the first season. Storyline is good this time also. In second season bond between characters is shown beautifully. There's much time given for character development so we feel more connected to the characters this season. Last few episodes are very tense and you will be thrilled by the climax.

Season 3

Problem is now bigger to face. This season is very interesting to watch. Waiting for the fourth season...",literal

He's got something that the rest of the characters seem to be missing. The female counterpart , can't remember her name she doesn't seem to have the chemistry with him that I think they are ultimately supposed to have .

"Superb take on one of the most twisted family sagas of our time Definitely one of the most superbly-acted and perfectly-cast dramas I've seen in a long time. Both Jason Clarke and Patricia Arquette are fantastic as the principles in this twisted family saga. Clarke deftly alternates between forced joviality and drug-induced rages, while Arquette also manages the fine line between forced optimism and utter despair.

Also worthy of note is Johnny Berchtold as Paul and Kathleen Wilhoite as Gloria. Both weave in and out as they see their lives collapsing around them. The rest of the supporting cast is excellent too. Hulu knocked it out of the park with this one.",literal
"We NEED a sequel! The visuals were incredible, the story was amazing and moving, and the characters were all unique and fun and I loved them all. I kept hearing about it and decided to check it out and I'm so glad I did. Also, I cannot stop listening to the songs from this film! They absolutely sound like songs that kpop groups would sing.",literal
"Not the best of ""Superman"" movies... Of course I had to check out the 2025 movie ""Superman"", from director James Gunn, as I did grow up with the Christopher Reeve movies, and of course have watched all subsequent ""Superman"" movies as well, plus a lot of the animated movies. Though, I have to admit that the superhero genre is not my go-to genre for means of entertainment.

James Gunn did deliver an entertaining enough rendering of the character that was created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster. It is a popcorn movie, visually pleasing, but not one that challenges the audience's intellect in any way. There are simply too many sub-plots in the narrative, and most of them felt they are just brushed over without director James Gunn delving deeper into the sub-plots and giving it the attention and time it needs to be explored properly and brought to the screen. And that made the movie felt rather superficial and rushed, leaving way too many things answered in subpar manners. Director James Gunn simply tried to juggle too many balls here and didn't do a particular good job at it.

Something that really impressed me about the movie was the cast ensemble. There were a lot of familiar and good talents on the cast list. I will say that I think that leading actor David Corenswet actually carried the ""Superman"" mantle quite well, and he performed nicely in the movie. The acting performances in the movie were good.

I think that Hawkgirl (played by Isabela Merced) was a nice addition to the movie, and Krypto was also a fun addition to the franchise. As for Guy Gardner (played by Nathan Fillion) and Mr. Terrific (played by Edi Gathegi) not so much.

The character gallery in the movie felt somewhat superficial. You don't really get to know any of the characters. Sure, Superman, Clark Kent, Lois Lane, the adoptive parents, Lex Luthor and Jimmy Olson was a given that you would know in advance. But if you never seen a ""Superman"" movie or animated movie or read a comic book, then writer and director James Gunn didn't do a particular thorough job of letting newcomers into the universe. In fact, a lot of the characters in the movie felt two-dimensional and seemed to be there just because they were written to be there. Many characters were lacking personalities, motivations, drives, etc.

Visually, then ""Superman"" was nice. The special effects were good, and it looked realistic. Well, as realistic as you would assume from a movie with a flying invincible alien person with super powers. And with ""Superman"" being a superhero movie, of course having believable effects is a make or break sort of thing, so thankfully the special effects and CGI team worked wonders here.

The sounds were good, and the music score was good. I really liked the return to the original superman theme, because it was nostalgic and just felt like it belonged in a ""Superman"" movie, even a new one.

Enjoyable for what it was, a popcorn movie. Sure, I was entertained throughout the nearly two hours that the movie ran for. I wasn't overwhelmed or in awe, nor is it a movie that I think I will ever sit down to watch a second time. I will say that when the movie ended, I sat with a sense of 'this movie had potential to be so much more.' I felt a bit disappointed with the overall outcome of the movie.

My rating of writer and director James Gunn's 2025 movie ""Superman"" lands on a six out of ten stars.",figurative
"Often funny, sometimes stupid I did not think I would enjoy this series. It was completely entertaining. The all star cast, most notably Carol Burnett did an exceptional job. Carol Burnett was given an opportunity, in her 90's to perform her comedic routine that has been applauded for decades. The plot was engaging and kept me going back. I was only disappointed in one episode, I don't want to spoil it but it involves Allison Janney, Kristen Wiig and a mammal. That whole segment was dumb. I, unlike others thought the end was fitting . Overall I laughed, was entertained and finished this unique series. Yes- give the Emmy to Carol Burnett.",literal
"This show is so ridiculous Any American-based medical drama that doesn't start with a miserable person wheeling one of those insurance-information carts into a patient's room is going to take several large leaps away from reality - that's a given. And if you've ever had any illness more complicated than stitches, you know there's absolutely zero chance a crack team of physicians is burning the midnight oil in order to pin down exactly what ailment brought you to the ER. Still, no one is going to watch a show about sitting in an ER waiting room for six hours before a doctor shrugs their shoulders, so they made this instead. It's a story about a doctor who hurt other people's feelings by doing things like trying to stop other doctors from killing patients, and then she's hit by a car and loses eight years of memory. This apparently earns her a demotion, becauser in this world there are no job protections. Instead, one of the doctor's who got his feelings hurt because his actions almost had consequences gets a promotion that no one questions, freeing up amnesia-doctor to commence a nonstop apology tour. No memory of the last 8 years, but totally trusts every story she hears about her status as a not-nice person. Questions you might ask yourself while watching this include: why is everyone being so mean to the person with amnesia? Why is everyone cagey around information about her life? What did she actually do beyond speak to people in clipped tones? Why does the social worker act more like a preacher? It was already cringe, but I opted to tap out after a storyline about someone performing their own rape kit, storing it, bringing the information forward years later, and then the police arrest the guy. I've worked as an advocate for victims of sexual assault; the writer of this episode clearly didn't even read a long form article about the legal process before writing this schlock, let alone talk to a victim, a cop, a lawyer, or anyone authorized to perform a rape kit. There's soap opera medical fantasy, and then there's complete and utter drivel that fully dismisses the complexity of rape cases, and how challenging it is for a victim to even see the person she's accusing arrested, let alone charged. There's stupid, and then there's stupid and offensive. Get Scott Wolf off this train, he doesn't deserve to be sentenced to this show.",figurative
"Explosive Premiere, Cerebral Follow-Up - Both Nail It Two episodes in, The Last Frontier has already nailed the balance between explosive action and cerebral thrills that most shows spend entire seasons chasing.

Ep 1 hits like a freight train... think Con Air meets The Fugitive with a villain smart enough to make you question who you're rooting for. Jason Clarke anchors it with worn-down authenticity, while Alaska's frozen wasteland becomes the perfect pressure cooker for paranoia.

Ep 2 downshifts intelligently, trading spectacle for psychological depth. The flashbacks add moral weight, and Havlock evolves from standard antagonist to genuinely complex threat. Sure, it's slower, but the character work earns every minute.

What impresses most? The show respects your intelligence. No hand-holding, no cheap shortcuts - just taut storytelling that knows when to punch and when to breathe.

If it maintains this momentum, we're looking at the year's best thriller.",figurative
"Crap ending to a meh series! This should have been better!

As it progressed, it was obvious Jack / Adam was a 'one-dimensional' character! He literally sleep-walked the 6 episodes!

Yes, you knew from the 1st. Minute Jamie / David was 'dead'! All that remained was almost 6 hours getting there!

As other reviewers have commented, ""plotholes to the moon and back"".

Damien, (my namesake), for one...simply forgotten about post-murder! As you do in thrillers!!

Incompetent cop!

Fast-forward to...the end...which was...simply...the end! No loop-back to the opening scene! Jack / Adam simply hopped a boat...and left the island!

Definitely no reason for Season 2!

Despite my being a Jack Whitehall 'as comedian' fan, this was not his finest hour as a serious actor! He was soooo one-dimensional! He needs Lee Strasberg!!!!",literal
"New Vegas Importance of flashbacks so far was extensive. In season one flashbacks told the story and connected it with the current story, as well as played the role in character development. One of the reasons why the season was so good.

So New Vegas does not mean actual New Vegas game that wrapped and had an end about 15 years prior to the show, while obviously as the characters go to New Vegas in season two which plot partially revolves around the location, we will get more of those quality, storytelling and character developing flashbacks. And how about that Fleet of Brotherhood airships? And the location one of them is hovering above?

First season was way more than good. Season two is looking more and more like an absolute banger!",literal
"Watson Has the Brains and Heart-But the Chemistry's DOA What gives Watson added depth-and elevates it beyond the expected-is its unique approach to Holmes. Rather than rehash the traditional detective genius, the show provides a rich, sometimes tragic backstory that re-centers the narrative through Watson's perspective. This inversion is bold and works beautifully. It adds gravitas and mystery, drawing the viewer in episode after episode.

However, where Watson stumbles is in its supporting cast. A hit show often lives or dies by its ensemble, and unfortunately, outside of Watson and Moriarty, the other characters feel flat or miscast. The chemistry between secondary characters lacks spark, and the dialogue between them rarely crackles the way it should. In a show where relationships and emotional stakes are key, this is a noticeable gap. Great shows-from House to The West Wing-work not just because of a magnetic lead, but because of the rich web of characters surrounding them. Here, that web feels frayed.

Still, Watson is a compelling, thoughtful drama with real narrative ambition. Its take on Holmes lore is one of the most intriguing in recent memory, and the lead performance alone is reason enough to watch. With sharper ensemble casting in future seasons, this could be more than just a great idea-it could be a classic. For now, it's a must-watch with the potential for something even greater.",literal
One of the freshest movies in a long time Aziz Ansaris Good Fortune is a fresh movie starring Keanu Reeves as an angel. The movie gives food for thought to various aspects of life not matter how you live it. The dialogue's are -as the movie itself- fresh. Especially the frames where Keanu Reeves is performing are brilliant and witty. It's casted perfectly. One could argue it's an eat the rich movie but it just plays with the idea. A fresh movie in a year with little fresh ideas. Go enjoy it in your local theater an rewatch it for a deeper dive later on a streamer.,literal
"The biggest problems why I think the ratings have dropped and how they could fix it The show is not great, but it's not bad. I think the biggest problem is it's focusing more on, then, and how it's affecting them psychologically. Which gives it more of that soap opera feel. The original NCIS currently also has the same problem. It seems every crime now is connected to one of them somehow. They should go back to the early episode. Where's more straight military driven. It took place more on navy ships and military bases. The film style that ncis origins has gives it more of a dark feel of the era. Just because it was like that doesn't mean you have to use that style. Turn up the contrast and make it a little more bright. Seems like the biggest problem. People have is with continuity issues. I don't think they should hold that too much against it too much.. The original NCIS also had continuity problems. The second episode of the first season were the paratrooper dies. When ducky shows up, he said it reminds him of a pinata he set up for his nephew. Which we later find out he doesn't have a nephew. We later find out he doesn't have brothers and sisters. Only a half brother, what's ducky lost contact with. I think if both NCIS origins and the original NCIS. Need to go back to more military driven standalone episodes. We're focused more on the crime. Not the actors themselves and how it's connected or affecting them. Like I said earlier, it gives it more of that soap opera. Feel then a crime show. Go back to your original military driven roots in standalone episodes. I think the ratings will go back up.",figurative
"Rough This is such a strange show.

If it was a just Niecy Nash, Teyana Taylor and Kim K., I'd think this was pretty good. For them.

But what on earth are Sarah Paulson, Naomi Watts and Glen flipping Close doing in this? Them (and an army of otherwise excellent actors in guest roles) being there just highlights how bad this show really is. The writing is so much beneath them, they must have been showered with money to have said yes to this.

Ryan Murphy must have had a stroke or something. I know we can't expect highbrow entertainment from him but usually at least it's solid writing. This however is like a Tyler Perry reject project. Just awful.",literal
"Someone is at fault Any story involving an abducted child would make any parent uneasy but the first couple of episodes pulled me in. The character development helped push the story forward. Sarah Snook is a brilliant actress. The episode where Columbo type Detective Alcaras (Michael Peña) was the lead character was one of my favourites in the series.

Plot holes began to appear in those early episodes, but what happened in Episode 6? It jarred so much I knew it must have been written by another writer. One obvious sign was the characters all began swearing where previously they had not. Did they not read the previous episodes scripts?

Some of the situations in the later episodes did come across as totally far fetched and implausible.

I'm sure most of us thought allowing an abducted child home after a traumatic experience with no Police liaison officers, counselling, proper outside security when the kidnapper was still at large with a gun was a bit of an oversight.

Shame as I would have rated this series a 9 up to episode 5.",literal
"Fascinating concept If you could suddenly relive the last 8 years, would you change anything? If you knew better would you make the same mistakes... would it go better or worse the second time around?

Superimpose that concept on a House-like medical show with interesting cases and a mysterious backstory and you have Doc.

It's devoid of any humour but the suspense and the examination of how our experiences shape our character and whether and to what extent we can reinvent ourselves has me hooked.

Plus the music is consistently on point. I'm hoping the actors develop a little more chemistry but this is still one of the best new shows of the season.",literal
"Love It!! We just got Netflex a couple weeks ago & I've discovered a whole new world of TV shows that I've never heard of but love. I'm not sure we get them in Canada.

To Kla46, who thought the show was unrealistic & that someone could not pull off keeping such a secret. I have an old friend, who I knew in elementary school, that kept her cancer a secret from everyone til the week she landed in the hospital & died shortly after. She kept it secret for over 2 years!!! She had a son, husband, 2 siblings, father & extended family who never knew til that last week.

I love the show because the character is doing things that are so different from how I think I would act. Cathy is so funny, annoying but endearing. Laura Linney is doing an amazing acting job.

My favourite character is her grumpy neighbour, Marlene. I love her straight forward talk. When she slapped some sense into Cathy, she became my hero. 

I have 3 more episodes to watch but I had to come on here to find out more about the actors. Gotta go watch the rest.",literal
"More bad a** action Its not as good as the first one, as most are not. But what is here is more or less the same feel as the first one as far as some of the action goes. Christopher Lloyd totally made this movie better for me, without him i dont think I would have liked it as much. Happy they gave him a bigger roll than the first movie.

"Amazing Series A great starcast, great story, nicely directed and good knowledge about the religion and their culture. Nice representation of an american side and their culture and the Judaism and the Jewish people. It is fun to watch, it can relate to Millanials and Genz, its a nice one time rom com movie to watch on a weekend. Will give it a 7.5 rating. Fun to watch, waiting for the second part, hope it carries the same amount of fun and love. The end was great and the characters are also relatable and fun to watch. Great acting, nicely directed and good story lineup.. I would recommend to watch if you are looking for the good romantic series to watch.",literal
"Hilarious. Like Superstore, but in a hospital I don't understand all of these 1 or 2 star reviews people keep giving? I think this show is hilarious. Superstore is probably one of my all time favorite TV shows and I've been craving something to fill that void ever since it ended and this show does just that. It includes two of the same cast members, and was made by the same creator. It is mockumentary style which is a slight difference to superstore, but I was also a huge Modern Family fan so I'm familiar with the format and quite enjoyed it in this scenario as well. The other cast members are great also and work together well. The first episode wasn't the best by any means but don't let that discourage you because it's been nothing but uphill ever since!",literal
"No wonder It is the Best Show on TV! The show has it all! Romance, drama, action, humor, you name it. It has been on since 2003! And it is the #1 drama, surpassing CSI on the CBS network, that also airs both dramas.

Mark Harmon is cast as the lead, LeRoy Jethro Gibbs. As he is a old school hero in the form of John Wayne. And that he cares about his team, despite not showing emotions. He is cool, calm, level-headed but sympathetic at the same time. And doesn't want his team either hurt. But not to mess up on their cases.

The supporting cast is just as good. As Michael Weatherly as the wisecracking Tony DiNizzo, Cote De Pablo as no-nonsense Ziva David the ex-Mossad agent, Sean Murray as Tim ""Probie"" McGee, the tech expert. And David McCallum(The Man from UNCLE) as the wise, witty Ducky, the team's medical examiner. 

But the one that steals the show is Pauley Perrette as comic relief, tech lab person Abby Schutto. As she steals the show from everybody with her wit, charm, and shows that she does care about Gibbs team. 

The show you just couldn't ask for more in this. With it all it has to offer. See the show yourself, in order to know what I mean.",figurative
"The first episode was enough Melodramatic and full of weak writing. Combined with a lack of knowledge of physics and airplanes (and lock picking), and unrealistic fight scenes, it comes across as less than mediocre in substance. I believe they were trying to appeal to too many types of viewers, instead of focusing on producing a quality series.",literal
"Samurai Royal Rumble? Love the idea of this show as a kinda Samurai Royal Rumble or Squid Game.

However, I found the editing of this show completely maddening. Literally anytime a good fight was about to start, it would cut away to all manner of inane discussion and political manoeuvring. Then we'd see about 5 seconds of the fight and it would cut away again.

Sometimes, the fight was cut away from and then not even returned to. Sometimes we didn't even see the fight at all. Look, the whole reason I'm watching this is to see samurais fight.

Kinda hilarious also how the main character is called the Slayer but spends most of the show not wanting to fight. More like the Delayer. The Hamlet of the samurai world.

The endless bureaucracy, politicking, yawn. Don't care. Focus on what people want. Swords a d samurais. Let's go.",literal
"Running turns into Walking The 2025 remake of The Running Man arrives with heavy expectations: to honor Stephen King's original novel while reimagining the cult 1987 Schwarzenegger film. What results, however, is a confused hybrid that struggles to find its identity, weighed down by sluggish pacing and a finale that feels more symbolic than earned.

From the outset, the film signals its ambition. The neon-soaked arenas and corporate dystopia aesthetics are striking, clearly designed to echo both King's bleak vision and the satirical flair of the original movie. Yet ambition alone cannot sustain momentum. Where the 1987 film sprinted with chaotic energy-outrageous villains, relentless action, and campy one-liners-the remake limps, bogged down by exposition and drawn-out transitions. The pacing is its greatest flaw: scenes linger too long, draining tension and leaving audiences waiting for a spark that never arrives.

The climax exemplifies this problem. Ben Richards' decision to kill CEO Dan Killian should land as a cathartic rejection of corruption. Instead, it feels abrupt, more like a narrative checkbox than an emotional crescendo. Killian's offer to corrupt Richards mirrors the novel's themes of systemic exploitation, but the film fails to build sufficient tension to make Richards' refusal resonate. The result is confusion rather than clarity, a finale that gestures toward rebellion without delivering its full weight.

Comparisons highlight the remake's shortcomings. King's novel is grim and uncompromising, ending in Richards' suicide attack against the Network. The 1987 film, by contrast, embraced spectacle, turning dystopia into a satirical bloodsport that entertained even as it critiqued. The remake tries to split the difference, aiming for seriousness while retaining blockbuster polish, but the tonal indecision leaves it hollow.

Ultimately, this Running Man feels like a guardian stripped of urgency: armored in ambition but moving too slowly to protect its own story. It lacks the tragic punch of King's novel and the chaotic fun of Schwarzenegger's film. Instead, it delivers a muddled vision that neither thrills nor devastates. For fans of the franchise, it's a disappointing race-one that stumbles before reaching the finish line.",literal
"Wow This television feast features an absolutely amazing cast. It's a deeply entertaining show that is surprisingly dark. While there is enough intrigue to keep the plot moving, I suspected the culprit early on, and I found the specific character's unlikeability to be a drawback. They come off as great at first, only to begin doing and exhiniting incredibly disturbing traits. Gradually you come to see them for who they are and then they get worse. The lead delivers an acting masterclass, masterfully cycling through joy, confusion, anger, sadness, fear, and dissociation. As the complex web of the narrative begins to unfold, it leaves the audience upset but utterly unwilling to look away.",literal
"Another movie I got tricked into seeing in theaters because of the hype Turns out it was just a slightly non-generic monster movie. I don't get why these kinds of films keep getting pushed like they're groundbreaking. Sure, it's a ""smart"" film on the surface, but really it's just typical Hollywood fare dressed up to feel more important than it is.

It wasn't awful, just not anything special. The ending felt chaotic and didn't really make logical sense. The movie built up tension for a while, but when it finally tried to deliver, it just kind of... existed. Not nearly as deep or meaningful as people are making it out to be.

Honestly, I don't understand how this thing is sitting at 99% on Rotten Tomatoes. Feels like another case of manufactured hype. Visually, it had some solid moments,especially the IMAX shots, but overall it was just decent.",literal
"Enough with the Flashbacks Already! Great storylines being ruined by trips down memory lane every few minutes..Give it a break, put it to rest and get on with the current storyline which is where the real interest is with viewers..These flashbacks served a purpose when smurf was in the story to flesh it out...At this point however, its absolutely ridiculous to keep forcing them down viewers throats... just stop.",literal
"Thank god I decided to give this a chance Let's face facts: Spin-off TV shows tend to fare poorly to the original content. I was furious when I heard about the spin-off to the amazing Break Bad. Nonetheless centering around the buffoonish clown of a character Saul Goodman?! I was livid and heartbroken. I wanted Breaking bad to end on a high note and not let this potential disaster ruin it's legacy.

Breaking Bad was an absolute masterpiece of a show, with an amazing story, script, cinematography; you name it, it's there. But the one thing that made Breaking Bad shine, and in my option, be one of the greatest series ever made was it's deep, deep burial into the characters that made us either absolutely love or loath them. It didn't rely on special effects and had no fat to it whatsoever. No other show encapsulated a slow unfurling of characters so well that it was as if we were getting to know them in our real lives.

I finally decided to give Better Call Saul a shot after hating it's first episode on release. I figured, maybe I could eventually forget about the fact that it was attached to my favorite TV show, and when everybody who watches it is telling you it's amazing, there must be something there.. right?

Boy, were they right. Better Call Saul is just as good as it's predecessor. It maintains it's very high standard to every aspect of the production, and most of all, character development, motivation and relationships are centerfold once more. It is easy to find Better Call Saul even better than Breaking Bad, although I would chalk this up to it being more current and therefore more in the forefront of our minds in the Breaking Bad universe. If you, like me, have hesitated to give this show a shot for the same reasons, stop it. Let yourself feel uncomfortable for the 1st half of the first season, and then let it get it's clutches into you.

I'm so, so very happy I finally decided to give Better Call Saul a shot again 4 years later. With no hesitation, 10/10.",figurative
"Well Made but Terribly Difficult to Watch This is one of the most difficult reviews I've written. To start off I'd have to give credit where it is due. It was a very well produced series with excellent performances, but at the same time I was conflicted watching it. Even before they exposed the sick people who became fans of him in the later episodes I wondered why I was watching this to begin. There's something wrong with giving all of this fame and glory to this evil lunatic. Unlike many others I've read in the reviews I didn't feel sympathy for him for one second. There are many individuals in this world with sick fantasies and poor upbringings who don't go on to do what he did.

On the other hand I do think it is valuable to learn the history of these types of events as the show particularly did a good job highlighting the systemic flaws that allowed this flame to become a blazing forest fire. I did check the truth behind much of the series and it does do a good job in this respect as well.

Overall, of any series I've ever watched this is definitely one that I couldn't and would never watch again. I learned stuff I didn't know which was valuable , but I hate that these kinds of people live on infamy through productions like this.",literal
"Finnish him? No chance! Who doesn't enjoy seeing evil Nazi's beaten to a pulp, torn limb from limb, and generally getting what they deserve? (Answer: other Nazis). Director Jalmari Helander dedicates Sisu to the art of killing goose-stepping fascists, pitting the despicable jack-booted German's against Aatami (Jorma Tommila), a hard-as-nails Finnish commando who doesn't know the meaning of the word 'quit'. After Aatami strikes gold in the wilds of Finland, he makes his way back to civilisation to cash in his hoard, but crosses paths with a Nazi platoon - and we all know that Nazis like to steal gold!!

However, trying to take Aatami's treasure proves to be a big mistake: no matter what the German's do to him, he simply won't give up until he has gold back and every last Nazi is dead. The fact that the Finnish soldier is so indestructible takes some swallowing, until it becomes clear that his nickname - The Immortal - is to be taken at face value: this bloke has more lives than a cat. Once you wrap your head around the fact that Aatami simply does not die, the film becomes all the more fun, as the enemy come to realise that taking an immortal's hard-earned riches is an even dumber move than nicking a leprechaun's pot of gold.

In terms of style, the film is very Tarantino-esque, split into 6 chapters, each introduced with a big bold title; the violence is graphic, with lots of blood and guts. There's even a group of female Finnish POWs who lend Aatami a hand in killing the baddies - and there's nowt more Tarantino than a gang of women unloading machine guns into a truck of Nazis. The ending takes the craziness up to eleven as the nastiest Nazi, Bruno (Aksel Hennie), makes his escape on a plane, unaware the Aatami has hitched a ride. The action ends with a bang for both Bruno and Aatami, but only one of them is immortal...

One might argue that the plot is slight, and the film derivative in terms of execution, but if you're after a bit of mindlessly violent popcorn entertainment and found John Wick 4 needlessly overblown and overlong, this one should do the trick: it clocks in at a far more reasonable ninety-one minutes.",figurative
"FBI = Fatally Bad & Inexcusable The two lead actors are stiff and unbelievable, beginning with the pilot episode. The strong but conflicted woman and the agent of color who just happens to be Muslim have been done before, and done better, and Sela Ward, whom I normally like, pretty much just phoned in her performance. It is amazing that this series got any episodes green lit. A second season would be enhanced torture on the viewers.",literal
"Better than the original I wasn't intending to write a review for this show, even though I quite like it. It is NOT NCIS and should not be confused for it. This is a show about NIS, how Gibbs became ""Gibbs"" and a show about Mike Franks. And it is FAR better than NCIS and that's not to discredit either. Knowing that Gibbs had a wife and daughter, that wasn't mentioned until the later seasons means it is raw in the show's content. It has literally just happened, he has not dealt with his guilt, survived trying to kill himself and is trying to figure out who he is.

The show is raw, emotional, engaging and with each episode it gets better. I think we are up to the fifth at least and Mike Franks is by far the stand out character because he is REALLY interesting. Think about what you know about Gibb and his affect and imagine him as a young man who left his wife and child with a bad feeling that he would never see them again and then someone kills them.... And you can't get to them. Yet. He definitely finds ways to use it though and the episode with the little girl is heartbreaking.",literal
"Not your father's Robin Hood First of all, the show is not historically accurate. The Normans did not bring Christianity to England. It had been around for centuries before William the Conquerer decided to invade Britain. The Saxons didn't like Norman rule, of course, but it is ridiculous to portray them as heretics. The person playing Robin has zero charisma. The rest of the cast is pretty good. The scenery is nice, though. I doubt I watch the rest of the show.",literal
"Disappointing I'll start off my review with some of the things that makes this at least a watchable show. To preface, I have not seen season 2 nor do I plan on it, as I have only heard negative things about it. I figured if I didn't think season 1 was all that, then I may as well not bother with season 2 as even the biggest fans of this show say it's not good.

Pros: The animation is great. Fight scenes are super cool and very well put together, however being that it came out in 2016 that is somewhat expected nowadays. Leapfrogging off of that point, the character design is amazing too. All characters are extremely different in look and it's a masterpiece in design. Saitama's look is absolutely perfect given the nature of his deadpan, I'm bored with everything personality and it provides humor throughout the show. The last pro I'll give here is that there is humorous elements throughout, and it's a nice switch up compared to other shows that are all serious. However, it's not enough to where it stands out. For example, Demon Slayer has humorous elements, but you would never say it's a funny show. I think the same can be said here. The humor provides levity but I think it's somewhat exaggerated by others.

Cons: There's virtually no plot. Every episode is essentially a different monster and another battle. There is no backstory to anything and they just kind of show up to destroy the city. Eventually Saitama comes in and gives them his ""one punch"", then off to the next episode. Sure, there are some enemies that last a few episodes, but no more than that. Secondly, as a whole Saitama is a very weak main character. There's virtually no backstory to him outside of him saving a child and becoming a hero after that, and there is no mention as to how he's some sort of god. I suppose we just have to come up with our own conclusions as to how he got those powers? At one point Genos asks him his secret, to which he tells him to do 100 sit-ups and push-ups everyday. Sure it's an element of humor, but it just adds to the lack of depth he has as a character. Another problem I have with the show is that every fight with Saitama is predictable. You know he's going to win because he's the strongest man in the universe. This is something great shows always avoid, because it eliminates any sense of worry or urgency to his actions. In the last episode the ""ruler of the universe"" or whatever gives him a beating, but he comes off unscathed and kills him. It just makes the show boring as a whole and the whole idea of a ""one punch man"" is something a 4th grader would come up in during English class.

Overall, this show does not deserve an IMDB 8.8. I only felt the urge to write a review because of how overrated it is. It's enjoyable for about 4 episodes until you realize the show has little to know plot. New monster, new bad guys, new hero's, next episode. That mixed in with the fact that the main character is dry and too powerful for the show to be interesting has me not wanting to watch any more. I can see why people would enjoy it, but anyone who truly values a good plot line will be disappointed. Worth the watch? In my opinion it's a skip, but not a complete waste of time if you do give it a shot.",figurative
"Nothing special. The plot was basic. The acting was basic. The characters were basic. Even the stories trying to explain the 'horsemen' not being together...stupid. The only thing what was cool was 'the house' except rhey ruined that at the end sooooooo.... The execution was not good. Nothing new, interesting, or original. I liked the twist, kinda, but you also kinda saw it coming so not really. And I cannot for the life of me understand or appreciate the protagonists accent. Was it French? It almost sounded southern at times? It sounded inconsistent. The trailers made her seem like she was going to be formidable...she was BASIC.

I'm sorry, it sucked. I said it.",literal
"Really really bad - Not a rom com - weird romance drama I don't leave many reviews but this movie really disappoints. If you're expected a rom com, think again... movie is just icky. If you're expecting a straight romance narrative... also think again. Guess it's a straight drama? Honestly there are just some weird vibes. Not sure what it is, the acting, the writing or what but this should have never made it out of the studio. Not good for couples, not good for date night, just not good. Pedro does a good job, Evans tries hard and is one of the acting stars in this one but him opposite the protagonist with this writing/story is just a reach. Just kinda icky.",literal
"Season 2, Episode 7 This pitiful series did an immediate nose-dive at Season 2, Episode 7. What a bunch of narcissistic crap. It was a bit fun at the beginning of the series with reese Witherspoon but it just digs itself into a hole. Garbage.",literal
"Can't wait for its return! Good story lines without a lot of sugar-coating or fantasy. We meet characters with depth, from the token firehouse playboy to a lesbian portrayed primarily as a human (that's a TV first). Some good action/effects scenes. Eye candy for everyone. What more can you ask? I truly enjoyed this one. Watched the whole series over a 2 week period while I was sick. I'm waiting with anticipation for it to return.

Love David Eigenberg as Herrmann--so glad to see him back on TV in a series. Doesn't everyone know a guy like Herrmann? Joe Minoso does a great job as Cruz. All in all they're a very interesting and varied group of characters. I like them all.",literal

"Massive missed opportunity The premise sets up a one in a million criminal mastermind vs Marshals/CIA/law enforcement/citizens of Alaska. It teases brilliant writing, clever characters - good and bad, high suspense, great fighting scenes, believable - even if it's a bit extreme. All of which occurs in episode 1. Then episode two comes out, and we immediately realize they blew the budget and the writing on episode one, nothing left for the remainder of the season. Why? Why can't you follow through? Why has tv and movies fallen off so hard? Where is the great writing? Where is the intelligence? If AI can write better than this, then I'm all for it, because current writers are not working hard enough, or good writers aren't getting hired. If you're a writer, please explain why it's gotten so bad.",figurative
"I Love This Show Even though this is a chick series, tell the truth I really like it. Love it, maybe?. There is something different about this show. Something good that make it so unique, and I'm not talking about fast pace of conversation and loads of sarcasm between each character.

The story is good and not boring, somewhat very memorable and it going to make you feel very cozy watching it. Plus with good acting and gorgeous girls, this show is so great that I can't find any negativity. (a little bias, I know, but it is that good.) 

Anyway, when did you last see any show that have millions of fans and site especially for it, that how good the show is, and I highly recommend anyone and everyone to watch the show.

Rating: 9.9/10 (Grade: A+)",figurative
"🎉💎 🍸 Entertaining, but too much Stupidity Just Got Out Of a Screening Of Now You See Me Now You Don't.

😳A Couple walked out and others were checking phones at around the 1 hour 15 Mark.

It's Entertaining at Times Because of the Bright Lights, The Parties 🎉, The Music & The Magic Tricks.

"Good but could have been better A crime thriller in Alaska. The beginning scene on EP 1 draws you in. The pacing keeps you engaged. There's a lot to unpack with each character. The antagonist is an evil genius determined to reveal secrets about the CIA. The lead is a family man who's a US marshal in charge of protecting the town of Fairbanks and containing the threat.

I feel like I've seen this show before. The plot is not necessarily predictable but the concept has been done before. There's a lot of moving parts that make's this series interesting. I'm just not sure if this is dark enough to reach its full potential.

Edit: this has gone downhill. Each episode drifts further away from the original plot. Compared to the writing with other Apple TV series this is lack luster.

6/10.",literal
"Not Horror. More Mystery/Comedy Good movie, just not my type of ""horror"". I also think the hype of this movie gave me higher expectations because by the end, I thought this was an average movie. It was definitely written differently than other movies which gives it a cool new feel which is why I think people are going over the top with this rating. I would recommend people to watch this but wouldn't go out of your way to a theater for it. Wait until it's October and probably free on a streaming platform.",figurative
"Not laugh out loud funny, but still hilarious Yes, almost all characters are extremely unlikable, but I think that's the charm of The White Lotus. You can definitely still see each of their motivations and I feel like the writers were very self aware of the stereotypes they put in each main character. The comedy for me was on point, but it might be disappointing for people who prefer punchline jokes. The music was pretty awesome and it set a very specific tone to the series.

The story is pretty good, but my main criticism is that it makes you think that all the characters' side stories would come together at some point, but I just didn't think that happened in a satisfying way. The different groups only interact with each other on a few scenes, and with very few exception, the encounters barely make any difference to the plot. Besides, some side encounters make no sense, like the quick appearance of the pregnant lady from the first episode. I'm still trying to figure out what the hell she was there for.

All things considered, I highly recommend it to people who like satirical comedy. Great main characters and pretty good storyline.",literal
"Holy Smokes and Stacks 'Sinners' is a dark, stylish and genuinely fresh take on the vampire genre. Set in 1930s Mississippi, it blends the gothic with the spiritual - vampires, church, blues music, and the weight of the segregated South - into something bold and unforgettable.

Michael B. Jordan is magnetic playing twin brothers Smoke and Stack, each with their own vibe and purpose. Their chemistry anchors the film, but it's Hailee Steinfeld who steals scenes as Mary - a layered, quietly powerful performance that grounds the more surreal elements.

There's a dark humour running beneath it all, and the music is incredible - bluesy, moody, full of soul. It's a film that takes risks with tone and style, but it all comes together. Vicious, vibey, and unlike anything else in the genre.",literal
"Started great, got preachy. Hysterically raunchy and fun Seasons 1-5. After that the writers just kept creating improbable situations with even more improbable results. I mean these people rarely if ever land in jail? They should be put away for years given the things they do. Frank is the worst! His getting away with everything gets old real quick. He's obnoxious and disgusting and deserves to be locked up and throw away the key. It seems like the writers just like to keep writing to hold onto viewership with shocks and ridiculous twists that add up to NOTHING. Emily Rossum as Fiona is the best fully developed character. Jeremy Allen White as Lip is the same in THE BEAR as he is in this. Season 8 is super preachy and the creators add more political injustice plots on top of each other so after a few episodes, uh, you just don't care anymore. Should have ended at Season 7. Speaking of 7, I rated it this because the first 7 seasons were provocative, full of laughs, tons of wild sex, and every situation makes fun of EVERYONE. No minority is safe from this series.",literal
"First and second episode only review Episode 1. So, I just watched the first episode of the new IT series, and yes, I'll keep watching because I've always been a huge IT fan.

Honestly, I get that IT is all about imagination... it's meant to be something you experience through the eyes of children, where fantasy and fear blend together. That part I respect. But the way they used CGI and fake-looking sets... nope. It completely kills the vibe. It's overdone, unrealistic, and honestly kind of ridiculous at times.

As for the child actors, they're not terrible, but it feels like déjà vu. Like we've seen this exact lineup a hundred times before. Everything feels recycled and generic.

At this point, if we're going to rely that much on CGI, we might as well let AI make the whole movie and honestly, I think I'd prefer that over this cartoonish visual style.

Anyway, that's just my take after episode one. I'll keep watching and see how it evolves but let's just say, my expectations are officially on pause for now.

Episode 2 of IT: Honestly, it just confirms what I said in my review of the first one, the CGI completely kills the atmosphere. It feels like they're trying to make up for a flat storyline with visual effects, but it only makes everything look fake and lifeless. There's no tension, no real fear, nothing unsettling about it.

And again, it's all so déjà vu. The kids are OK actors but it's the same formula we've seen a thousand times: the bullied kid, the abusive parent, the depressed mom, the family trauma. It's like they're following the Stephen King cliché checklist, updated for 2025.

As for horror? None. Not a single scene feels scary or even suspenseful. Everything is so polished and predictable that you never actually feel on edge. It's starting to feel more like a sad drama about traumatized kids than a horror series.

Honestly, I'm just waiting for Bill Skarsgård to show up, because right now, even the plot feels painfully slow and uninspired. Nothing grabs you. If they don't start bringing real horror into it soon, this might just end up being another overproduced, CGI-filled flop.",figurative
"Disappointment I really wanted to like this one - Emma Thompson is consistently wonderful but even she can't make a story that should be riveting, well, just mediocre. I made it through the middle of the third episode and realized my mind was wandering as the story just plodded along, attempting every now and then to drop an interesting fact or clue, but quickly slogging back into its soporific state. In addition, many of the supporting players were weak, which was hindered by their need to deliver terrible dialog. And on top of it all, I couldn't figure out the point of the dual story telling tones - was this a spy story or a satire? Certainly something can be both, but this just didn't do it. Boring!!!",literal
"Has all the hallmarks of a quality quality show! Episode 10.. the videography and sequences of shots.. the sequence of events, the storeytelling was very very well delivered, was absolutely WOW factor! Took me to another place within watching the show. You know when your so tuned into whats taking place you forget to breathe. Those that havent watched it.. you guys are missing out on something brilliant! Great cast with talented talented acting. From the big names to the new names.. everyone has equal recognition. Lines delivered with style and drives the viewer to feel excited and pumped and cant wait to see whats next. The show felt big budgeted and well deserving. I felt like i was watching a movie, thats how great it was. May the show continue and all the good things to keep it coming. The SHOW MUST CARRY ON! Bravo! Absolute BADASS!",literal
"The Italian series is better I watched the Italian series before and just started with the 2 first episodes of the US version. It's definitely okay, but I prefer the Italian version. The Italian version was with a very charismatic man with a great smile that misses this version.

I think it's a shame to make a remake of a great series. Probably it's because the original was in Italian, maybe better synchronise it.",literal
"Zach Creggar is becoming a favorite Weapons is a masterclass in modern horror filmmaking. It may not aim to scare in the traditional sense, but it excels in ways that matter far more: cinematography, writing, directing, and narrative structure. Zach Cregger has crafted one of the most visually stunning and narratively intricate horror films of recent years. What makes Weapons exceptional is its anthology-like structure. The way it transitions between characters and storylines feels seamless, almost effortless, yet the precision behind it is clear. On first viewing, I was immediately hooked, and with each subsequent watch, the film revealed layers of continuity and clever detail that only enhanced my appreciation. Pacing is deliberate, and while some may find it slow at first, it is methodical rather than dragging. Each beat and character arc is carefully constructed, creating a slow burn tension that rewards attentive viewers. Unlike most horror films that lose their impact after a single watch, Weapons continues to reveal new nuances, making rewatching a joy. This is a near perfect execution of a complex narrative in the horror genre. It demonstrates a level of craft and ambition that elevates it above most contemporaries. After multiple viewings, it earns an 8.6/10, and Zach Cregger solidifies himself as a director to watch. For me, Weapons is already shaping up to be one of the standout films of 2025.",literal
"Mafia in cowboy hats This show is nothing more than ""The Godfather"" set in Montana. A family doing shady business deals, murders, revenge,corrupt police and politicians in their back pocket, the son who ""comes home from war"" to take over the family business...it's all there. Except that when there were hits against the Corleone family, someone died. No one in the Dutton family or their organization dies, only their enemies. This has as much to do with real ranching as ""Hogan's Heroes"" had to do with WW2.",figurative
"Waste of time Wish I didn't have to come up with three hundred plus words for this review since it could easily been captured in one little word - that being awful. It was so very slow and monotonous. It was a waste of a good cast, especially Idris Elba, who was the only light in this very dark tunnel. When the credits came I I checked to see how much time was left because I KNEW that really couldn't be the end. WRONG. I want two hours of my time back.",literal
"Merry Christmas to All... I have been eagerly anticipating the opening of this film for several months.  Being a huge Jim Carrey fan, I easily saw how he could morph himself into Seuss' Grinch and make the character his own.  I was not disappointed.  

This movie was pure magic.  Carrey is a master at his trade and no one could have played this role to perfection as he did.  There was plenty to enjoy for both adults and children alike and this movie is sure to become a timeless classic for all to enjoy in the years to come.  I already have visions of my young daughter sitting down year after year to watch this remake on video, and I undoubtedly will watch with her and laugh as I did the first time I saw it.

Clearly, this movie has Jim Carrey written all over it, and I do not believe that it would have come together without him.  However, the supporting cast was charming and entertaining in their own right, most notably the adorable Taylor Momsen who was the perfect foil for Carrey's antics.  The set design, musical score and costumes all lent their hands to a magical, fabulous finished product and I believe all involved can be proud. 

 It is not an easy feat to turn a 22 minute cartoon classic into a full length live action film, but Howard has succeeded with flying colours.  For those critics who disagree, perhaps it is your hearts that are 2 sizes too small.",literal
"Wastes of lot of time on unnecessary/repetitive dialogue. Most of the humor falls sooooo flat! There were some things I liked about the movie, but I will just make mention of a couple things that sucked!  Alright! We get it! Eddie is a hypochondriac! I don't understand why the movie dedicates 1/4 of it's total run time on dialogue and scenes related to Eddie being a hypochondriac.So, we already get a full dose of it while we're at Eddie's house. Now it cuts to them talking before coming up to the sewer/tunnel and the conversation is something along the lines of Eddie thinking every plant is poison ivy. The hypochondriac talk continues the entire time while they stand in the entrance and while some of the kids proceed a little ways into the tunnel (several minutes). I can't believe that they didn't catch this in the cutting room floor. Not only did they not catch it, the very next scene after they leave the tunnel cuts to them ridding their bikes and they have the balls to dub in more dialogue of Eddie being a hypocondriac. AT this point it's already soooo insanely old, but that's only the tip of the iceburgh.  What were they thinking? Did they think this was humorous? Is performing a rendition of the same joke several dozen times funny? 

Which takes me to how unfunny this director must be. The movie utilizes Richie for most of the movies so called jokes. Early on Richie has a couple chuckle worthy one liners, but after that the jokes fall so insanely flat... they bomb so hard that they're cringe worthy. It's so bad that you would think that this movie was directed by a foreigner. If you're not familiar, humor almost always does not convert well when people learn a new language, then write jokes in that language regardless of how well they know that 2nd language. That's how most of the humor plays out in this movie.",literal
"Typical Just another over dramatized crime thriller where they all have the same look of despair on their faces through out the entirety of the show. Every little thing is awkwardly forced into some deep meaningful moment. It's hard to comprehend why viewers would believe veteran FBI agents act like irrational, immature teenagers.",literal
"80s Teen Surrealism The teen movie genre of the 1980s had as its central premise 'finding a partner'. So this movie is no exception but where it differs is its bizarre way of hammering home the obvious messages this film contains.

 The plot for those who aren't aware concerns two 'nerds' who decide to create a woman using their computer(!).  As a young teen myself watching this for the first time I never really considered how totally out there this John Hughes film is.  Apart from the idea of creating a perfect woman who does everything you want (a horrendously sexist idea that is hardly redeemed by the weak moralising at the end), we have snow falling in someones' bedroom, a kitchen turned blue, nuclear warheads sprouting through a bedroom floor and furniture flying through chimneys.  The one part of this film that really strikes me as odd is where did Kelly Le Brock (who plays Lisa the created woman) get her powers to make all this weird stuff happen?

I was pretty disappointed when I revisited this.  Nostalgia had created this movie as a minor classic in my rose tinted eyes. In reality all I found was a plot full of holes, an unpleasant teen fantasy and a director who looked like he couldn't give a damn about any more 'nerdy teens come good'.",literal
"Great character interaction. It appears that quite a few raters and reviewers take serious issue with Claire Danes character in this mini series. I understand it. During the first half of the first episode I couldn't help but notice that she was playing almost the same personality as her tortured agent in Homeland. But I pressed on and started to really enjoy the tense and blunt interactions between her character and the slick sociopath/psychopath played so well by Matthew Rhys. I really loved the locations as well.

I have only watched the first episode but by the end I wanted to keep watching into the early hours. I just wanted to leave a quick review because there are so many very poor reviews and some very praising reviews. The praising ones aren't fake. I personally look forward to the rest of this show. Try it. You will know by the end of the first episode if it's for you.",literal
"AAAAHHHH IT'S SO GOOOD I don't usually write reviews, but this is legitimately one of the best movies I've seen this year. I just finished it and I already want to rewatch it! This was made for my target audience, and boy did they DELIVER. The songs in this movie are amazing, however if you are not musical person, you will hate this movie lowk. The characters, the CHARACTERS, YES. Whoever designed the boy band and wrote their songs and choreography needs a million raises. To be truthful, I came for the hot boy band and good songs, and the movie delivered AND exceeded expectations. The main girls were a fun trio, and I loved watching their character dynamic. I cannot complain.",literal
"Enjoying it so far A fresh take on an old tale. You can see time has gone into production and the acting is good quality. There are many similarities between this and GoT.

Hope that this becomes a longer term show so we can see many of the exploits of one of the best folk heroes in history.

Ignore the bible belter reviews, and give it a go.",literal
"Love it First of all, can I please point out something I haven't seen anyone else point out - does anyone feel like Diane Wiest took the roll so she could say ""Michael"" over and over again like in Lost Boys? She's the only one who calls Renner's character ""Michael"" instead of ""Mike."" Anyway, it just reminds me of that super cut they made on YouTube of every time in the Lost Boys someone says ""Michael.""

I think this show is great. I love Jeremy Renner in anything, and the rest of the cast is great. Instead of calling it a mix of The Shield and Prison Break, I would say it's more of a mix of The Wire and Oz.

I could do without the Iris character. Her decisions don't make any sense and there's no chemistry between herself and Michael. Also, her accent is out of place - probably because she's British trying to do an American accent which is most closely related to southern accents.

I really love the relationship between Bunny and Michael.

If you enjoy The Wire, you'll like this. If you don't enjoy The Wire, I'm not sure what's wrong with you.",literal
"if i see one more close-up.... I had high hopes, given the buzz, and the cast. But.... OMG, i have rarely sat through such ludicrous over the top directing and performances, and if i was not with friends, I would have walked out. The characters are impersonal and there is ZERO chemistry between the leads. She is narcissistic and unreasonable (""you must go to London!"" ""why were you in London?!?!"") he is spineless and a bit weird. There's sections that serve no function (the falcon...why?!), and the director tries SO HARD to make you cry it's literally ridiculous. Terrible terrible terrible. The DP is the only saving grace, but I didn't go to the theater to look at tableaus. The emperor has no clothes.",literal
"Bedtime Detectives ""NCIS"" has been a champion on CBS for so many years now. It's a tried and true formula that, despite it's repetitiveness, it satisfies as a mid-evening, comfy procedural. Though the cast has changed many times, it recycles stories, though doesn't feel like a replay. To be fair, there's only so many things that can happen, but what helps immensely is the cast. Throughout the seasons, even though there's much turnover, the NCIS team is a family, a work family, and the kind you'd like to spend time with and get to know. The dramatic nature of a serious procedural can use a spruce of humor, here and there, and that certainly makes it easier to digest. Over the years, the amount of episodes that were a little more violent or gross in some minor way have been few and far between. This isn't ""SVU"". It's a show that seems almost quaint. You sense the characters love each other. There's playful jabs, and puns. It's definitely a safer show than similar fare. A lot of people think of this show as a show for old guys. I can see why they'd say that. CBS certainly leans that way, demographic wise, but it's easygoing for the most part, and a good way to wrap up a night.",literal
"I really wanted to love this It honestly hurts to say, but I found this movie to be quite boring. The actors all do a good job, especially David Johnson and Cooper Hoffman, but the characters were written pretty flat. They each get assigned a pretty standard stereotype and no one really changes much throughout the walk. Yes we get to know more about some of their backstories, but that's about it. However I certainly liked the friendships between the musketeers and they were sweet but also tragic to watch knowing they'll have to die.

Unfortunately I've found the film to be repetitive, as well. They walk and bond --> someone gets hurt --> they all encourage him to keep walking --> he gets shot. Over and over again.

Maybe it's just me, but I also didn't really understand what the whole point of the long walk is? How would something like this inspire the American people to get off their feet and rebuild their nation?

I do think that this is the best you can do with this material. I would have hoped for more striking visuals which bring out the apparent dystopia. We never see much of that in the scenery except for a dead animal and a burning car. Maybe I'll like it more when I rewatch it because I do think that the premise is really fascinating.

Maybe I'll like it more when I rewatch it sometime, I really hope I will.",figurative
"Nothing Special A moderately entertaining follow-up to the first one. Not as good though: the fights are good but none touch the greatness of the bus fight. Its a little more funny then the first probably a smart choice given how pro murder it is. Odinkirk is fun as ever, and Sharon Stone is amusingly over the top as the villain. It's a little thin but fine.",literal
"Let it rest. Grey's Anatomy... this show has probably been on everyone's ""to watch"" list at some point. While watching, I can honestly say it was a good show full of emotions, comedy, great characters, and even engaging plot twists and cliffhangers. But, the later seasons, mainly seasons 14 through 19, were hard to watch. I did enjoy it, but it wasn't the same excitement I had when I first started the show; I think once the OG cast left, everything felt off and more like characters were replacing the ones that left.

Overall, it's a good show, but don't feel obligated to finish every season. I've watched what I needed to, the fan favourites, and I probably won't watch anything after season 19.",literal

"Let down with poor repetitive acting This movie had a few highlights but was an overall let down by poor unbelievable acting from Camille Sullivan. The movie did have one solid moment for about 20 mins when Mia reaches the abandoned house. But other than that, the ending was anti-climatic and predictable and the setup and opening 30 mins are cringe-worthy. How many times are you going to get the actor to turn their head slowly to look behind them? So silly and overplayed. Nothing original here. Only worth it for the younger generation who may not have seen movies of this type ever before.",literal
"The Marvel experience we've come to know and love has returned The first ten years of Marvel were iconic in movie history, but why? Because it was clear it was all made with true love for movies and fiction. A passion for characters that feel real, despite how fantastical or weird or goofy they actually are. The fact that you could visit the cinema and hear the people around you, laugh, sniffle, cry and chuckle around you. That was the Marvel experience for me.. not the fact they copied existing comic book stories to a different format, but the comics were an inspiration for the movie makers. Even fans couldn't predict the outcome of Infinity War. And all that, that's the experience I had with this movie, for me the Marvel experience I came to know and love..",literal
"So, so funny Four episodes in and I wait with bated breath each week for the next one.

This has a mix of really funny comedy and the hint of romance and just feels right.

Very well done and Glen Powell does it so well.

This does contain a bit of American football, but not enough to put off those that are not fans.",literal
"Pick an episode, any episode. They're all the same. The premise: she's a career foreign service officer who gets an ambassadorship. Her husband is a former ambassador who is a loose cannon who makes life and work difficult for her. Whatever the situation, that's the story. In every episode the embassy staff has to deal with the couple's problems. So do intelligence officers, state department ministers, etc. Perhaps the story line will move forward. So far, the only thing that's moved forward is the severity of the combat between the ambassador and her husband. There are some laughs, but it starts getting tedious quickly. I don't know yet whether I have patience to find out.",literal
"I should have loved this on paper - beautiful production, but a weak theme and misaligned casting. I love AHS, Scream Queens, and most things on Ryan Murphy's list, so I really should have loved this. Instead, I feel a bit meh so far.

Pros 
* The show looks stunning - beautiful cinematography, flawless styling, and a great set.



* The writing is tight with good comedic timing, even though it's not laugh-out-loud funny (nor is it meant to be).



* Sarah Paulson is fantastic, as always. She's the only reason I didn't switch off before the end of Episode 1.


Cons 1. Weak theme I'm a woman in my mid-30s, and I struggled to connect with the premise. The audience for this feels very narrow - it leans toward a ""middle-aged-women-vs-men"" dynamic that feels cliché and one-dimensional. The storyline often feels biased, with anything that doesn't fit the narrative brushed aside. It ends up feeling more toxic than empowering.

2. Casting issues I found myself zoning out whenever Sarah Paulson or Niecy Nash weren't on screen. Even with a stronger cast, the underlying theme would still be a problem, but better casting could elevate things at least slightly. Regarding Kim K - I think she's ok for someone that didn't grow up in acting school - but not every producer needs to be on-screen.

Overall The concept of an all-women law firm focused solely on divorce is extremely narrow, and it ends up being one of the show's biggest weaknesses. The theme doesn't have enough depth to sustain the story.

Based on how things are going, I'll finish Season 1 to see where it lands, but I'm unlikely to continue beyond that unless the direction changes significantly.",literal
"Jackie Brown meets Hunt for Red October This film is tense. It's split into three, but by the end of the first third, I needed a break to breathe. It's about details a lot as the same story is retold three times. You have to suspend a little bit of disbelief to allow the story to unfold. As a viewer, you're elicited to join in the reaction to ""what do you mean you don't know"". The build up attempts to carry mini stories a bit like crash (the 2004 film), but I found these distracting to the point where big moments needed to be filtered out. Everything is building up to a decision which needs to be made. But it's the last third where I felt the tension let up and eased off. I wouldn't recommend this film, especially right now politically where the implications are obvious. But it's one to go out and watch and then discuss over cocktails with someone bright and switched on. I've been careful in this review to give nothing away, but it's inherent in my rating.",literal
"A Christmas cracker with genuinely funny jokes. If you're stuck for gift ideas for that special someone this Christmas, why not give them the gift of laughter with the Chevy Chase comedy classic 'National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation? Heartwarming and hilarious, this festive favourite will guarantee a very merry time.

Chase plays Clark Griswold, a well intentioned family man whose plans for the perfect Christmas go disastrously wrong: the thousands of lights that adorn his home refuse to work; his in-laws argue with his parents; the Christmas tree goes up in flames; he is trapped in the attic while hiding his gifts; a sledging incident almost costs him his life; the turkey is overdone; his embarrassing hick relatives turn up expectedly for the holidays; a wild squirrel invades the home; and worst of all, his bonus cheque seems to have gone missing in the post.

Naturally, by the time Christmas Day arrives, Clark is a complete nervous wreck, and when he discovers that his Christmas bonus is a 'year's membership to a jelly club', rather than the expected cash bonus, his temper finally snaps (of course, this being a good natured Christmas tale, everything turns out right in the end, thanks to the intervention of dumb, but well-meaning Cousin Eddie).

Written by 80s comedy genius John Hughes, Christmas Vacation's script is bristling with very funny lines of dialogue, but it is the visual gags that get the biggest laughs: Clark somehow driving the family saloon between the wheels of a huge truck; the bushy tailed rodent clinging to Clark's back; the sight of Clark careering across a freeway on a well oiled sled. Chase gives one of his most memorable performances, making Clark a thoroughly likable character that one can't help but admire, despite his failures, and he is given able support by a superb cast that includes Beverly D'Angelo as his long suffering wife Ellen, Randy Quaid as Cousin Eddie, and Juliette Lewis as his daughter Audrey.

And the best thing about the film? You can watch it time after time and it'll always put a smile on your face; it really is the gift that keeps on giving.",literal
"Loved It I absolutely loved Animal Kingdom as it has quickly become one of my all-time favorite shows! It's not only one of the best shows currently on tv but it's also just flat out one of the best shows ever created! I'm just so impressed with how each season continues to be just as good as the others! If you haven't seen this incredible show yet and are looking for a show that will keep you on the edge of your seat every episode then stop what you're doing right now, do yourself a favor and go watch it...I promise you that you won't be disappointed! If you don't believe me all you have to do is look at the ratings or read through the reviews to see how loved this show really is.",literal
"I don't know what to think.. I appreciate acting, cinematography, music, settings, locations, lighting...the works, in films. But I just can't seem to love this. If they had stayed with that haunted looking house as the main setting, then I would have really liked it. But let me list all the random places in this film: school, a few different homes of the kids, a library, a cellar, a haunted house, the sewers, the woods, the waterhole, the town, the garage, the pharmacy...I'll stop there. It was just small glimpses of every place to try and shed light on every single thing, it was almost like it wasn't a straight story to follow. Alas, some of them were great. Some scenes dragged, some scenes weren't enough. The clown itself was great: scary, good voice and acting. But it kept shape shifting into weird things haha. The kids were good, but not as amazing as people are saying in reviews. It was well filmed too. There was one scene in the movie that just turned me off and lost my interest..and that was the 'cleaning the bathroom'. I thought, okay..so they just happen to have all these cleaning supplies and extra gloves and they are gonna clean it top to bottom? Shouldn't it just disappear?! Anyways. Watch it yourself and see how you go. I'm not sad I paid to see it. Just wanted it a little more basic and not so exaggerated.",literal
"It's time to pull the plug! At first, I was thrilled to have watched Law & Order with its sharp, sophisticated writing and its New York City backdrop. But it's been 18 years since its preview, I think now is the time to end the show. I can see stories repeating themselves with a different cast and a different circumstance.

Law & Order like other shows have the run its course at least 8 years ago. I am grateful that they hire some of New York City's actors and actresses along with its cast and crew. But sadly, the show's legacy is that it's been on too long. The first years were great because it was new and fresh and now we are saying goodbye to beloved cast mates. I remember fondly seeing Jerry Orbach and Benjamin Bratt on the East 35th Street in New York City in October 1997. They were warm, friendly and gracious to us onlookers. They posed for the camera and smiled at us while they were doing their job.

It's one of my favorite memories of working in New York City was seeing them even though I was fired from my job that week. Law & Order is focused on the investigation and the trial but the show does it only in 40 minutes. It's not enough time for an actual investigation.",literal
"Declining series Just finished binge watching Season 14 and I have watched this show since the beginning. Maybe the producers or whomever are trying to set a record for the length of the series, but there is little other reason for this show to continue. The exit of vital characters like Ziva & DiNozzo has created a downward slide into mis-casting key roles and creating dubious plots. The one bright spot in casting is Reeves, the MI6 transplant - both the actor and the character bring a breath of fresh air to the otherwise dowdy team. The loss of Vance's wife and Ziva's father was a preposterous plot twist. The addition of Quinn and Torres to fill the gaps in the NCIS team is weak and failing. Quinn has nothing to do and Torres doesn't belong there. Neither character is interesting nor entertaining in any way. Maybe, like Reeves, the producers should have considered another foreign import, French or Swedish?, to add some dimension. Bishop is marginally effective as an analyst, but is not believable as a field agent. It would have been better to keep her married and have her be the nerdy info bank who gathers and sorts backgrounds & personality profiles, even if it were a smaller role. That kind of role would be a fair replacement for the departing Abby, and Bishop's tricky relationship with her NSA lawyer-husband would have brought new fodder to episodes. And why do we have to be subjected to Jimmy Palmer's buffoonery in every episode, said buffoon scenes becoming longer with each passing season? I'm also now very tired of Franks showing up in a delusion to drive a story. Kind of pathetic. There is lots more I could say but basically it's time for this series to go out with some dignity left. I know the show has been slated for a 16th season but I can't imagine it getting any better if it stays on the same path.",figurative
SORRY BUT HUDSON WAS GOOD Donot agree with those who proclaim Rock Hudson a bad actor in this movie. i thought he did a fine job and was very believable....Jane Wyman on the other hand i never really liked. In all her movies she looks old and that hair style seems to follow her in many films. THE PAIRING of jane and rock makes MAGNIFICENT less interesting and credible. And the movie moved along to fast and lacked pizzaz....THE little girl was fun and OTTO KRUGER played his role very well....I dont want to be too harsh on MISS WYMAN.....but i adored her only in one movie...JOHNNY BELINDA.....but anyways the film cannot be worse than the soaps that are on now a days.,literal
"Forgotten History An engaging retelling of the Garfield/Arthur presidency. Little is taught about this and I found this limited series to be a decent retelling of the events that lead to Garfield's election and assassination. Bless Crete for her strength and her final curse upon Guiteau. He has been forgotten to time. It is not he who is hailed a hero, but Garfield and Arthur for the progress they made.",literal
"Absolute page turner Oh boy another version of the Menendez story...so I thought. From the get go you're in, they reel you in and you're alllll the way in. Brilliant writing, music, acting, everything...this production knows how to make a series. I only write reviews for excellent productions just to make sure they know how much I appreciate their hard work because it's not easy to hit home runs in Hollywood but this one is without a doubt A+ work. Congratulations!!! The gentleman who played Lyle should win an award...perfection. You get both sides of the story, all angles, all views and it makes you think. It's a dark world and those boys took action. How to punish them takes some thought.",literal
"Worth a watch I know this is based on a book somewhere and I can't remember who wrote it. However, it is a good film for anybody who wants to look beyond the obvious. Without giving away the plot; a rich man causes a lady to lose her eyesight and then makes up for it in an interesting way (that's about as careful as I can be). Look out for the phrase ""I've already used it all up""  (or something like that) - it's more meaningful than you might think. This gets an eight out of ten from me!",literal
"May as well have been a generic disney adventure film Whose idea was it to turn Predator into a beat-for-beat Disney-style adventure film? This is Predator in name only. There is virtually none of the horror, tension, or atmosphere from the original. It feels like a cardboard cutout, generic kids movie. It may as well have been a Disney Channel original.

I could not believe they included every stereotype: the quirky, annoying sidekick who asks endless questions while traveling, the cutesy creature the audience is supposed to adore, the forced found-family dynamic, and the overtly evil villains with shallow motivations. It's seriously reminded me of like this straight to dvd kids movies my parents bought for me when I was a kid. Unbelievable.",literal
"More like keeping it close is it's best needed Keeper is one of those movies where it has a good concept, atmosphere and moments, but the underdeveloped characters and the poor writing fails to impress itself and makes a dreading slow experience.

Osgood Perkins has proven to be a great director. His works on Longlegs, The Blackout's Daughter, and Gretel & Hansel are slow-burn yet unique takes on horror storytelling that I have liked. Throughout, Perkins does try to establish some interesting directing choices within the setting and tone. There are some good camerawork and colorful presentation that helps display the creepy atmosphere and vibes. Tatiana Maslany performance was very good as her performances offers some genuine scares and emotions.

Unfortunately, Perkins can't save it because the story itself, feels lacking. Many writing and developments feel predictable, and filled with horror tropes. Alongside with the dialogue being silly, the characters are poorly developed. The main two lead stars lack chemistry and it made it very difficult to believe a single word from any of them. Which makes the pacing, structure and emotional engagement and scares feel thin and boring. However, Perkins' isn't writing this movie as he usually doe, so I can't blame him for the movie being poorly done, it's mainly the writing that drags it.

At it's core, a disappointment. But I still look forward to see what Osgood does next.",literal
"Just a guy who has seen the whole thing Just watch the first 5 seasons that actually has a beginning, middle and end. Those are the seasons that really worth watching. And then pretend like the rest doesn't exist because each season after season 5 is worse than the previous one (especially season 12) And that finale... Oh GOD!!! It's just doesn't worth it.",literal
"A disturning attempt to romanticize women s self-sacrificce This movie was incredibly frustrating to watch. It tries to normalize and even idealize a situation that is actually deeply unfair, unhealthy, and damaging. We follow a woman who gives up her dreams, ambitions, and entire career for her family, while her husband focuses solely on his own success. Then classicaly he goes on to have a affair with a woman many years younger.

Instead of showing the injustice of this dynamic, the film portrays her endless self-sacrifice as something noble-as if her suffering is beautiful and moral. She remains loyal, untouched, and supportive and of course always available as soon as he remembers her. The movie completely ignores her emotional reality and presents this toxic arrangement as if it were love or destiny.

It was painful to watch a story where a woman's needs, dignity, and boundaries are erased, and the narrative rewards the very behaviour that hurts her. Instead of challenging harmful patterns, the film celebrates them. For me, this wasn't romantic or inspiring-it was disturbing, regressive, and disappointing.

At the end of the movie she abandons her needs again and instead of pursuing her dream job, since her kids dont need her anymore, she falls for a ""romantic"" bate that her almost ex husband threw her that he will follow her and abandon his career and she rushes to tell him that she changed her mind and she will continue being a housewife..... Another movie that normalises women s self sacrifice ...such a prototype!",literal
"Tale of a bygone presidential assassination I know what you've been thinking ever since ""Parks and Recreation"" went off of the air: When will our beloved Ron Swanson (a.k.a. Nick Offerman) finally get to sink his teeth into the meaty dramatic role of Chester Arthur? Well, when the great actor Michael Shannon finally gets to portray the slain 19th century POTUS, James A. Garfield (and the great actress, Betty Gilpin, to play his wife), that's when! Duh, obviously. And this four-part limited mini-series fits this biographical bill just perfectly. It's highly recommended!",figurative
"A great exercise on style capped by truly wonderful return to from JLaw. In your face depiction of a woman is on the verge of a breakdown, a recently pregnant woman just does not want to be in this cloistered world in rural America, alone with her daughter and a sexless marriage - she crumbles as she tries to make sense of her situation. She unravels in her own little prison in rural America where everyone wants to understand her but in return, she runs away to her own.

It really hark the great feminist film about depression and the 'societal' pressure of motherhood and all. It a story as old as time from Mrs Beudet, to film's own Grace.

This is what I expect film like mother! Or Nightbitch would do. I guess it really helped that JLaw was not pigeonholed into this selfless victim narrative or unlike both, the 'surrealism' is handled with a more natural flair. She is an active participant of the exercise and she victimizes herself because she adheres to that social contract. She wants to escape it but she feels indebted. She is in the system she hates. You can see a woman wrote this, because in the end - she is that bird in the large cage meme. The women is in theory free, but she is making the mistake 'society' expects her to make.

She has all this options and easy outs, but she and her husband (who played well by RPatz ) was in this toxic cycle of trying to make things work but neither is willing to do their own half.

Another section I really loved about the film is is the visuals - best of the year in fact. I think the only Ramsey film I had watched had been the Kevin film and this could not been further from that. The quirky choice to just shade morning scenes into night scenes, the visualization of her depression and just the choices it does in more intimate moments (the repeated framing of the depth of the homespace, the overall muted/cooler tones, Pastel and Deep Green MidWest vibes). Everything about this is beauty defined.

As noted, I really love how the film does goes for artsier and 'transcendental' filmmaking techniques to show the rather confused state of Grace. It really makes it more palatable for me. I personally prefer that over the 'spelled' approaches of already mentioned films above. It captures the insanity in a way that does not breech corniness and pseudo-hifalutin-ness.

Then JLaw. Bravo for her. She really made this film. I love how she refuses to make her likable and makes her real rough any chance she got. She really relishes the character's standoffishness to full effect. Every piqued choices is smart and delivers a definition to a very elusive character. The film never really defines her except as a mother ( who is formerly a writer) in the end. She never gets a backstory or her hidden stories are never truly revealed. Also, loved Sissy Spacek in her support role. She colors the character so well. This is a character she had played in some way but she still is able to keep it so interesting. Meh on RPatz. He is the weak point of the film. He dozes far too conveniently at times.

I do have reservation on the overall structure of the film. I was mustering why I did not really give a masterpiece it even though I have so much love for the craft of it all. I get that she is depressed and she wants something more but it clicks by minute one. It lack that certain that like clockwork complication. There is gears but its a basic ass clock. You know the story the minute it started but I really still liked it.

Highly recommended. I wonder how was this re-edited I heard the original Cannes got so muted responses , so they pushed to edit this up.",figurative
"Great Show but Wiest's Character is Several people kept telling me to watch this show. I watched the first season as the second was coming out. As I started watching, it was not what I expected. This is a dark show and old Hawkeye shows he can play a deep dark anti hero. The only thing I can not tolerate is Wiest's character. According to her, the character, every thing is the fault of white males in society. So far to the left I am surprised she can stay on center camera. Every time her mouth opens I push the fast forward button until it shuts. If it was not for her ""character"" I would have given it a 9.5 on the rating. This is one of the better shows on right now and I am ready to watch season two.",figurative
"Now if only we could have an Afghan Disney Princess.. As far as animation goes, Moana is a tremendous achievement.

As far as the Disney mass-hysteria goes, Moana breaks a few trends.

As far as anything else goes -- you know, things that make a *movie*, Moana is an average motion-picture regurgitated from clichés too numerous to list and too hastily mashed together to have any kind of coherent effect.


* A princess wants to do things differently. (Opportunity for getting a bunch of adventurous-sounding rhymes stuck in teenage girls' head: Check. Now we have 2016's ""Let it Go"".)



* An authority figure wants her to stick to old ways.



* Another -- warmer -- authority figure believes in the princess.


-Magic.


* The princess is thrust into situations she is definitely not prepared for. But well, her grandma *believes* in her.



* Meets a jock.



* Gets constantly in trouble and needs to be helped by the jock or (literally) by forces of nature.



* Moments of self-doubt.



* The princess' moment of self-doubt is resolved by a vision of her dead-grandma.



* The jock's moment of self-doubt is resolved by the princess.



* Bunch of evil things.



* Everything fails.



* The princess saves the day with a song.


It's very rare that I end up sounding so cynical about a movie. I liked Zootopia. I'm okay with reusing certain plot techniques in a way that makes sense. But Moana focuses too much on character design, Polynesian ""authenticity"" and the must-break-the-glass-ceiling bandwagon that it kind of forgets that a movie is not only made by marketing and press, but also by its own innate qualities.",literal

"Incredible! We happen to live down the street from Garfield's house in Ohio and go there often to the park and to visit the house for various functions. President Garfield's grandchildren still live here in the area and are very active in preserving his legacy. Having said that, I thought this film was so impressive , so well acted and so historically accurate. How sad that he has been so forgotten.

He was an interesting man who knew many languages and could write with either hand and the stories about him could have made an even longer series.

I was not sure if this was going to be good or not and so was happily surprised at how excellent this production turned out to be. I was glued to this from the first episode. Excellent storytelling and excellent acting..",literal
"Random Comedy At It's Absolute Finest In the current climate, randomness = funny is very hard to achieve; but Smiling Friends manages to find that perfect balance everytime.

Despite each episode only clocking in a mere 10 minutes each, they pack so much charm and character into this universe of characters.

Zach Hadel and Michael Cussack are excellent and bounce off of each other like the best comedy duo's that have come and gone. Their characters - Charlie and Pim - inhabit a world populated by... Well, everything. There's no boundaries to who, what or where the world will have.

Rotoscoping, Stop-motion, PNG, 3D, 2D etc etc. Each animation style is used to great effect, blending together remarkably well as most of the time these styles do not mix at all; but like the comedy aspect, Zach and Michael have found that adult swim edge and added their own unique spin on it all.

As for the randomness? It's quite possibly some of the dumbest, most asinine content ever. And I love it. One episode in particular (mild spoilers) see's the two of them escorting a Lord of The Rings homage character to meet a princess whose been unable to smile, while trying to give her a gift. When they get to the castle at last - after this LoTR Character has been killed - it's revealed he was actually the princess' stalker and he's been trying to gift her a bomb this entire time.

There is no sense of cohesion or structure. Smiling Friends is what happens when you let your directors and animators off the reins and let them experiment far beyond what you'd expect.

I cannot wait for Series 2. Let the randomness continue.",literal
"Nuremberg - History that should not be forgotten 10/10 Just come out from watching Nuremberg. This was truly an incredible WWII thriller with especially outstanding performances from Remi Malek and Russell crowe as Herman Goring the former Reichsmarchall and to note Leo Woodall was also very intense as the German translator for the prisoners.

Their is definitely a cat and mouse game played out throughout the movie between Malek and Crowe which which culminates in a certain scene which is explosive.

This films does a very good job at creating a relationship between the two main leads. It shows Goring as a powerful figurehead to a desperate man seeking justification for his actions.

There are also certain parts of the film which are extremely emotive involving footage of the holocaust which really showcases the evil atrocities committed.

Other prominent Nazi officials are also showcased such as Rudolf Hess and the evil Julius Streicher, all actors involved really are top notch in potraying these monsters of history.

Although there may be some reviews downplaying due to some historical inaccuracies is one of the best movies I have seen in 2025 and would definitely recommend everyone to watch this for the sake of this part of important to never be forgotten. 10/10.",literal
"A Fresh Take on the Life Swap Genre Good Fortune boasts impeccable casting, a hysterical script, and more heart than most films dare to offer. Its sharp wit and understated dialogue shine throughout, delivering moments of genuine introspection without ever feeling heavy-handed.

In an era saturated with existentialist films, Good Fortune distinguishes itself by refusing to take life-or itself-too seriously. It invites viewers to step back, laugh in the face of adversity, and find levity in the chaos.

At first glance, the characters may appear two-dimensional or overly familiar. But as the story unfolds, it becomes clear how meticulously Aziz crafted each one. They're fresh yet layered, revealing unexpected depth and nuance as the film progresses. His thoughtful storytelling-something I've long admired-elevates the narrative and spares it from becoming just another formulaic life-swap tale.

The writing, while subtle, often serves the story well, keeping it grounded and cohesive. Still, I found myself wishing it had taken more risks. The film hints at satire-touching on corporate greed and the plight of the working class-but these themes feel underdeveloped. Aziz introduces these ideas but stops short of provoking real conversation or emphasizing their weight. There's no call to action, only a quiet resignation, as if the challenge was too great to fully confront.

That said, Aziz excels in prioritizing the existential elements that make his characters feel relatable. He navigates a familiar plot structure with finesse, infusing it with sharp humor, a seasoned and well established cast that understands the power of good timing, and a charming simplicity that makes the film feel both intimate and universal.",figurative
"It's Even Worse Than My Worst Fears After suffering through those aggressively unfunny trailers, I was concerned this one might turn out to be the worst situation comedy of the decade. My fears were misaligned: it's truly much worse than I'd been led to believe.

From the stale jokes and pedestrian plot lines to the overall concept of the show, I was wrestling with why watching this mess had left me nearly speechless. Then it dawned on me: this is the worst TV show since Jerry O'Connell's notorious ""sitcom"" Do Not Disturb (DND). Like DND, St. Denis takes real talents like Alison Tolman and David Alan Grier and squanders their efforts.",figurative

"Gritty series, corruption permeates the air in Kingstown as destitute men live only long enough to await their imminent demise as street justice is meted out This series has already shown its potential as a top notch crime/drama TV series just based on the first episode. Jeremy Renner is a bona fide A-lister film star who signed on to this TV series knowing just how well written it was and which includes a stellar supporting cast of TV and film stars that will allow the series to keep its audience glued to the series episodes each week which I am sure will continue for a few seasons more.

Co-creator and TV and film star in his own right, Hugh Dillon, is quite familiar with the physical location the series was shot which is in Kingston, Ontario, Canada, as he was born in this small town that is best known for housing the Kingston Penitentiary for hard core long term serving criminals.

The series has a real life feel, corruption exists as we all know it exists, but in Kingstown we get to see who is managing the scales of justice. Justice as only street justice exists in Kingstown, and Jeremy Renner who plays Mike McLusky confronts it head on and then dictates how justice will be meted out.

This is going to be the most highly acclaimed crime/drama TV series since the 1999 Sopranos.

Prediction: Multiple Emmy awards over multiple seasons. I can't wait for more episodes to be aired.

I give the series a perfect 10 out of 10 IMDB rating.",literal
"Just fine, nothing more nothing less A movie that is about to kickstart an entire new age in dc, i think this movie is doing just decent job at it. And that may or may not be a good thing for some. To me it isn't unfortunately.

For quite some years now many superhero projects movies, tv shows and games seem to have found a new direction which is more or less focused on comedic elements and fan service, and to me and what it seems to many others, i believe it is taking away some of that spark many superhero projects used to have.

Superman (2025) is in my honest opinion as a movie is just fine, decent, okay, and at times it can have good moments. But as a superhero and especially a superman movie it's starts to have bit more issues.

The movie in many ways is similar to recent dc and marvel movies. From its comedic tone, to breaking emotional scenes with comedy. Sure there are some serious moments, but far too little.

When you have a chance of a lifetime especially during these times when superhero fatigue is at its worst, this movie in quite few ways doesn't do anything to separate from it.


* Music was decent at times, it didn't really have your usual overly orchestral pieces which is good thing. Though the movie didn't found its own theme and rather it relies on arrangement of reeves one. I don't think many will remember this movies score or theme in the long-run which is kinda unfortunate.



* Visuals and colors were one of the movies worse parts, It didn't have distinct look or feel to it and looked most of the movie like The flash movie. At times the movie looked like an ad or just dull, lack of colors. I thought artistically Smallville from 20yrs ago has better look and warmth feel to it than this movie.



* Cinematography for the most part was bad, too many close-ups, fisheye lenses and shaky movement, but thats to be expected from the same cinematographer who also did the flash. Come to think of it i even prefer many of the cinematic moment from the flash show more than what was shown in this movie.


I really can't fathom the idea that someone like James Gunn who had directed already plenty of superhero movies before has a one in a lifetime chance to do superman movie he wants, but ends up to delivering very similar movie to the ones he already did, and what we have seen last 6+ years now. When you have a chance to do of all superhero characters an a superman, i think he delivered an a superhero movie, not an a superman.

All in all i think this is the kind of a movie that quite many will enjoy, but i think its not the one that would leave same type impact like 1978 left.

I don't think this is the movie people would put posters in their walls.",literal
"Madness, Masks, and Aster at His Wildest I'll forever watch anything Ari Aster makes - and 'Eddington' is no exception. An explosive, provocative, and messy satirical western, it drops us right into the peak of lockdown: empty streets, masks, paranoia, and people slowly losing it.

In a ghost-town New Mexico city, Sheriff Joe Cross (Joaquin Phoenix) refuses to wear a mask - not just because of his asthma, but because no one tells a ""free man"" what to do. His rival? Mayor Ted Garcia (Pedro Pascal) - mid-election campaign, enforcing lockdown rules, hiding shady ties to Cross's wife (Emma Stone), and pushing a giant server farm project. A petty grudge quickly spirals into a political war.

This is Phoenix's show - evolving from overlooked nobody into a vengeful demon who forgets why he started. Aster layers in Black Lives Matter protests, conspiracy-fuelled social media spirals, pandemic hysteria, and far too many gunfights - until the whole thing becomes a chaotic portrait of a world that's completely lost the plot.

COVID here is a black mirror, warping reality until it shatters. And once again, Ari Aster proves he's in a league of his.",literal
"Amazing I've been a fan of the show since the pilot, all those years ago. Waiting for these new episodes has been, well, hell. Bit it was worth it. While the cast change can be something to get accustomed to, they did an amazing job. Loved it, loved all the four episodes. The pacing is sometimes slower than I expected, but the songs more than make up for it. The new additions to the ensemble feel well thought out and interesting. Sure, you have to watch the first episode on YouTube to fully get the series, but come on! How hard is that? It's YouTube. It's free. Go watch it, I promise you it's great. And while you're there, watch Helluva Boss too.",literal
"Awesome at start, decent in the end In my opinion this series started out brilliantly on a very interesting premise. But later I think the series started to lose its own credibility. It suffered from the same fate a lot of series have these days: they throw in everything they got at the start to actually make an impression. But that leaves them with only so much for the remaining seasons.

*** CONTAINS SPOILERS BELOW ***

After a few seasons, you know the trick and you start wondering how Walter and his unstable friend can dodge so many bullets. His sidekick Jesse started to become really obsolete, and quite frankly annoyed me up to the point that I was actually praying for some gang member to end his life sooner than later. A guy that is constantly nagging and feeling so sorry for himself is only interesting for so long. After that he just becomes annoying. Personally I think this is a result of just dragging on for far too long with a series on a same premise. It becomes a one-trick pony. It would've served the series better if they'd cut it down a season or two.",literal

"These are supposed to be doctors? The enormous flaws in the show are immensely obvious. Surgeons are seen doing everything in patient care from diagnosis to running tests, MRIs and followup care.

Surgeons don't do this! Diagnosis is done by a physician who refers someone for surgery. The Chief of surgery doesn't run the hosiutal, an administrator does. Technical professionals run tests. Most patient care is done by nurses.

The doctors carpool as if they don't make $500,000+ per year.

Worse, the female doctors seem to be unaware of this thing called ""birth control"" because they are sexually active and getting ""surprise"" pregnancies.

It's crap.",literal
"Caught me by surprise Like a few others I was very shocked how good this was. I have Law Enforcement experience, and I am very familiar with the FTO, I knew several FTO's just like this. I am always looking for things wrong when I watch cop shows, this one only had one that I did not like, and that was you dont discharge your weapon and then go back to work the next day, but maybe it was a few days later. If you liked Southland (Best COP show EVER) you will like this one.",literal
"Not recommended (EDIT : Second season is better) FIRST SEASON : 6,4/10

I don't know how to rate this.

Every actor here is nearly excellent or excellent. The script is clever, the subtlety is brilliant. This is an accurate depiction of Western civilization's decay. 6 stars for these qualities.

But, it's too cynical.

How can you like a tv series when every character here is kinda disgusting? Belinda was a nice character, Armond was somewhat likeable, but every other character here made me sick. Furthermore, the end is anti-climactic and not cathartic. I get it, there is no salvation, but come on, give me someting to enjoy, even mildly.

I like sad and depressing movies, but this is a new height, disguised as a comedy.

The actors were excellent. But you can't enjoy a movie or a series when almost every character is rotten to the core.

SECOND SEASON : 7,2/10

Second season is improved. Not the cringefest we watched before, these are more well written characters and more likeable. I could identify, to a certain extent, with some of them and i could watch the obnoxious/unlikeable rest of them without feeling sick or disgusted, like i did in the first season.

Furthermore, there was a smooth character development. Everything seemed natural, nothing felt forced nor fake.

Acting is still great, this was never a problem with White Lotus. Every actor here did a great job.

I can't rate it higher because it was not exciting. A comedy/drama, interesting and enjoyable but nothing more, not that vitriolic or brilliant. Ending was much better than the last season's. Whereas it was still not satisfying, i appreciated it because it was partially unpredictable, kinda clever and like every other aspect of this season, it felt natural.",literal
"Loving it so far... Review of Season One:

This is one of those shows I missed the first time around but was eager to catch up with having heard so many good things. Having just watched the short first season, I can report I love it. It starts off strongly with no messing about, and then delves deep into character work for a few episodes before bringing it back on a high at the climax. The acting is of a very fine calibre and the elements of blacker-than-black humour add immeasurably to the entertainment value. A good show all round, and I look forward to seeing where they take it from here.",literal
"Bailey I love the show and all the characters, except Bailey. She doesn't fit with the rest of the cast. Not only that but she is wrong for Nolan. She seems whinny and fake. I love the rest of the original cast and I pray Lucy and Bradford find their way back to each other. They are such a wonderful couple. I hope the writers keep the humor in the show. I also hope when they bring in new rookies they take time to make sure the characters fit with the others. Nothing worse than trying to watch a show where the writers try to force a new character to fit in. I will continue watching in hopes that the show just gets better and better.",literal
"Cheap squid game imitation Again a Netflix serie not so well produced and in this case it looks like a ""cheap"" Japanese imitation of the Korean Squid game serie.

"Jarring It was going to sell...... Mooooaaaanaaa. Moan. Teardrops of pity. Bells and whistles clambering above and behind. It catches you. Moana is a movie of it's own, that speaks it's own language and reaps it's own wounds. Jarring. The ramifications of this movie, if you didn't know it already was, jellies from the distant aftertaste of 'Frozen' and 'Zootopia.' But this picture, if you didn't know it already was, is meant for Hawain culture, made for that specific statute of sensibility. So it's not that funny, but on a yacht at night, with the stars shining upon thee, without a whistle of wind, but the quiet rest of the open sea, and showing this film, if you didn't know it already was one, being shown on an outside projector, with a tropical drink in one hand and a bloody tissue in the other, then can this movie touch the jolts of my heart. What I am saying is this movie requires a journey for you to enjoy it instead of sitting their with a dried up full bag of large popcorn.",figurative
"Amazing but needs to end This show was so addicting at the beginning i watched 5 seasons in 2 weeks which is impressive for me, but after the fifth season it started to get boring the same things are happening again and again there wasn't anything different that made me excited. I still watch it though I can't help but to know what is happening with the gallaghers. So i think 10 seasons should be enough. I'll miss shameless but at least it won't get worse by adding more season.",literal
"Predictable and boring The first episode opened with a somewhat interesting premise, although ruined quite a bit by arriving there via a horribly contrived sequence of events that required way more suspension of disbelief than necessary.

The second episode did not have much of anything going on apart from obvious exposition of things established in the first episode. The third had not a single event of interest happen at all.

And that's where I'm currently at, three episodes in. A flash of a possibly intriguing concept, with nothing to show for it, nor any interesting characters to keep things entertaining. It feels a bit like the first few episodes of Lost, where it seemed like there were interesting things afoot, but almost immediately it became obvious that there was nothing hiding behind the smokescreen.

It is well produced, though. If you're young and haven't read/watched a lot of stories yet, this might be something you haven't seen or thought of before. I'd say you'll know by the end of the second episode if this is something you'll want to keep watching. Personally, there are countless movies and shows I'd rather rewatch than spend any more time on this.",literal
"Too much There's just way too much going on in this show. So many characters and nearly zero character development. We barely know the main cast, and constantly have new characters thrown at us and it doesn't feel like most of them are necessary. I'm pretty sure an 8 episode run would be better served by focusing on the main cast and the threat from Heaven and Adam the entire time.

"Eh... The movie is alright. Sadly I think it's too over-hyped, as with many (if not all) other movies before this one.

It has some catchy songs, the characters were fun. But for me, it doesn't live up to the hype it has gotten ever since it came out. It lacks a bit of backstory on the main characters. In the end it left me with more questions than answers. The music is catchy and it has a basic children's action movie storyline.

All-in-all it's a decent, but definitely not worth the hype, in my eyes.",literal
"A Shift in Focus: From Medical Drama to Social Commentary Grey's Anatomy has been a staple of television drama for many years, captivating audiences with its blend of medical intrigue and personal relationships. However, after Season 11, the series took a turn that didn't resonate with me as much.

While I appreciate the show's efforts to address important social issues, the focus in Season 12 and beyond felt overwhelmingly centered on themes of race and LGBTQ+ representation. While significant in today's cultural climate, this shift often overshadowed the storylines and well-developed characters that initially drew me to the show. The emphasis on social justice narratives sometimes felt forced, detracting from the character development and complex medical cases that made earlier seasons so engaging.

I understand the importance of representation in media, but the balance felt off, making the show feel more like a platform for social commentary rather than a cohesive narrative.

In conclusion, while I commend the creators for their commitment to inclusivity, I miss the nuanced storytelling that characterized the earlier seasons of Grey's Anatomy. I hope future seasons can find a way to blend these important themes with the rich, character-driven plots that made the series a beloved classic.",literal
"Unnecessarily stupid Here we have another ridiculous show that understands neither the medical industry nor human psychology. And didn't get me started on how flippantly they treat policy and even law. There's nothing heartwarming, relatable, realistic, or interesting about this show.

I hated how they handled the sexual assault episode, how they write women in general. The flashbacks, the relationships, the ""twists,"" it's all offensively bad. I can't stand shows that treat audiences like we're morons.",literal
"This show doesn't pretend to be something it's not. Thank You Normally, medical shows aren't my thing since I work in healthcare. I watched The Pitt, which was ultra-realistic, but it just felt like being back at work. I decided to give Doc a try because of the buzz-and because Molly Parker, who I loved in Deadwood, is the lead. I was pleasantly surprised and, more importantly, entertained. I burned through the first 10 episodes on Netflix and I'm glad there's a season 2 coming.

This show doesn't pretend to be something it's not. Is it by the book? No-and that's exactly what makes it good.",literal
"Best. Anime. Ever. When I first heard of One Punch Man, I was skeptical of its premise. But after watching the first episode, I was immediately hooked! I've never seen a show that blends action and comedy so well! The music is great and the characters are very well drawn and acted out.

It may only have English subtitles and only has twelve episodes, I still am enthralled. I also heard that the release date for the second season is sometime late this year, so I don't have to go through another Attack on Titan black hole thing again.

If you are new to anime or even manga, One Punch Man is the right show for you.",literal
"An Okayish Mealtime Mix It's a perfectly fine mealtime film. There's an attempt at building intrigue, and it works decently as long as you're not expecting anything big. It's interesting to see the serious Jack Reacher, Alan Ritchson in this avatar, though I liked him far more comic and intense in The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare. He's not the typical Dwayne Johnson style huge but funny guy, but he's still watchable.

Kevin James, on the other hand, tries a bit too hard with the comedy and ends up being unintentionally serious more than anything else. The action comedy blend is okay, nothing memorable, nothing offensive. One of those films where it's harmless whether you watch it or skip it, background entertainment at best.",literal

"Sirk's obsession with high emotions and lush Technicolor mark this as an achievement Magnificent Obsession is, at least on the surface, about redemption, almost to a wild degree, and then a sense of strange love. It concerns a playboy sportsman, Bob Merrick (Hudson) who gets in an accident and needs a resuscitator just at the same time that Dr. Phillips, who is sick, needs it. He dies while Merrick lives, and this leaves Mrs. Helen Phillips (Jane Wyman) in serious debt. What to do? Well, Merrick offers up some money, but Helen rejects it outright. He tries to do more, but then Helen has an accident of her own when a car hits her, making her blind. From then on Merrick, trying to make up for all of his wrongs, and to find himself really, takes on a persona of 'Robbie Robertson' around the blind Helen Phillips, and goes as far as to try and find a doctor who can cure her blindness. 

Needless to say, he ends up doing much more. Almost above-and-beyond one might say, but who's to really say in love anyway? Douglas Sirk relishes his characters and the setting, but he doesn't deny any side of the audience looking for something. If you love a good soap opera or hardcore melodrama where a twist and turn comes every so many minutes (mostly in the first half, but then some last minute ones of the medical kind towards the end), Sirk gives up the goods like a chef pouring far too much syrup on chocolate chip pancakes. If you want to look for just a lush and amazing piece of film-making, you'll get that, as his DP Russell Metty (also later to work on All That Heaven Allows, his masterpiece starring also Hudson and Wyman), who gets these scenes by a lake or in a nice middle class house or out in Europe where a parade with lots of fire at night shines like something out of a dream (or, equally incredible, his sense of light and dark in indoor night scenes).

And what makes it interesting, if almost too over the top, is how the two collide from time to time. I enjoyed Magnificent Obsession as a weepie, as a story of a woman and a man trying to retain their connection to each other and the world around them, even when a dramatic twist seemed too much. Who is to say what is ever 'too much' in Sirk's work anyway? There is a sense of irony that Sirk has on his characters- how money is often a factor, albeit this time it's addressed more directly than in All That Heaven Allows, and about how far love/redemption should extend like in the final surgery scene with the old man looking down on Hudson like some weird ghost- but it doesn't compromise the real dramatic tension at work. There's high passions at work here, and the style of the color and gloss of the cinematography compliments that, while perhaps suggesting, in its darker scenes, something more turbulent and uncertain in these characters underneath it all.

Magnificent Obsession is a minor gem in 50's melodrama works, where Hudson surprises with his level of depth (that is within his limitations as a star, in this material he can do a lot of good) and Wyman with her tenderness and strength in the face of all Helen's terrors to face (will she or wont she see?), and it carries with it a lot of superb moments and critique on the bourgeoisie.",figurative

"I'd be hard-pressed to think of a similar movie I saw Brotherhood of the Wolf when I was in high school. It got a theatrical run in the United States, as few foreign films really do (especially those not gifted with Academy attention). I recall a commercial breathlessly describing the film as ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon meets The Matrix"", or something along those lines. I rented it from, I believe, the local Hollywood Video based on that hype and came out of it intrigued, but confused. I just didn't know what to make of this genre-mashing French film. But it always stayed in my mind.

I rewatched it recently because I had a nagging feeling I would ""get"" it now. I'd seen more foreign films in the interim and felt I had a better understanding of the vocabulary of international cinema. What I saw in Brotherhood of the Wolf leaves in unquestionably in place on my list of Favorite Movies (not that I have a formal list), or at the very least a spot in the Honorable Mentions.

At nearly two and a half hours, Brotherhood of the Wolf is not a short movie, but it still packs more in that running time than seems possible. It is by turns an action film, an arthouse film, an arthouse-action film, a horror movie, a historical epic, a martial arts extravaganza, a political drama, a romance--I could go on. In a way it feels like an adaptation of a fighting game franchise--say, Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter--dressed up in period clothing, filmed with the grace and elegance of Terence Malick. It's pulpy, it's gory, and it's one of the most visually stunning films you could hope to see. I haven't had this much awe for the use of color in a movie since Bram Stoker's Dracula. At one point characters in the movie are using pumpkins for target practice, and you get the feeling pumpkins were selected for no other reason than that they're bright and colorful and look really cool exploding in slow motion. That sits perfectly fine with me.

Brotherhood of the Wolf is not a perfect movie, by any means--it's messy and unfocused, from a storytelling perspective. But it is a purely cinematic experience in a combination of ways I just can't find in other movies. Sometimes a work of art that is ambitiously flawed is more satisfying, anyhow.",literal
"Excellent Now this show is better than good, better than very good. It runs like the source material that is Fallout games, with all the silly and serious, goofy and dark, bleak and rich..

Regarding the look, tone and feel, the show absolutely knocks it out of the park, or phrased for those extra demanding, does the job very well.

Regarding the story, it would seem it is some sort of a Grand Story, that dives into and connects it all, from back before the Great War, to more than two centuries after..

Point is that at this point, Fallout show is just getting started..",figurative
Great not sure why this had an RPX option! McKenna Grace is absolutely stunning nowadays she was so good in this and the acting was so great!

"Dark humor, complex plot - from the same author as Slow Horses If you enjoy the brilliant acting, complex story lines and dark humor of Slow Horses, as my husband and I do, this will be a fine show for you. It's based on a novel by the same author who wrote the novels on which Slow Horses is based. If you lack an appreciation of dark humor and the absurdity of the traditional, slick spy movie is lost on you, then you won't like it. Some folks will utterly not get this series, likely overlapping with those who don't enjoy Slow Horses. My husband and I have been laughing out loud at times, and after 3 episodes, we're into it.",literal
Big surprise I was convinced I wasn't going to enjoy this as soon as I heard it was in production. I was completely wrong. Aside from the usual ugly CGI it was genuinely a bit scary & quite good.

"the last movie for this writer Disgruntled CIA agent Haley Bennett (Sidney) got involved in a case where her trainee goes off the rails. Great set-design, beautiful landscape in Alaska during the winter. Jason Clarke (Frank), the marshal who prioritizes his work over his family for too many years shows up to a jet plane crash in the wilderness without his gun out. The he uses a 22 caliber gun that requires four direct shots to bring a man down. The prison transport passengers that survive crash expand near Fairbanks in all directions and surprisingly the Alaskan people are helpless. I've been to Alaska and more people have knives and guns on their body than they do in the 19th century wild West. Frank's son, Tait Blum (Luke) leaves school during a lock down to travel with his gf to a remote cabin in the tundra of Alaska without chains, extra fuel, no food, no battery back-up, no cell service, no landline, just a bottle of champagne. I want to like it but it's just a mess in a pretty place. Dominick Cooper, (Havelock) and Simone Kessell, (Sarah) are fantastic but not enough to save this unrealistic plot.",literal
"Crusty old curmudgeon Gary Oldman plays the quintessential crusty old curmudgeon, an MI5 spy left over from the Cold War (and ostracised to Slough House), still parrying at shadows, and seeing real threats before anyone else.

This is stylised Cold War spy craft in a modern setting - and it's a very satisfying watch. Another well-realised show that creates its immediate world with details of environment, character (and subterfuge) - the indispensable building blocks of good story telling.

If you're just coming upon this show now that season 2 is released you should do yourself a favour and binge season 1 first - it's a good yarn and will offer a depth of character and situation that will add to your enjoyment

Season 2 appears to have lifted the game in terms of production design and cinematography - it's really paid off and elevated the show above the usual weekly episodic grind TV.

Highly recommended - Oldman and Kristin Scott-Thomas are terrific, as are Jack Lowden and Saskia Reeves.",literal
"Funny and heartwarming Jim Carrey is excellent as the Grinch. Hilarious in his ""I insist on being grumpy and hateful"" role and ofcourse, lots of physical comedy.

"Hanging out with the Gallaghers I don't know if you can call 2011 the year the BBC invaded American television, but it comes darn close. The first of the shows to premiere in the new year will be Showtime's version of the British award winning Shameless. Shameless follow Frank Gallagher, played by William H. Macy, and his not quite normal family. For instance the youngest of the Gallagher clan is quite obviously not Frank's yet that isn't even the family's biggest concern. Nor would it be the fact that in order to make ends meet and keep the electricity from being turned off all the kids chip in including the youngest daughter who takes up a collection that is supposed to be turned into Unicef. Yeah those are problems alright, but like I said they aren't the Gallagher's biggest problem. Their biggest problem would be Frank and his inability to stay sober long enough to pay more than his bar tab at the neighborhood pub.

With that being said the first 21 minutes of Shameless doesn't detour much from the British version and that's OK. Instead of feeling as though I had seen it before (which I had) I just felt as though I was being introduced to a new slightly (overly) dysfunctional family. This was mostly in part to the cast who not only owned their roles they owned whatever scenes they were in and I don't say this lightly. Not once during the preview did I feel as though this was a family I was supposed to pity and feel bad for. This was a family I wanted to know and to hang out with. Luckily for me starting Sunday January 9, 2011 I get to hang out with the Gallagher family.",literal
"This was great! Really enjoyed it. The raft scene stole the show for me. Most of the characters were good.

I swear the major things most movies are missing these days are a solid all the way through sound score. Some of the more tense Dino scenes would've benefited greatly if they had removed the canned action background music and replaced it with more a slow tense build the drama/fear score. Sometimes let's just hear the waterfall in the background or the trees in the wind. Silence can be a great suspense builder.

Still some problems here and there with CGI. I always prefer real props as much as possible.

Overall though very pleased with this addition.",literal
"Story is great, Danes is Not Is there a reason why every character Danes plays, she does this annoying heavy breathing even when performing mundane tasks like walking to a car?

"Bizarre, ballsy, and absurd, in the best way possible. Once again, Yorgos Lanthimos doesn't shy away from demonstrating some of the most absurd yet unique takes on filmmaking and storytelling with this absurd comedy-thriller, filled with great conspiracy-based concepts, atmospheres, and direction take.

For starters, this is a remake from the Korean movie ""Save the Green Planet!"", which I didn't really like and found the writing and the structure to be messy and quite unlikable. However, Bugonia is one of the rare examples where the remake ends up being a whole new experience and I say, better than the original. Lanthimos's direction on the tone, atmosphere and writing remains powerful and striking. As his direction on how he explores the characters, the themes, the personalities, and the meanings of humanity and society is striking and vibrant. Lanthimos never shys away from being dramatic and comedic at the same time, while exploring the dark concepts perfectly.

Alongside with great production designs, camerawork, colorful presentation, and sound designs, the dialogue and the characters are quite interesting. The characters felt disturbed, weird, yet engaging to observe as many dialogue moments between them, and their chemistry together were absurd, yet, electrifying. The performances from the cast were all great. Emma Stone was great, but Jesse Plemons and Aidan Delbis really stand out on playing the two roles. Plemons goes on all unhinged-mode and Delbis portraying shyness and awkwardness was perfect.

Many of the themes were hilarious and disturbing as well. Reflecting on about brainwashing, politics, people, unhinge sanity and the veins of people, and it even does reflect on some of the points of today's time, especially with the current society of people and behavior.

At the end, Lanthimos proves as one of the best filmmakers in our current landscape.",literal
Some extra detail This is a flashlight on a corner of American history that has been forgotten. Wonderful production detail that evokes a bygone era. I just have one complaint. No one in Hollywood knows how a hanging was properly done even when its a vital pary of the plot. A proper hangmans knot had thirteen loops and that one had only five. The noose was placed behind the left ear and that one was behind the head. The result would not have gone well. It ends with a hanging but every student of history knew that from the beginning so its not a spoiler.,literal
"Mixed feelings, ok sequel I really enjoyed The Black Phone and was really excited for number 2 as I was interested in finding out more about The Grabber and his backstory.

I assumed his backstory would start at the lake they went to visit but unfortunately this wasn't explored at all.

I actually did enjoy this sequel though. It felt a lot like Sinister, Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street all in one. I love how it truly felt that it was set in the 80s, just like the first one having that real retro 70s feel.

Lots more gore which wasn't too overdone but there was still some corny scenes. The actors all did a fantastic job and the Blake family had a really nice connection to wrap the story up. Really really wish the backstory was explored but oh well. Hopefully there won't be a number 3 because that would really just be pointless.",literal
"They are all monsters (Mendenez) ""Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story"" on Netflix.

I couldn't watch the Dahmer series that precedes this one. I did watch this. I had zero recollection of the brothers, this crime and all the followed.

I have to say that as I stumbled through this it started to occur to me that everyone is a monster in one way or another. The parents. The two brothers. The therapist. The lawyers. There's not a single likable character. They are all terrible people.

It is relentlessly violent and gruesome.

It's not ""clever"" (as is Wyatt Earp and the Cowboy Wars), and has no humor. It is just relentless. It is disturbing and unpleasant. It's awful.

Numerous times I thought I should stop watching it, and yet... I persisted. It's crazy but I did so even though I did not really like it.

There is what I think is very good acting. One episode is just Eric and his lawyer, with the latter's back to the camera. It feels like it was filmed in one take and it is incredible. The actor playing Eric is crazy good.

I don't know if I recommend this. It goes way beyond True Crime. I think it might be good filmmaking though. It reminds me a bit of The Bear in that the episodes are very distinct with a specific topic or subject.

I give this a seven. It's well done, and as I said the acting is superb.",figurative
"An outstanding series The standard of writing, directing and acting on this series could not be higher. It's not just the complex, absorbing plots that draw you in. It's how they unfold in unpredictable but clearly articulated ways it's a series that never talks down to viewers. Even though, on the surface, it's a conventional police and legal procedural, it keeps your attention and always entertains you and makes you think. There are no personal sub-plots, which is quite extraordinary. Sam Waterston is great, but we'll never see the likes of the wonderful, late actor Jerry Orbach again. He was witty, intelligent, gritty, but also never lost that human touch. May he Rest In Peace.",literal
"Started getting a little tiresome I really enjoyed the show at first and would always look forward to the next episode. Having said that, the unhealthy codepency between Sam and Dean, especially Dean who is willing to sacrifice anything and everyone so that he and Sam could continue their little adventure together, started getting old. I still watch occasionally and have enjoyed some of the characters that have come and gone, God/Chuck comes to mind as a good one and Crowley was awesome. Still, when I do watch, I find myself kinda hoping Sam and Dean get obliterated.",literal
"Fast-paced dark comedy One Battle After Another is the off-beat, quirky, and irreverent action-comedy of the year.

Director Paul Thomas Anderson manages to balance non-stop, kinetic action and comedy in equal measure, largely thanks to the genuinely surprising comedic performance of Leonardo DiCaprio. Leo provides much of the film's essential comic relief as a paranoid revolutionary, offering a performance unlike anything he's done before.

The driving force of the narrative is Sean Penn's hugely dislikeable character, Colonel Lockjaw, who heads a menacing squad of villains relentlessly chasing the protagonists and giving the film its adrenaline-fueled structure. The entire ensemble is fantastic, from the experienced heavyweights to Teyana Taylor, who is firmly cementing her status as a powerhouse actor in major roles. Don't blink or you'll miss a nice cameo from Alana Haim (of girl band Haim fame).

This explosive, anarchic masterpiece is an absolute blast and is surely lined up for a raft of nominations come awards season.",figurative
"Solid film Going into this, I had no idea it was a true story and it pleasantly surprised me. The characters were likeable, the pacing was good, and there is nothing that I can say is bad about this movie. Channing Tatum did a great job at going from fun to serious and it felt real. This is a good movie to see with your family and I never really got bored during this. Would recommend!",literal
"High Potential has potential I love the idea of the show and that as a murder/cop show, at least so far, has been pretty family friendly. The victims scenes aren't overly graphic. It isn't disturbing. I love that it has a base storyline mystery that continues from one episode to the next. She is a likable character, not overly snarky, rude, obnoxious. So far, no cheesy love relationships.

What keeps it from being a home run in my opinion is they need to find a balance between her being exceptional smart and observate and making the other ""normal"" characters looking stupid and inept. There are things that she figures out in some episodes that the seasoned police officers would have certainly noticed with her assistance. It seems to happen a lot with her partner. And the make the police chief seem helpless without her. Once they find the balance of leaving the other officers smart and competent and her being exceptional it will be a great show. There are a few plot holes in a couple episodes I noticed (especially episode 2) but that seems to be with any cop show. Overall, I like it.",figurative
"Fantastic distraction! Ok, we can all agree many successful journeys-to-wherever narratives ratchet up the action sequences to crescendo into bigger, better, bloodier, and Sisu 2 is no different. You'll enjoy the passing of each chapter, just so long as you don't think too much about logistics or motivations. The largely dialogue-less screenplay benefits from zero zingers and relies on the emotive countenance and eyes. Grunts, groans and growls aside of course. In short, this is a good use of your movie viewing capital as it delivers a well-paced tale of loss, struggle, and sweet, sweet - and yes, very bloody (though not overly gruesome) - revenge.",literal
"It just doesn't work I really wanted to love this despite Kim being in it, I mean the cast & production are second to none, so why is it so bad? The acting seems so fake like none of them are playing a character they're just reading the lines and don't even get me started about the lines because they're pretty terrible. A show about women taking down rich powerful men on paper sounds damn good but it comes across as just women man ""bashing"" I didn't believe these were powerful lawyers and I don't think they believed it either. I have watched 3 episodes which was very difficult, I wanted to stop after the first one but I hoped it may improve but alas it did not.",literal
"This isn't a police procedural, it's a family drama. My first impression from the pilot is that this series is a DUD. It's driven by workplace and familial drama, it's not focused on solving crimes and apprehending criminals. This is an evening soap opera, like its companion ""Fire Country"". Dick Wolf and Ryan Murphy's productions aren't perfect, but they're so much better than ""Sheriff Country"" and it's equally bad companion.

The lead doesn't cut it. I've always been a fan of Matt Lauria from his days on ""Friday Night Lights"". The rest of the cast is hit and miss. ""Fire Country"" gets renewed because there is an audience someplace, I'm not one. ""Murder in a Small Town"" from Fox/Disney is so much better.",figurative
"Visually beautiful This movie, about Moana who answers the Ocean's call to seek out Maui to set things right, is a good computer animation movie!

It rushes at times including the essential scenes, and there is a bit too much musical content for me. Also, I think the backstory is weak and it has a little lack of emotional engagement.

Anyway, it is visually stunning! The animation has beautiful colors and lots of details, and every scene is a feast for the eyes, especially with its cultural elements. The movie has much to be entertained by despite my criticism, and it is rarely boring. It has many memorable scenes, like the private scene and the climax, and its humor is somewhat appealing. A worthy experience nonetheless!

Despite its rushed pacing and excessive musical content, this is a visually stunning movie with vibrant animation and cultural richness. While the backstory and emotional engagement may be lacking, the movie offers memorable scenes and humor, making it an entertaining and worthy experience.",figurative
"I like Superman for the first time I've never been able to get into Superman at all. The cornpone aw-shucks-ness of the character has always struck me as boring.

But David Corneswet has pulled off a performance that compensates for the characters' deficiencies by being both earnest and vulnerable, ironic for the invulnerable man of steel.

Another excellent performance: Edi Gathegi as Mr. Terrific, an egotistical genius who is also just a lot of fun, which is more than I can say for poor Lex Luthor, who is reduced to being a headcase with a major inferiority complex.

There's a story about Superman saving the world blah blah blah, that part is pretty standard. The bigger significance is that this sets up the bigger DC-verse that is now under the thumb of James Gunn and his candy-coated happy-face song-drenched approach, whether you like it or not.

We get a Green Lantern with a terrible haircut to prep us for the series coming next year (?) and Rick Flag Sr. Makes a glowering appearance to synch up with his characters' actions in the recently-concluded Peacemaker series.",literal
"Man height mentioned 10 too many times. The movie is nicely done, quite entertaining visually, but very shallow and it does not get better. Talking about man 170cm as wouldn't be full-right human (does not get better by the end of the movie). Both my husband and my son are rather short, so I'm happy they didn't see it with me. I think only rich, very good looking people might find it funny or meaningful.",literal
"A Uniquely Weird & Wonderful Comedy, for Weirdos. I look forward to watching this series each week. Its different, simple & funny. All in its own uncanny way.

You need to accept that it's not everyones flavour of comedy. Infact, it's borderline fringe. No canned laughter, somewhat unpredictable gaglines and brilliant characters.

Entertainment needs more films and TV like this. Regardless of gender, sexuality, age, race, social background or disability, everyone is weirdo and relatable in their own way. Which makes the chair company unpredictable and unqiue.",literal
Reminds me of the movie The Accountant. Seems to be the guy solving problems for people who are unable to handle the situation themselves. It looks very familiar that it really looks like a TV version of the movie The Accountant. They had to wind it down a little. They didn't want an R rating or TV a PG14. I have enjoyed the first 3 episodes and hope it continues to have good writing and quality characters. I shall continue to watch and see if it stays at an above average level. I like the main character but I also like the support people. The guy he calls that is a wizard with computer stuff and the two women who find assignments for him. His lawyer is good too. And he has some interesting history too.,literal
"A solid drama with influences that are all over the palce... Yellowstone is a solidly written drama - great characters, well-crafted - that draws it's tone from a few different modern-day masterpieces.

It has the feel and cinematography of Longmire, the plotting and grim outlook of The Sopranos, and the dramatic dynamics of shows like 'Dynasty' or any of the other network dramas similar to that.

Much respect must go to Costner and Cole Hauser - these guys bring it 100%.

I did not expect to get drawn in to this show like I did. It's well worth your time.",literal
"Pretty good so far! It's nowhere near on par with ""The Office"" or ""Parks and Rec"" (nothing ever will be), but it's got some laugh out loud moments. It reminds me a lot of Superstore, although that could be because half the cast came from that show. I can see how it's not for everyone, but it's definitely a lot better than most of the comedies I've seen released in the last few years. As one of the other reviews said, the comedic style is a bit more like the characters are cracking jokes with each other than trying to make the audience laugh. But there were some funny enough moments to make up for that, in my opinion. I'm looking forward to seeing where it goes!",figurative
Best TV Show ever I have been watching this TV show since I was a child and it does not disappoint. Please watch it.,literal
"Great new show! I thought ""Tracker"" is a very good new series. Interesting and mind provoking it kept me on the edge for the entire time. Lokking forward to next weeks show. I've seen Justin Hartley in a few shows before and he consistently does a great job playing his characters. I remember Robin Weigert from Avenue of the Giants. That was really good and I thought that she did a fantastic job in her role. I also remember her from Big Little Lies when she played a doctor. She did a great job with that part also. I have read a few of Jeffrey Deavers book before. The Bone Collector was really good eventhough it dives deep into the psyche of a New York City serial killer. The murderer was a very creep individual. I also watched the offshoot called Lincoln Rhyme: Hunt for the Bone Collector which was also very good. Russell Hornsby did a really good job as Lincoln Rhyme.

I think the Tracker should do very well. So far it is compelling and very well done.",literal
"You'll float too... This film had very high expectations from most people going in given it's excellent marketing campaign. It's crazy to think that it's first trailer is the most viewed trailer of all time within twenty- four hours beating the likes of huge franchise movies like ""Star Wars"" and ""Transformers"". However, it just goes to show how popular Stephen King's novel ""It"" and the property as a whole really is. People really like being scared by clowns for some reason. Anyway, I'm glad to say that this film not only met my expectations but wildly exceeded them.

The movie just like the novel follows the seven teenagers of the self-proclaimed ""Loser's club"" in the seemingly timid town of Derry, Maine as they are terrorized by an entity simply called ""It"". This entity takes the form of your worst fears but usually appears as a 'Pennywise the dancing clown' to lure children in before essentially brutally devouring them. Each of the kids at some point are confronted by ""It"" as he torments them with his shape-shifting abilities. But with all their courage and teamwork they must overcome their fears in order to rid the town of ""It"".

A really interesting thing about the story and each of the character's respective arcs is that it's not just the entity that causes them problems that they must learn to deal with. Instead most of the characters have very tangible conflicts. For example, Bill must deal with the loss of his younger brother, Eddie has an overbearing Mother which makes him a hypochondriac, Beverly has an abusive Father and they all deal with viscous bullying at the hands of the ""Bowers gang"". All of this realism gives the film a cerebral feel which is then complimented by the supernatural terror provided by ""It"". 

The reason this film works so well is because it nails down three- dimensional characters in a human story about childhood, fear, courage and friendship. The writing, directing and acting are all to thank for that. The director Andy Muschietti and the writers including Cary Fukunaga clearly understood the essence of the novel and what they needed to keep and remove to keep the film's pace steady.

The cast of mostly unknowns is superb with the standouts for me being Finn Wolfhard as Ritchie who was hilarious, Jack Dylan Grazer as Eddie who was also funny but really gave his character innocence and vulnerability too and Jaeden Lieberher who gave a nuanced performance as the leader of the ""Loser's club"", Bill.

Bill Skarsgards gives a delightfully creepy turn as Pennywise which heightens the tension of any scenes he appears in. If I had to pick one gripe with this film it's that some of the main characters such as Stanley and Mike are not really developed as well as the others but hopefully this will be rectified in part two when they are adults.

But other than, all in all, this is a great adaptation of one of Stephen King's greatest and most popular novels and I can't wait for part two.",literal
"Deconstructing grief Hamnet is an exceptional movie - its only weakness being that it tries unnecessarily too hard to extract a tear at every turn, drawing on the full armamentarium of tools available to a crafty storyteller like Chloe Zhao. Ultimately, the movie takes you on a journey through life of a typically family. William meets Agnes, Agnes gets pregnant, they get married, they face difficulties in their lives and work, they have twins, they are protective of their children and premonitory about losing a child too. William has to spend significant time in London for work. They lose a child to pestilence. They process grief in their own way.

This movie has all the necessary ingredients to cater to a wide range of audiences and their respective beliefs about reconciling that kind of grief: ghosts, afterlife, mystical forest, abyss, dark holes, underworld (yes, Orpheus' story is woven into the story too), sky burial, perhaps a dream, too. Stillbirth that was not, connection between twins, mysterious connection with nature - a buffet of transcendent beliefs. There are twists too, not unlike those in The Six Sense or The Others. All leading to a catharsis that may have been more profound, if one were not already in tears throughout the whole movie. But, it was therapeutic and liberating, nevertheless. Jessie Buckley, Paul Mescal and Jacobi Jupe contribute masterfully to every single emotional exploitation in this well-crafted deconstruction of grief and Hamlet.

My wife and I watched the premiere at TIFF, with the Roy Thomson Hall always being an unmatchable, immersive venue to watch a movie, particularly one with a score like Hamnet's, supporting and amplifying the tension-building moments with Max Richter's intense music. As I have already pointed to Chloe Zhao not missing a single opportunity to draw on whatever values the audience may already have, here is the use of ""On the Nature of Daylight"" track (amplifying so intensely the preordained loss of a child to rare disease in Arrival). On the one hand, it was incredible to watch Chloe Zhao and Emily Watson's reactions to the movie, as it unfolded, just across the aisle from us. On the other hand, it was impossible to contain the emotional rollercoaster this movie has trapped us in - less than a year ago (on a trip through Denmark, of all places, where Hamlet is set), our three year old son caught severe pneumonia, deteriorated in the middle of the night from what appeared like a bad cold into a near comatose condition. Despite getting him to one of the best pediatric hospitals in the world, over the next week, the infection got worse and we endured for days holding and watching his near-lifeless septicemic body, not knowing whether he will wake up the same and whether he will wake up at all. This was a traumatic experience in a foreign country that left its scars. Watching Hamnet made us relive all of this in a span of two hours - that immeasurable, unimaginable, irreversible loss of a child full of unadulterated joy, dreams, aspirations, potential. I last felt this way when I watched Manchster by the Sea, but that was before I would come to experience my own child. Hamnet is portrayed in the movie to die from what appears as pneumonic plague - rare, but most rapidly progressing - in agony - it is devastating. Yet, we had a happy ending of sorts - our child survived. But it was crashing to watch the family on screen process this grief in their own way. It was beautiful to see them endure. We are drawn to tragedy in a paradoxical manner. Chloe Zhao knows and fully embraces that throughout her work, but also by preparing the audience for the experience (yes - there was a brief breathing exercise and meditation) and providing some closure in her commentary after - we live, we experience loss and grief, most of us find what to continue living for (to be or not to be), and we die, inevitably. I can only speculate, but she appears to have gone for absolute certainty to reach into the very soul of every person in the audience and touch them and unite them with strangers around the room with her masterful storytelling. There is much, much more to be said about this movie than I have. It is a must see and will surely collect many awards for its creators, but, most importantly, will solidify its place in art and history as a masterpiece.",figurative
"A nit to pick about the new guy For years, Gary Cole has played so many a-holes so convincingly - including his start in this role - that it will take a while to embrace him as the new Gibbs. But that's the minor issue.

On NCIS: LA, Deeks functioned as a team member for nearly a decade, though technically on loan from LAPD. When the police department eliminated his position, he had to go through the NCIS training academy like a total newbie just to retain the job he'd been doing so well for so long. Cole's character gets canned by the FBI and walks right into Gibbs' position as the friggin' boss without missing a beat. If he can do that, then Marty Deeks was really shafted. Shame on somebody.",literal

Typical holiday movie Very cheesy and some family friendly fun. Exactly what you expect from holiday films. There were points that touched on their dynamic as family in business together. So a layer of honesty or vulnerability was added. But its balanced well with the jokes so the film is light hearted. Makes you miss spending time with your family.,literal

"Hyped AF, emotional rollercoaster... but not mind-blown. A solid sequel, but yeah... expectations backfired. (8.5/10)

Waited a whole year after Part 1, so obviously I walked into Wicked: For Good with my hype in the stratosphere. Part 2 > Part 1 (I gave Part 1 an 8), but it didn't fully hit the ""wow, masterpiece"" zone. 8.5 feels right.

Twists? Cool, but not shocking since I already knew them from the stage show. The real letdown? Elphaba vs. Wizard showdown - should've been deep, messy, emotional. Instead... kinda brushed past it.

Dorothy? Blink and you miss her. Zero build-up, zero impact. Felt like she was just there because... well, rules.

BUT - performances? Chef's kiss.

Cynthia Erivo ate ""No Good Deed."" She DEVOURRRRED it. Pure vocal chaos in the best way.

Ariana Grande? Shocked me. Acting soft but strong, vocals angel-level. Entire cast? Held it down even when pacing dipped.

And yeah... ""For Good"" still broke me. That ending hits different every time.

Bottom line: Part 2 > Part 1, just not the earth-shattering finale the hype promised.

Solid 8.5/10. No regrets.",figurative
"Fun Bingeable Little Show So I first heard about this show couple weeks ago on The Official Podcast and didn't know, and still don't know the creators.

And Didn't think much of it then because I thought it's gonna be another ""Youtuber makes a cringey mediocre tv show"" scenarios, but due to the popularity and ratings and most importantly, the short runtime, I said why not, let's give it a try.

And it was quite enjoyable. Nothing too mind-blowing or something that make me say ""holy sht this is a masterpiece"", but it's good enough.

It's not a laugh-out-loud funny, but it made me exhale because the funni from time to time and it has a really good and chuckle-worthy dark sense of humor and lots of scenes that might be disturbing or shocking to some.

And lots, and I really mean lots and lots of meme potential. I actually think I watched an episode worth of memes from the ""look Pim"" scene before even watching this show.

I think all the voice-actors did a good job and Zach Hadel's voice is really unique and I like it.

I especially really like the animation style which is unique and they mix the 2d with 3d and stop-motion beautifully and there's always something in the background.

The animation is never stale or horrible to look like the lazy Family Guy stagnant animation style which only has a character blinking in a still image from time to time.

All in all, it's a really fun show to watch and it's easy to get into it, the animation is great and the voice acting is good.

Hope there will be more seasons with more episodes in the future.",figurative
"Bad adaptation but amazing show Sad to see they changed so many foundational things from the books for this adaptation but as a series it is top tier. Sorry to those wanting a faithful adaptation, this seems to be just a great show loosely based on the book.

I originally watched the show on AMC+ and am happy to see it is doing well on Netflix so I can start recommending it more. It is a smart show that does a great job not giving too much exposition.

Acting is great from all three leads and the supporting cast. Zahn McClaron is phenomenal. The unspoken relationship/tension between Chee and Bernadette is palpable, the actors seem to have great chemistry. Some pretty awesome guest stars so far, Rainn Wilson (Dwight from the Office) and Jeri Ryan (7 of 9 from Star Trek). The use of Dine (Navajo) culture and language just gets better moving into season two. Season two they did seem to take an artistic noir approach to the cinematography (which I loved). Season 2's new villains were great and the ending was chef's kiss in my opinion.

I did like the supernatural undertone they had towards the beginning of season 1 and would love to see more of that.

I am super excited for season 3, looks like it is done filming and coming out next year.",figurative
"A shadow of what it once was! I loved this show when it first started ( I scored it a solid 9) and continued to up until the end of Season 13.....That is where it should have finished. With nearly all the original cast gone and poor Ducky semi-retired, Gibbs is left floundering on his own with lots of new cast members that just have not worked, least of all is Maria Bello whose character does very little apart from get in the way, and for a character that is supposed to be getting in peoples heads to interrogate or help them, she seems to need more help than all of them put together. Gibbs just seems lost and coasting, I know this show has been green lit for a 16th Season and I really do think that should be it, but I am sure that the powers that be will flog this horse long after its dead. This show is a tired shadow of what it was and should hang up its gun and badge while it still has a pulse. (and don't even get me started on NCIS:LA, a generic cop show that they just stuck NCIS on the front of to sell it, a regurgitation of what they did with CSI Miami (Cops in the sun), New Orleans is better but still a poor relation. Rant over.

Now as we are entering Season 18 i can say that the new Characters have grown on me just a little bit. Its still not a patch on the earlier series but i am still watching.",literal
"Sylvester Stallone Role is mind blowing ""Tulsa King"" is a gripping crime drama that follows the story of Dwight ""The General"" Manfredi, a mafia capo who is exiled to Tulsa, Oklahoma, after his release from prison. The series is led by Sylvester Stallone who delivers an outstanding performance as the lead character, Dwight 'The General' Manfredi. He brings a strong presence and intensity to the role, and his portrayal of the character is both authentic and compelling.

The series follows Manfredi as he builds a new criminal empire in Tulsa, with the help of a group of unlikely characters. The series explores themes of redemption, power, and loyalty, as Manfredi struggles to navigate the unfamiliar territory of Tulsa and maintain his grip on the criminal underworld.

The story is well-written and keeps the audience engaged throughout the series. The supporting cast is also strong, with each character bringing their own unique perspective to the story. The cinematography and direction are top-notch, and the series has a great pacing that keeps the audience on the edge of their seat.

Overall, ""Tulsa King"" is a must-watch for fans of the crime drama genre. The series offers a captivating story, strong performances, and a unique take on the world of organized crime.",figurative
"Christmas Giggles I have just read the lead comment for this film that is on the front page with the voting results and cast run down.

Why is it that some people can not take a film for what it is supposed to be.

This film is supposed to be a light hearted, tonge in cheek, family comedy, things to make the kids laugh and things for the adults, and that is exactly what this film does.

I laughed my nuts off at this film, I thought Carey put in a great performance and the whole film (if watched at Christmas) really give you a bit of festive cheer

So to all of you film reviewers stop trying to sound like film students and knock every film because it is not ""Taxi Driver"" or ""The Godfather"" and take films for what they are supposed to be, entertainment!!",figurative
"Had potential, the end was horrible I don't know maybe my review is tougher than others because I am a recovering addict I too was like Jackie except not a nurse everything else the same in the earlier seasons it's just so laughable. Made me wonder if anybody on the writing staff ever experienced drugs and their life. One Jackie bakes those weed cookies for the patient with cancer. If only it was so simple to throw some flour into your cookies and bake them and get high no your cookies would be burned to a crisp to get the weed high enough to release the THC. Mid-season the writing got better, more believable more realistic. Season 7 was beyond horrible I didn't think I was going to find a show with a worse season finale than How I met your mother. Season 7 could have won a completely different way but they they messed it up. I hate shows that don't have an ending that leave more questions than answers. And for a while there the show wasn't even about Jackie it was like she wasn't even there what's the point then. It should have been called nurse Zoe for that. And what's the point of giving Grace such a huge storyline and then just throwing her to the side. Getting rid of Cooper before the end of season 7 was just horrible decision making. They did Cooper so dirty. So how she takes suboxins and pills without getting sick is beyond me. She should have been throwing up having horrible withdrawal symptoms and need to go to the hospital and she did all that but no miraculously she has no repercussions for mixing those two pills. More research was definitely needed they should have consulted some recovering addicts. I've done the home health Care a bit, I've lost my stash because I hid it in a bad spot and lost it, I was the queen manipulator, I've done it all. I I read that they had a different idea for an ending where the hospital is burning and Jackie runs into the building to save a patient that's who Jackie is that would have been a better ending. No matter how bad Jackie was she was saving people to have her succumb that way it's just horrible. One thing that is very relatable besides the whole entire home health Care thing is when we lose our maintenance and we have to go find a different route that's when we start to spiral. We panic and we feel like we need more that we have to do anything and everything to make sure we stay that way which leads us to take more than we've ever taken and doing worse things to get to them. So as soon as that pics of machine went in she started to unravel because her constant flow is now gone. If you notice him up from like three sugar packets to get her through the day to needing a handfuls and more handfuls and more scheming and more lying and more throwing other people under the bus. That right there is real life. If we know we have something for tomorrow guaranteed or not going to spiral out we're not going to panic or we're not going to start hoarding and doing horrible horrible things. I have almost 4 years thanks to Suboxone. An FYI pill poppers we doze. Especially when benzos are involved. So please don't ever take this stuff to heart when you think you can diagnose somebody, she did not behave like a true addict side effect/high acts wise. Even after 20 years and taking like 200 mg a day I would doze off and fall asleep with the cigarette in my hand and almost catch my mom's couch on fire. That's realistic.",figurative
"Whatever happened to Gary Cooper, the strong silent type. On January 10th, 1999, a mobster walked in a psychiatrist's office, and the rest is history. I watched The Sopranos just recently, and the first thing that came to my mind after finishing that last episode was, ""why haven't I watched this earlier??"". I never underestimated this show, because I heard great stuff about it, but also bad stuff. And that's okay, because it is not a show for everyone. If you enjoy mafia movies, even on a small level, you are definitely going to enjoy this. If you don't enjoy mafia movies, then you're probably going to enjoy it anyway. The reason why I am comparing this to movies, is because it is a movie on some level. It is a cinematic show. Before The Sopranos, shows such as Friends, Seinfeld, etc, all shared the same thing. A 20 minute episode, they weren't necessarily connected to each other, but people still enjoyed them. Now The Sopranos, it has been said by many that it is basically a 13 hour movie. That is because each season has 13 episodes (except for the last one). I imagine what a challenge it must have been for David Chase (the creator) to get a television to pick the show up. Naturally, he got turned down. It would have been impossible for The Sopranos to be part of a network television. I believe that the limit in network tv, is about 42 minutes per episode (then you have the commercial breaks and other things). Luckily, HBO decided to put the show on the air. An episode is around 52-60 minutes, and it was this show, that put HBO on the map (later producing shows like Game of Thrones, Boardwalk Empire, Westworld etc). When the first episode aired in 1999, it started a new age of television. The viewers were introduced with the concept of an anti-hero, being the protagonist of the show. This shocked a lot of people, because they were used to seeing bad guys in movies, then getting killed at the end. Having said this, The Sopranos was immediately revolutionary. I imagine how people felt when watching it, thinking ""a show about a bad guy""? It was never done before... But after the first season, people realized that it was special, and the reason for that is because it was different, unique. The greatest thing about this show, except the story line and structure, I have to say that it is the casting. It is not one of those shows where the lead actors are good, and then the extras are there to just do the part. Every single person withing the shot, is so spot on. I have to give credit to David Chase, who I know pays a lot of attention to detail. It is crazy how you can't imagine other people playing those characters, and that is because no one could play them like the cast did. James Gandolfini's performance is probably the most powerful performance on TV. I have watched a lot of shows, and I have never seen such brilliant acting. I hate it when people compare his performance to Bryan Cranston's on Breaking Bad. Don't get me wrong, it is also one of the best performances, but you have to know that if it wasn't for The Sopranos, there wouldn't be Breaking Bad, or Walter White for that matter. The Sopranos opened the doors for many shows, such as Breaking Bad, Mad Men, etc. The other great thing about the show is the writing. Every character has its own arc. You can see how they develop during the show. Except for the anti-hero concept, I think that it was also the first show to introduce character development. There's something about how the characters are written. Just the main idea of the show, the professional and personal life of a mobster, struggling with his work and family, is brilliant. It treats subjects like illness, the importance of it, loyalty, love, trust, hatred, death, and many others. You see characters change, evolve, you start to like them, you start to dislike them. It is the best written show to this day. It is dark, witty, cynical, and most importantly, addictive. David Chase decided to do what no other director did before. He showed violence, drugs, sex, and other elements that no one thought of putting in television. It pioneered cinematic television, it took mental illness seriously, it changed how we watch TV. I am not reviewing the episodes and story line, because I don't want to spoil this masterpiece, but I have to say one more thing... Whatever you're doing, stop! This show is a necessity, something that you need to watch, so do it.",figurative
"A reset? More of the tired same thing It was supposed to be a reset or partial reboot (no origin story, thank god), a new direction for ""Superman"" and the DC Universe in general, but it turns out to be pretty much of the same old, tired superhero fare.

I fail to see major differences with your average Marvel flick: too many characters and superheroes waiting in the wings to get their own pic, too many story arcs that lead nowhere interesting (just wait for some future film though!), too much story basically. Lois Lane is a non entity and is barely glimpsed, whereas Jimmy gets way too much screen time for a storyline that is not exactly indispensable (his ex giving him intel). I guess Jimmy will be used to connect various films within the DCEU, but here that means sacrificing the core of the story: the relationship between Clark and Lois, and above all the doubts of Clark/Superman as an alien in a foreign land, which is handled in just a few rushed scenes. This should have been developed to give the film more emotional weight and dramatic import, but there's clearly no time because hey, we need to feature Green Lantern, Mister Terrific, etc.

I'm not saying anything new here, which goes to show that this new iteration of ""Superman"" is just another instance of a flick that is more a rushed episode in an ongoing saga that an actual movie with anything like substance. Nothing new under the Marvel/DC sun.",figurative
"It's no Peaky Blinders but some might enjoy it House of Guinness is a new show from Steven Knight (Peaky Blinders). It has that same look and feel as PB. It's about the Guinness family after its founder dies in 1868 and leaves its empire in the hands of his four children, each with problems and secrets of their own. It may start slow for some but stay with it because after the first couple episodes it really picks up. It's a good period series about power, greed, betrayal and back stabbing. Bottom line is while House of Guinness isn't nearly as good as PB, it's still a pretty good show that's worth watching.",literal
"Amazing, I wish there was more. Seven seasons just wasn't enough! I love the actors, I love the town and all of the people in it (Kirk is hilarious!) , I love absolutely everything about this show. I really wish they still made shows like this. I have to say, I binged this show in a shorter time period than I should have. I couldn't stop watching. This has to be my new favourite for sure. The characters and the development of each and everyone is beautifully written and each character couldn't have did a better job with their roles. If you're wondering what this show is like, It's comforting. I think everyone has a ""comfort"" show ... this is definitely mine!",literal
"Magnificent Been anticipating for a while it's so great and doesn't deserve hate maybe a little but it's mostly worth watching! Didn't expect horror already that was well done, unexpected great characters, smooth directing so far, and just really cool series that gets better as it goes on. I'm intrigued for more of Derry town it's glorious entertainment!",literal
"Hamnet: Rebirth in Love and Loss - My Viewing Anticipation Days ago at a film screening hosted by the Asia Society, I met a veteran Hollywood producer and Oscar voter. She excitedly brought up Chloé Zhao's new film Hamnet, asserting with confidence that it will walk away with two to four major Awards next year.

Almost at the same time, I saw my friend, educator Dr. Baiyan Yang, praising the film on social media: ""This not only proves Zhao's artistic mastery and humanistic depth, but also stands among the most emotionally powerful works of our time.""

With such ""preloaded"" expectations, I began to look into the details. Indeed, the film is scheduled for a limited U. S. release on November 27, while its Telluride Film Festival premiere has already set critics abuzz: a perfect 100% on Rotten Tomatoes, a stellar 95 on Metacritic. The Playlist even declared it ""another masterpiece from Zhao.""

Adapted from Maggie O'Farrell's acclaimed novel, Hamnet diverges from works that traditionally focus on Shakespeare's career, choosing instead to center on his wife Agnes (Jessie Buckley) and their young son who died prematurely. It portrays a family torn apart by plague yet striving for renewal. Zhao's documentary-like aesthetic and use of natural light make 16th-century rural England almost tangible-you can feel the dew on Agnes's fingertips and hear the sound of her breaking heart. The climax is especially moving: when she watches ""Hamlet"" performed at The Globe, the name of her lost child overlaps with the title character, and art fuses with life in a moment of profound poignancy.

Reports from the premiere noted many audience members were in tears. Critics called it ""the most devastating film in years,"" emphasizing that it not only depicts a family tragedy but also reframes the emotional roots of Shakespeare's Hamlet. Performances by Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal have been hailed as career-defining turns.

What intrigued me further was Zhao's own comment earlier this year. Reflecting on her Marvel experience with Eternals, she said it gave her insights into world-building, but Hamnet brought her back to the intimacy of contained storytelling: ""When resources are limited, everything becomes more meaningful."" That line has stayed with me.

From the heights of Nomadland, through the divisive reception of Eternals, and now to the triumphant acclaim of Hamnet, Zhao's work has always carried her signature: an empathy for outsiders, a reverence for nature and humanity, and a gift for transforming individual grief into universal emotion. In an era saturated with superhero blockbusters, a film with this kind of literary depth and emotional resonance feels like a breath of fresh air.

Personally, I am deeply looking forward to its official release in November. Hamnet is poised not only to be a heavyweight contender in awards season, but also to show us a director returning to her roots with greater maturity after navigating both commercial spectacle and intimate art. Perhaps this is what cinema ultimately exists for-to find rebirth in the fragile balance between love and loss.",figurative
"A Brilliant Blend of Education, Emotion, and Crime-Solving I absolutely loved High Potential! I'm a big fan of crime investigation series in general, but this one stands out as particularly educational. Morgan shares fascinating and curious facts throughout the episodes, which enhance the experience without feeling overwhelming or unnecessary. Instead, they leave you amazed at every little detail.

Additionally, the series does a fantastic job of showcasing Morgan's charisma while also diving deep into her personal struggles. It explores her existential crisis as someone with a brilliant mind, as well as the challenges she faces as a mother. You can really feel how much she cares for her children and fights to respect their privacy while trying to protect and support them.",literal
"Finally, a Show that stays true to it's written roots As an avid reader, I am often disappointed by what is represented by the silver screen. I initially get excited to see one of my favorite series on the big screen, and eventually walk away disgusted. For whatever reason, most shows and movies that are based on epic book series absolutely butcher the original content. 

So when I saw the preview for ""Game of Thrones"" on HBO, I was immediately skeptical. Oh, I was going to watch it, but I didn't have high expectations. I did hold a little hope because HBO is known for their high quality shows. 

I was absolutely shocked to watch the Pilot and realize that it followed the book almost to perfection. The language that is used by the actors is very similar to the way that it was written in the book, and events were not skipped. It stayed very true to the story without adding to it or removing from it. 

The acting is superb and I actually felt like I was looking into Winterfell for the first time. I feel like I've actually got faces to add to the characters that I've been reading about for a long time. 

If you have not read the books, you may feel as though the blatant sexuality is an addition from HBO to add some spice to the series. This is not the case at all. The books contained all of the sexuality that is shown in the Pilot. I am very proud of HBO for producing an amazingly accurate product. I will be watching every week for sure. 

If you enjoyed what you saw in the Pilot, know that there are many other plot twists and action filled evenings to come. ""Game of Thrones"" has a ton of potential to be one of the greatest series that has ever been produced. I would highly recommend it to fans of the series and newcomers alike.

UPDATE:

I have now watched 3 Episodes and I wanted to come back and report some more. Even after 3 Episodes, the series is staying true to the written story. Overall the acting is still very good. I hate to watch a show that makes it look like the actors are reading a script. I don't get this impression with this HBO adaptation. 

Each episode of this series leaves me itching for the next weekend. I really hate watching shows in real time because I enjoy absorbing several hours of a show at one time. But, a good show will keep you looking forward to it the whole week. 

A special note to viewers that have not read the books... Keep watching! This series has numerous twists and turns and full of epic battles and action. It may seem like it's taking a little while to develop, but the reward is well worth the wait. 

Even after 3 episodes, I would still highly recommend this to anyone.",literal
"Works Best When at Its Wackiest Few will likely take issue with the notion that ""Crime doesn't pay."" And that idea rings even more true if restated as ""Crime doesn't pay if you're a nice guy."" That's one of the truths that emerges loud and clear in this fact-based comedy-drama about soldier-turned-thief Jeffrey Manchester (Channing Tatum), who had trouble finding his way (and making ends meet) after leaving the military. Set in North Carolina in 2004, this young husband and father is greatly troubled by his inability to adequately provide for his family. His solution is to turn to a life of crime, specifically drawing on his uncanny knack for being able to spot details in opportunities and exploit them to his advantage. He specifically targets fast food restaurants, gaining access by breaking through the roofs of these businesses and dropping in to swipe whatever cash is on hand, generally just before they open for the day. He treats the skeleton crews typically on duty at that time with his signature polite, apologetic courtesy and kindness before stealthily making off with the loot. His stash adds up quickly and substantially - that is, until one time when he's caught, convicted and thrown into prison. But that proves to be a mere detour, promptly escaping and going on the run, skillfully taking refuge behind the scenes in a Toys 'R' Us store. However, his stay turns out to be longer than anticipated, and, with that kind of time on his hands and a natural inclination to want to be helpful to others in need, he unwittingly becomes distracted. This leaves him vulnerable to being discovered and recaptured, especially when his Samaritan side surfaces in doing right by others. That's especially true when he takes a liking to Leigh Wainscott (Kirsten Dunst), a genial but challenged single mother of two who works at the store and who falls hard for his charms, unaware of who he really is. Can Jeffrey keep up the ruse? Or will he fall victim to his naturally compassionate and generous tendencies? As endearing as this crowd-pleasing story might sound, though, it's somewhat uneven (and at times innocuous) in its execution. For instance, it's difficult to fathom how someone so allegedly nice could simultaneously be capable of such dubious behavior (especially when viewers never really get to find out how he got that way). Then there's the film's tendency to downplay the seriousness of the protagonist's actions in light of the picture's predominantly frothy narrative. And the love interest story thread - no matter how charming it might be at times - is given too much weight in the overall flow of the movie. With that said, though, there are definite strengths present here, too, particularly in this offering's depiction of a hardened criminal hiding out in the whimsical environment of a toy store, the aspect of the film that truly works best (and should have received greater focus). The wacky juxtaposition of these disparate elements evokes many hearty laughs, especially in the segments where the protagonist must inventively look for ways to keep from being found out, most notably by the facility's surly store manager, Mitch (Peter Dinklage). In all, though, while ""Roofman"" makes for a modestly entertaining diversion, it would have fared better by playing to its strengths more and scaling back the less engaging romantic subplot, sequences that tend to slow the pacing and detract from what actually works best. Indeed, try as writer-director Derek Cianfrance might, there's simply no getting away with that.",figurative
"You couldn't screw it up more if you actively tried Season 3 ended on such a whimper. I stuck with it to see out Henry Cavill, but he was barely present in the last two episodes. The show stopped being a Witcher story long ago unfortunately. Expertly portrayed by Henry Cavill, he embodied everything about Geralt exactly how you'd expect a fan of the lore to do so, yet he continuously found himself in someone else's story and not his own. Too few Witcher quests from the get-go, but Season 1 at least still had more Witcher adventures and nods to the source material, but you can clearly see it being stripped away more and more in the subsequent seasons and why Cavill left. Season 3 culminating in a chore to get to the end with increasingly poor writing as the show runners strayed more into their 'creativity'; Vilgefortz being bad all along was baseless and cheap, Tissaia's powerful ""last-resort"" spell accomplishing nothing and being blocked by a simple shield spell, Tissaia - established as a strong leader- killing herself at the exact moment a strong leader is needed utterly out of character and devoid of reason, badass girl power characters that didn't exist before suddenly shoe-horned in and springing up everywhere with no introduction or buildup, the fake Ciri conveniently captured instead of the real one (where was she picked up? How did she find herself there? Don't know!)...goodness you could go on.

It's rare to be able to cast a lead in a fantasy series that's as invested and knowledgeable in your source material as Cavill was, to be able to lend you authenticity and passion. To have a wealth of untapped source material laying it all out for you, a blueprint there for the taking, and to fumble it so impressively is staggering. Shame on them.

I rather enjoyed Yen as well though. Her and Geralt's dynamic felt accurate, especially early on but her role was obviously artificially ballooned more and more as the show went on. Joey Batey also enjoyable as Jaskier for comic relief but he also should've been used more sparingly in later seasons. At it's core this should've stayed a Witcher story.

It feels a shame to give the show a 6 for how good Cavill was in his role but I'm afraid it's a holistic reflection (and probably a generous one) I'll average from the 3 seasons: Season 1: 8/10 Season 2: 7/10 Season 3: 3/10.",figurative
Marathon after first episode I had plans for today being my day off and that all went to hell after watching the first episode. Gary Oldman is great and never seems to peak with each new project. His supporting cast hold their own with the best of them. Great spy story that's not dry and typical but has a real human element from all the characters. Good and bad.,literal

But they deserve our applause. Thanks.",literal
"Ted Danson is the only reason to watch. ""A Man on the Inside"" is a Netflix series that, while charming, leans heavily on Ted Danson's magnetic allure to mask its narrative shortcomings. Set in an upscale San Francisco retirement home, the show follows Charles (Danson), an ex-professor turned undercover ""spy"" tasked with finding a valuable family heirloom for a detective agency led by a woman young enough to be his daughter. In a somewhat contrived setup, she poses as his daughter to infiltrate the home with him.

Their dynamic is marred by age-related condescension, which feels weak. Moreover, Charles's relationship with his actual daughter is strained, reaching a boiling point when she learns of his undercover antics.

His involvement in this mystery is deeply intertwined with his recent bereavement from losing his wife to dementia, adding a poignant layer to his interactions with residents who share her condition.

The series introduces a wide cast including residents, staff, and relatives, yet many of these characters' stories feel like padding, more suited to filling out the runtime over eight episodes than advancing the core narrative.

From the beginning, there are clear hints towards the 'memory care' unit, suggesting it's pivotal to the mystery. This unit, with its restricted access, becomes central to the intrigue, but Charles's hesitation to explore it seems forced, serving only to prolong the unfolding of the mystery.

Despite these narrative hiccups, ""A Man on the Inside"" finds its strength in moments of genuine warmth and introspection, largely thanks to Danson's compelling and comedic performance. His portrayal acts as the emotional anchor, maintaining viewer interest even as the storyline occasionally drifts. The series examines themes of loneliness, friendship, and new beginnings in later life, delivering a comforting, though predictable, narrative. It could have used tighter writing and a more profound exploration of its themes, particularly around the 'memory care' unit and Charles's personal loss, but it nonetheless reminds us of the importance of human connection across all ages, making it watchable primarily due to its star. (which is how it even earned a 5)",literal
"Story is interesting, but... All points are for the story and cast, other than Claire Danes. Matthew Rhys is great and the others too.

However, Claire Danes' constant trembling lower lip and jaw is so over the top. She's always on the verge of crying and it's so fake. I almost stopped watching due to the annoying over-acting. I have liked her in other series, but this was a fail.",literal
"A great new comedy series This one's a touchdown.

Comedy is hard, but this one works. Funny characters, with good dialogue. Cinematography with great colors, photography that you can enjoy, and with real acting. And... no brown/blue color coding, with dull lighting.

Everyone in this series is playing a character that in the context of the story is serious and believable, and it was a long time since I saw that in a new series.

It also respect the viewer and don't force any morals or preaching down the viewers throat. Thank you for that. For once I want more!",literal
"Review for The Long Walk Now this is a film that I was excited about when I heard it was being made. I was also leery. I originally read this in high school and then gave it another go more recently. The concept is simple enough, but it is terrifying. It also doesn't feel like we're that far from elements that are used. I was able to see this on the opening day at the Gateway Film Center.

Synopsis: in a dystopian, alternative-America ruled by a totalitarian regime, a group of teenage boys compete in an annual contest known as 'The Long Walk', where they must maintain a certain walking speed or be executed, until only one survivor remains.

We start this with the letter that our lead character received, informing him that he's been selected for this year's event. His name is Raymond Garraty (Cooper Hoffman). His mother, Ginnie (Judy Greer), is dropping him off. We can see that she's visibly upset and wants him to change his mind. He tells her that he cannot do that. It's too late.

After she leaves him, he meets others that are participating. He befriends Peter McVries (David Jonsson) quickly. They also make a group as they walk with Arthur Baker (Tut Nyuot) and Hank Olson (Ben Wang). There are others that they butt heads with like Gary Barkovitch (Charlie Plummer), who seems to like to push buttons. There's also the favorite, Stebbins (Garrett Wareing).

A little more backstory for this event. One male from each state is selected. It is claimed to be voluntary, but as the guys figure out, most everyone signs up. The goal is to be the last one left. If you win, you are given money and one wish. You must maintain a speed of three miles per hour. If you fall below that, you are given a warning. You can get three of these at a time until you're executed. If you walk for an hour, you remove a warning. Also, if you step off the road, that's an automatic killing. This 'game' is run by The Major (Mark Hamill).

The event then starts and we see different strategies. You are to never stop. They walk throughout the night and continue on until there's the last person. This includes no bathroom breaks. They are given food daily and water canteens when needed. They are given numbers, to easily identify them. We see Barkovitch get a rock in his shoe and need to get it out. He's given three warnings in the process. He also messes with Rank (Daymon Wrightly), which bothers the rest of the group with the result.

We then see what happens the longer everyone goes. Some people break down early and are taken out. Others go much longer. Regardless, it is a toll both physically and mentally. We also learn more about the motivations to do this and the state of the world that would allow something as barbaric as this, considering it is televised.

That is where I'll leave my recap and introduction to the characters. Where I'll start is that this film has basic premises. We know that its set in the near future. There isn't much difference in the way technology. What is impressive is that this was written back in the 1970s and it still translates well to a modern audience. If anything, we're back in the state of the world where it is terrifyingly possible that something like this could be enacted. A bit more background is that a civil war happened and it seems a fascist government is now in control. It feels very Orwellian.

Now that I've set that up a bit more, this is definitely more of a character study. First and foremost, of our lead characters, Garraty and McVries. As we progress, we learn more about the other characters. If you just think about the concept, it would be boring. The characters are walking at a good pace, but it's not fast. It's about endurance and how long your body can hold up. Decisions made also wear on characters mentally or just breaking down from exhaustion. Seeing that effect and the parts that we learn helped me connect. It made me care about what would happen to them.

Garraty and McVries, despite vastly different pasts, grow close during the competition. Garraty, from a good upbringing, unknowingly mirrors his father's mistakes, while McVries' difficult past has given him a unique appreciation for life. I want to give credit to Hoffman and Jonsson for what they brought to their characters to bring them to life. Both do an excellent job.

Something else to bring up is that JT Mollner, our writer, does a subtle job at introducing this world without being too in your face with the commentary. We learn that William Garraty (Josh Hamilton) was punished for showing forbidden art to his son. This is an interesting look at censorship. This feels borrowed from George Orwell's '1984'. Something else is that there was a war that left the country in financial ruin, hence this game was started to not only thin out numbers but to inspire the nation. It is a morbid thing to think due to what happens to the 'losers'.

Let's then shift over to discuss the filmmaking aspects. The cinematography and framing excel at capturing the game's bleak Midwestern setting, which is drab, flat, and lacks color. The demoralizing rain and director Francis Lawrence's brutal, realistic portrayal of competitors' deaths (likely a mix of practical and CGI effects) are well-done. The effective sound design and fitting music enhances the tone and atmosphere.

All that is left then would be the acting performances. Hoffman and Jonsson lead a cast, including Wareing, Nyuot, Wang, and Plummer, who all deliver distinct and impressive performances. Greer excels as the conflicted mother, a role that resonated deeply. Hamilton's flashbacks effectively develop Garraty. Hamill is excellent as the stoic, villainous major. Overall, the acting is superb.

In conclusion, this successfully translates Richard Bachman's (Stephen King's) chilling vision to the screen, delivering a thought-provoking and emotionally resonant experience. While its simple premise could have been monotonous, the film thrives as a character study, bolstered by strong performances from Hoffman and Jonsson, who anchor the narrative with their compelling portrayal of friendship amidst desperation. Mollner's subtle writing, Lawrence's stark direction and expert technical execution creates a world that feels terrifyingly plausible. Hamill's villainous turn as The Major further solidifies this adaptation as a powerful and impactful cinematic achievement.

My Rating: 8.5 out of 10.",literal
"Hollywood weapon non-retention Never have so many weapons been dropped so many times in a single series. Every time they desperately need their weapons their hands seem to simply open up and drop them as if on cue. Hollywood weapons retention has never been a mainstay with script and screenplay writers; but this series takes weapons dropping to new highs. It has become one of the most expected, and predictable, parts of every episode.

Other than the predictable throwing down of their weapons every time they get tackled, pushed, or hit it's a really good series. Well acted and well written - with the exceptions listed above - it keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering what the next plot twist will be. Recommended for your watching pleasure if you are into mild horror, fantasy films, and shoot-'em-ups.",literal
"A story worth telling I admittedly knew absolutely nothing about Garfield, and definitely didn't know the name of his assassin. And the manner he was elected in - so strange. Could you imagine that happening today?

Love the actors, they absolutely nailed it. Shannon and Offerman are two of my favorites, so no surprises there. Plus, rare for a Netflix limited series, it's not loaded with filler.

So why not higher? The last episode in particular got a little under my skin for two reasons. Firstly, the 'Freedmans doctor' they injected, not just on the scene but as an out of place patronizing figure moments later during surgery. Record of him exists, but pretty much everything else is conjecture. And the last doctor, who chastised the main doctor, likely didn't exist at all, as this theory wasn't considered until much later.

I get what they were going for with the last doctor, but that wasn't known at the time and was only claimed later. This made his real doctor seem like an old quack, which wasn't exactly the case, as he was widely respected at the time(though we know now he wasn't right).

Such things would have been better as part of the epilogue than hamfisted into the movie.

Also, Conkling is shown as pretty evil, and maybe he was...but he was actually more on the side of civil liberties and freedman than the other side, which is a bit misrepresented.

Small details, but if they inserted all these liberties into that part, it made me question how many others they did prior.",literal
Riddled with Lazy Clichés Absolutely no research was conducted by the writers of this annoying cliche of a script. Be prepared to suspend all belief of just about every aspect of this Lazy let's watch some similar stuff and copy as much as we can.

"Not your usual animation. To really appreciate this series you need to know couple of things.

1. Author of this series originally drew this series in order to learn new manga drawing software he purchased. So you will see lot of silly and or in some cases stupid things, but as he went series got more and more popular and ended up being a one of the most popular anime/manga in the japan.

2. There is two version of manga one is made by original author and other one is illustrated by professional manga artist. So there is big gap between the two. You see, more serious Saitama was a creation of second artist and humorous, silly face of Saitama was created by original author, so both of them ended up mashing their talent and artistic sense to create one of the kind anime we see today.",literal

"The unexpected hit of the year This film is something special, and is an unexpected hit of a film, specifically to me. Before all the hype began, all I had to go off of was the title and the constant pushes from Netflix to view their new original film, and I was very hesitant. Movies of this type, that being musical, monster slaying, emotional movies, have a tendency of being not very good, and not worth the time. That was before I learned Sony was behind this. This film brings in a fun to watch animation style, similar of that of 'the Mitchell's vs. The machines' combined with a plot and world that was decently built, and with strong leads and great characters that allows for this film to be a great watch for everyone. All movie viewers, regardless of taste, could probably find something from this movie they could like if they tried, and not all movies can do that. Overall, a great watch, and I have a new song album to save to my library.",literal

"Family Affair No pun intended - seeing the cast I kind of expected to be served something good ... I just was not prepared how good it would be in the end (well and in between - so no pun intended).

Imdb has the generated text from reviews ... and the list it has for this movie ... well quite apt to say the least. They seem to get it right for most movies - yes you may have issues to keep or check every little box ... you could for example also mention set design for this one .... it works in the end (and elsewhere).

The movie also sticks with the characters - you get the moments where other movies cut away... this movie is uncomfortable ... we are supposed to feel the pain and anxiety ... and with actors who convey every emotion they want us to feel by ""simple"" looks ... well what more can you say and praise the movie? This is as rhetorical as it can get.

The emotional weight is heavy ... and yet there are many light moments ... a dysfunctional family if there ever was one .. one of the daughters seemingly never got over her treatment as a kid ... and the childhood wasn't an easy one. Though of course there are worse fates - still a kid never thinks like that.

Every performance, every minute (and you never can feel how long the movie is - two hours plus) ... well designed and well done - very likely in my movies of the year list! But of course not everyones cup of tea ... you have to love it.",literal
"The lead annoys but intriguing start I love this kind of show and the first two episodes were well crafted and intriguing - on the whole. There was a lot of humour and the collective 'hive mind' idea is intriguing and something I'm sure we'll explore further. But, at two episodes in, how is the infuriating lead character simply shouting angrily rather than asking ANY actual questions? It's crazy to think all other humans are taken over by ...something and you don't have a single query about what the something might be, where it's come from, why etc etc.",literal
"I'm not mad, just disappointed I honestly didn't expect much from this third movie, but I was still disappointed.

"Slow burn, but not for me. I've watched this movie alone in cinema. I'm not expecting anything at all. But the movie delivered interesting plot and great acting from lead but it quite not brought that exciting part I kind of thought it needed. It was really cinematic but not engaging. I don't know but critic's review is somewhat different to public viewing's opinion about it. I managed to finish the movie and not leaving even though some viewers at the cinema already left just not half of the movie was over. But the movie for me, tackled depression and the state of coping about loss. It was average, but not for me on the first watch. Maybe on the second watch it'll grow and will also unravel some keys to my questions but indeed this movie is really not for everyone.",literal

"Caricature Well this could have been awesome and both Jude Law and Jason Bateman are essentially great actors but I didn't believe that they are brothers and I couldn't feel Jake's alleged dependency on his brother either. Now Bateman was amazing in Ozark but in this series Vince becomes a mere caricature of a hopeless man and you never feel an ounce of sympathy for him, and thus can't connect with him, a huge shame. And speaking of caricature the two nitwits who are haunting the brothers also act like cliché lowlife criminals we have seen far too often. Lastly, I feel that too much focus is put on characters such as Jake's love interest who by the way is miscast and uninteresting.

A lot of potential somewhat thrown away!",literal
Nothing like the book! This movie sucks it's nothing like the book at all I was excited to hear the my favorite Stephen king book has a movie adaptation but I was disappointed because the movie sucks! Even if you haven't read the book the movie is still bad just don't watch. Arnold Schwarzenegger isn't a good role for Ben Richards. In the book Ben is not a masculine male that went to prison he's a average guy that has to pay for his daughter medication but can't afford it so he has to go on the game show the running man.

"Is this tragedy all in the mind? The story of the mental disintegration of a young writer and married woman called Grace who has recently given birth. Set in Montana (but filmed in Alberta) director Lynne Ramsay's 2025 feature film is an adaptation of Ariana Harwicz's novel 'Die, My Love', and is a visceral, emotional, unpredictable psychological drama with a mysterious indefinable element to the mental malady that Grace suffers from. Featuring a good strong central performance from Jennifer Lawrence, it leaves things ambiguous over the cause of her mental illness - postnatal depression, despair, isolation, boredom, neglect, dissatisfaction, sexual frustration, writer's block, tiredness with life, or maybe a mixture of these things? Whatever it is the cries for help go unrecognised or appear to be dealt with in the wrong way (commitment to a mental health institute is followed shortly after by a tragic climax) and the attempts at romantic escapism and excitement (in the shape of a fantasy black biker), and prowling around like a cat, don't work. Are the causes leading to the tragedy all in the mind?",literal
A good ride from start to finish This movie was extremely gripping and very scary at times but dont go in expecting the best movie ever just settle in with what the movie gives you and let it take over . Me and my dad both really enjoyed this and it is a slower ride but it was worth the watch and definitely worth a watch in the theater.,literal
"Giving it a ""1"" was charity I can't understand what earned this series awards. I only finished all the episodes because my partner wanted to thinking, it's going to get so much better it won a lot of Emmy awards. Well it didn't.

Here is what I didn't like about it;


* It wasn't funny. I didn't laugh even once at anything.



* None of the characters were likable except for Robert.



* It was so predictable.



* The ending wasn't surprising and very unoriginal. It has been done so many times before.



* The performances of all the actors was overdone and ridiculous, but not funny. Not in the least. I really didn't care what happened to any of them because I was not invested at all. Have can you possibly like these people? They were all so shallow.


I wish I could say something positive about this series to validate the 1 star but honestly, there was absolutely nothing I liked about it. Needless to say, I will not be watching season 2. I wish I had stopped watching season 1 after episode 2.",literal
"TOPICALLY FUNNY...? An amiable comedy from Aziz Ansari (Netflix' Master of None) currently in theaters about a poor schlub, essayed by Ansari, who works at several dead end jobs (he works at a task rabbit concern) when things start to go into the crapper prompting a lower tier angel, played winningly by Keanu Reeves, decides to change his circumstances by switching Ansari w/a successful businessman, Seth Rogen, & see where things go which works out wonderfully for Ansari but Rogen, not so much. This comic conceit plays out wonderfully & Ansari smartly makes this particular meal a nuanced one where the uneasy edges of the narrative unfortunately mirrors today's workforce a bit too closely but don't the best satires hold a grain of truth just waiting to be mocked?",literal
"My expectations were too high? The antagonist reveal is the moment the film lost me. There's some really cool scenes in this movie for sure but overall I'm not satisfied.

When the witch initially came on screen she was very unsettling! I was expecting a much more gruesome and horrid individual under the over the top makeup and wig. But no it was just a regular old lady with cancer. And then when they revealed how the ""possessions"" worked in the 3rd act, that's really when I checked out. I have a second viewing in a few hours and I'm honestly thinking about canceling.

The move is paced like a TV show instead of a movie. Not a good or bad thing just an observation. This definitely could have been a very cool mini-series! There's alot of side plots and characters that would have been fun to see flushed out. For example, Josh Brolin's character takes matters into his own hands to find his kid, and he makes his own family and others very uncomfortable by doing so. It led to some hard tension in a few scenes. That's just one example.

Damn now that I'm thinking about it, I really wish this was a mini-series.",literal
"Decent Movie Rating - 6.3: Overall, it's nice to see Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan back together because their dynamic still makes this movie fun and worth watching, but this is literally a Gen Z remake of the first movie that's just a little too freaky this time around; even though it does have its issues, I really do hope Lohan can parlay this into a full comeback because she was stunning in this movie and really makes these types of comedies work.

Direction - Decent: The direction on a macroscale is very Gen Z and pretty safe, basically if the original movie was made today; the direction on a microscale is surprisingly good as it is carried by the chemistry of the cast, especially the two leads; the storytelling is pretty bland because it is literally the same movie as the first, though it does touch on different familial topics

Story - Decent: The concept is literally the same as the first movie, except that it's even freakier; if the first movie was very early 2000s, this one is very Gen Z; the plot structure is linear and simple considering it's the exact same movie as the first; character writing is pretty good as you relate to and cheer for these characters, especially the main two returning, because it paints depth that shows the insecurities they are going through

Screenplay - Pretty Bad to Decent: The dialogue is pretty cringey and Gen Z, but still entertaining; The humor misses a good amount because of how cringey it is, but it does hit at times and is still enjoyable; The symbolism is deeper than the first as it touches on a lot of topics of loss, family, and parenthood; The foreshadowing gives the movie away considering this is a Disney movie and it is literally the same as the first

Acting - Pretty Good: Jamie Lee Curtis - Good (Picks up where she left off, as her chemistry with Lohan really makes this movie, as both are two halves to an entertaining duo that makes this movie fun and interesting), Lindsay Lohan - Good (Picks up where she left off, as her chemistry with Curtis really makes this movie, as both are two halves to an entertaining duo that makes this movie fun and interesting; I really hope she can parlay this into a full comeback because she was stunning in this movie and really makes these types of comedies work), Julia Butters - Pretty Good to Good (Plays the younger daughter character well, and I can see promise in her future, as her screen presence is mature despite her age), Sophia Hammons - Pretty Good, Manny Jacinto - Pretty Good, Rest of the cast - Decent (Generic background DCOM-style actors, what you would expect from a movie like this)

Score - Decent: Light and upbeat, what you would expect from a Disney movie;

Soundtrack - Pretty Bad: Pretty tone-deaf, as it's very much executives being like, ""How do you do, fellow kids""

Cinematography - Decent

Editing - Decent: Pretty Gen Z-style editing; safe for the most part

Sound - Decent

Costumes - Pretty Good: enjoyed the costumes as they gave the characters flair and style

Pacing - Pacing is a little bit slower as it is longer than the first movie, but it is still fine for the most part

Climax - Climax is heartwarming and fun, making the movie entertaining and worth watching;

Tone - Tone is still very much a DCOM with a big budget; if the first movie was very Early 2000s, this is every Gen Z.",literal
"Ecstatically hovering between worlds This was a smash apparently. The first thing to note is that it's part of a newer crop of black films that examine black experience in different guises and contexts, venturing in search outside the narrow scope of 'hood' or inner city like older counterparts did.

There are two films here. One is about African American life, the fabric used is 1930s Mississippi, so the heartland of historic oppression. For the flmmaker this becomes an opportunity to explore various emblematic images; the cotton field, sharecropping in the wooden shed, blues music. There's the contrast, deliberate of course, between 'uppity' Chicago blacks and their more meek relatives down home.

Familiar tropes, but they are also presented with a whiff of stultifying Tarantino-ism; being content with stylized stereotype. The cocksure brothers from Chicago are shown in a Superfly light reminiscent of black movies from the 70s (incidentally bootleggers rather than drug dealers), the first crop to lionize stereotype as a way of reclaiming narrative agency in the world of oppression.

But this all here for us to also acquire weight and gravitas for the ensuing horror film, real world grounding.

The other film is the horror one where black experience of community summons white vampires from the night.

It's actually a bit different than that; the white vampires are shown as Irish, rather than local Southerners, the Irish at one time being maybe just a rung up from black people in the ladder of racism and mistreatment. They're also portrayed as representing a kind of assimilatory hive mind; rather than hatred of black people. Actual Klansmembers will later show up fr that.

The most rousing sequence here involves black people, away from oppressive whites, experiencing a night of orgiastic autonomy in a secluded makeshift honky tonk. Tied to music, the camera pans around the room with future black consciousness (electric blues, hip hop) being summoned for the occassion. And that's followed by an equally ecstatic Irish jig out in the night.

It's more ambitious than the filmmakers were actually able to execute I think, but I'll gladly take the roaming eye that ecstatically hovers between worlds rather than the short-term satisfaction of Tarantino-isms like gunning down hateful Klansmen.

I can somwhat wistfully imagine the black audience entering a kind of mystical communion with their fabric of shared experience.",literal
"A light crime series with Stallone Finally, Sylvester Stallone is in the right place, and more importantly, in the series. He as a persona, very suitable for such a series and a character in the series. But it's not all that smooth.

The series, which is its main very good plus, is light. Though it has some good action going on in places, it is easy to watch. The main characters are well delineated and visually memorable (but not the names). A topical and modern comedy that can't be called very funny, but makes you chuckle.

At times there is strange acting and incomprehensible character motivation, especially one of the characters. The plot is uncomplicated and quite ordinary with its variations, which does not make it stand out among other similar shows besides Stallone.

Although the series on season 1 and has no particular flaws, but I personally have a feeling that the series will roll because of the lack of ideas and poor further implementation, but I hope I'll be wrong. After watching season 1, I can say that it's a good, light, dramatic crime to watch.

UPD: As expected, season 2 has got worse. Sometimes a bit strange to listen to the music songs that the music editor picked up. Season 2 seemed to have less action and the action is stretched out. A lot of different not the most interesting dialogs. In general, it became less interesting. I guess season 3 or at most season 4, if they want to stretch it, will be the last one, as the creators will not be able to come up with anything to improve the series and keep viewers.",literal
"Goofy and funny 80's satire This is an Arnold movie. Now that you know that, I've saved a lot of you the time it would have taken to read this review. If you don't like Arnold, then you wont like this movie. If the case is the other, then you will very probably like it. It's as simple as that.

Now, if you're still reading this I expect you like Arnold. Good for you! He is quite good isn't he. The Running Man is a very typical Arnold feature. It's got the usual retro-future we know so well from 80's B-Sci Fi, it's got a bunch of terrible one-liners, lots of violence and explosions, and a good-looking heroine and a happy ending.

In this case, the evil opponent is the all-controlling 1984ish government, which uses television as an effective crowd-control with gladiator-type game shows. Arnold, of course, ends up in one of these shows and turns it all up-side-down, with a little help from his two confederates and the good-looking Amber.

It's not a big budget movie, but it still managed to create a pretty good atmosphere of the future, with some nice matte paintings and sets to help it. It's hopelessly 80's, but I find that charming. Acting is varying, Arnold doing his usual grunt and shout thing, with a helping of stone-faced one-liners. Heroine Amber is, to put it lightly, a bit stereotypical, and the subtly named Damen Killian is a typical evil TV man.

In spite of all it's flaws, the movie shows its message very clearly; television is an opiate of the masses, a good way to control people. It also features some at the time futuristic digital video editing, allowing the bad guys to change faces in a video to fool their audience. This does not seem futuristic at all today, which is a bit alarming.

If you've seen Arnold movies before then you know when to watch this one. Enjoy.",literal
"Animal Kingdom is FANTASTIC! I was trying to watch a 7 minute video on Youtube today when they hit me with a 60 minute commercial! Since that's how they make money, I sit through most reasonable length commercials, but 60 minutes?? That's nutz!

I was just about to turn it off but the look was different, there was no one shouting about brighter shirts and whiter teeth. Credits flashed on screen, ""Ellen Barkin""? ""Scott Speedman""? What IS this I thought, and I kept watching. Shawn Hatosy was even in it! Whenever he came on screen I'd shout ""Dunphy!"" ( I LOVED his film ""Outside Providence"" ) It was great to see him working.

After I watched the whole thing, I thought I'd just seen the most fantastic, top secret short film ever! I had to go on the net for more information about it.

It turned out that it was the first episode of a new TV series!

This is going to be BIG!",literal
"Dumbfounded by the rating! I'm just dumbfounded by the 7.9 rating for this show. Don't get me wrong, I love Kaitlyn and some of the rest of the cast. But this is a TERRIBLE show. Derivative, predictable, and just plain stupid are the qualities I use to describe this. Like most network shows, this is a spoon fed pile of garbage that is made for people who don't understand how to think for themselves. They NEED to be spoon fed plotlines and story arcs. I'm appalled that this country is so uneducated as to fall for this type of show. The dialog is just terrible. The acting is so sub-par I don't think any one of these actors would actually be cast if this wasn't a network show. Skip this at all costs unless you want to waste an hour of your life you'll never get back.",literal
"Seriously? Ten years of following Chicago Fire characters to get this disappointment. Removing Casey to show Stella's career? Joke? On top of that, her relationship with Severid. After all, she is not in his league. Keeping Stella in the foreground has already become disgusting and tiring. I propose to change the name to Stella Kidd Fire and her life dramas. I like series related to rescue, but in Chicago Fire too much time is devoted to romance and relationships at work. Placing Herrmann as a lieutenant in Cart 51 was surely a hit and it would be good to stick to that in the plot. At least leave that alone.",literal

"Roller coaster ride This series from start to end feels like a roller coaster ride and it's also highly addictive. Great acting and each episode is suspenseful like hell. I'd even give it a 10 - but I feel I should rate the entire series here, so I have to cut 2 stars only for the final season.

Not that season 6 is bad or lame like many other final seasons of great series are, this is really not the case. But these flashback jumps every 5 minutes are more irritating for the viewer than it adds value to the story. They better should have made a whole flashback episode instead.

Actually that's all I have to say about this series but unfortunately more characters are required for a review. I personally wish most reviews were shorter and that's why I usually ignore very large reviews.",figurative

"Cage in a rage Fast and Furious director and star (Rob Cohen and Vin Diesel) reunite to take on the world of espionage.

From an early moment we see a spy infiltrate enemy territory and then reveals himself in a tuxedo. The spy is soon out of sorts when he has to blend in during a metal concert.

Blending in as the new century arrives is not a problem for Xander Cage. A big muscular, tattooed extreme sports addict. He has been recruited by Samuel Jackson doing an early Nick Fury impersonation to go on a mission and do his bit for the Stars and Stripes.

The plot involves renegade Russian anarchists who want to destroy major cities by way of biological weapons and install a new world order. The group has already been infiltrated by Russian agents and unite with xXx to take out the bad guys and weapon.

The plot is indeed pure James Bond with its European setting but Diesel does not cut it as a super-spy. Extreme sports addicts might enjoy Diesel trying to out ski an avalanche.

The film is also too long, it needed to be tighter, the bad guys are unmemorable and as the years since this film has shown. Bond is still the name you know as Diesel bailed out for the sequel.",literal
"One of the BEST sitcoms ever 10 stars for all the Steve Carell seasons. Carell is HILARIOUS as the lovable, entertaining, idiotic Michael Scott.

Ain't no other mockumentary sitcom can top The Office. A modern sitcom classic.",literal
"This show is too weak I was expecting more after seeing the high ratings. It really does feel like a mixture of other series and movies (X-Men, Harry Potter, Scooby Doo and any generic high school teen dramas). It doesn't really have an Addams Family vibe despite having all the characters there.

The dialog isn't witty enough. The CGI is bad (the main monster is laughable). The acting is questionable especially Catherine Zeta Jones's. Wednesday is kind of okay-ish but she shows way too much emotion. It is not enough to tell that you don't care you have to show it, too! The blond roommate is simply annoying.

It has some funny moments and some good music but I don't think I could honestly recommend this to watch to anyone.",literal
"Take the boat, Georgie! The brand new #ITMovie scared the heck out of me and I don't throw that around loosely because just when you thought that ""Annabelle: Creation"" may have set the bar for this year, bam! ""IT"" comes along and smashes that bar into pieces. Wow! This is one incredible horror film, everybody involved should get a congratulatory pat on the back, definitely a huge upgrade from the '90s miniseries. This is best Stephen king adaptation yet.

Directed by Andy Muschietti, based on Stephen King's timeless novel of the same name, IT is set around the mysterious disappearance of children in Derry Maine, when a group of young kids will have to come face their biggest fears and square off against an eternal evil clown named Pennywise who comes around every 27 years to repeat his reign of terror. 

It's no secret and it's not really a spoiler that New Line and the filmmakers of this new version have planned to re-imagine this story into two installments, with the first focusing on the children and then chapter two will be about their grown up selves once again battling Pennywise. So with this first chapter, I think the timing of its arrival couldn't be more perfect especially with last year's debut of the hugely popular series, ""Stranger Things"" that brings up '80s childhood nostalgia while presenting mystery at the same time, ""IT"" offers you that same vein and I think that's OK because we haven't gotten to the point where it's played out so for the time being you're going to love that aspect about ""IT."" There's definitely a ""Stand By Me"" vibe to it as well, and the whole thing does feel episodic, at one point while screening it I didn't want it to end, it felt like I was binge-watching, it was so cool. Kudos to all the young actors featured in this film, they really hold their own and each of their characters' distinct personalities stand out. Their backstories and their process of slowly but surely coming together as some sort of a team is both honest and engaging. 

Now, if you've ever read Stephen King's book, ""IT,"" you'd recall that it is a super duper thick book. You can use it as a stool to stand on for when you need to change that lightbulb. But the point is, I think the screenwriters of this new film did well in condensing the story to just the right amount of time that contains just the right mix of kids camaraderie and the horror fest that is Pennywise. And if you've watched the '90s miniseries, you'd recall how much that version held back plus the low quality practical effects that they had at the time. Well, I'm happy to tell you that this new ""IT"" doesn't hold back, this is Pennywise unleashed, it's practically proud of being R-rated, which is great because it allows for the scary parts to be really really scary and not second-guessing or pandering. 

And if you have never liked clowns before, you're going to hate clowns even more because Bill Skarsgard's performance as the new Pennywise will haunt your dreams for the next few weeks after you've watched this movie. What I appreciate about Skarsgard is that he doesn't try too hard to emulate or imitate or channel Tim Curry, Skarsgard does his own take of creepy. And because Pennywise is pretty much invincible to a certain extent, you'll see him pop up in the most unlikeliest of places meaning when you least expect him, that's when he'll scare you to your core so brace yourselves for surprises around every corner. Another reason why the timing of this movie's arrival could not be more perfect is because today's visual effects compliment Pennywise's limitless abilities and so director Andy Muschietti and his crew have the creative freedom to not only realize some of the scare points in the book but they managed to also go beyond that. ""IT"" goes for massive, it goes for bold, it goes for bloody, not a single boring minute, it goes for the ""Goonies"" fan in all of us. You will laugh, you will scream, you will have nightmares, hands down one of the best horror movies ever made.

"Not worth watching at all Heard so much about this, but when a friend show I was utterly disappointed. I found nothing interesting about it, didn't capture me at all. I wouldn't watch it again and would never recommend. I have watched anime before and thoroughly enjoyed it, but this is really not for me, the type of humor doesn't register at all. I made it 3 (maybe 4) episodes in really trying to make myself like it, but no.

I don't understand what all the hype is about or where it came from. But hey,that's just my opinion. Maybe some day down the road I will return and give it another try, but I highly doubt that, or that I'll enjoy it then.

I'll end with this, It's equally bad or worse than Gotham, and that is utter garbage.",literal
"Good show until 10th episode Have been watching every episode and found it to be a good show until the10th episode. They are supposed to be tracking people to get a sister and brother rescued from men that are looking to get their money back. The bad men kill everyone along the way but the brother. A random guy shows up, kills the ""client."" One guy gets shot in the stomach but manages to fly out? Really does this guy have super powers? The lawyer finds out that someone gets passport pictures done for Canada and the shop just happens to know the criteria? He makes it to the ranger stn, but doesn't kill the ranger and leaves on an ATV? But leaves the truck? Then Coulter makes his way to a set of cabins in the woods and these cabins are cleaned by staff pushing by carts pushed along a rustic path--not believable.

"Interesting show for the first half episodes This show started as a really interesting story and comedy. It had a fast pace, nice set of actors and characters, an idea that love saves all and everything started great. Then something happened at the middle of the first season. By the time the main character's husband started living permanently in the city all of the main storylines started going nowhere. All of the conversations became extremely boring and many of them had no place at all in the show - they felt like ""fillers"". The ""friendship"" that really annoyed me was that of Laura and Ricky Martin's character - how they became suddenly best friends wasn't explained and felt strange. And don't get me started at the final ""twist"" that the manicurist was sleeping with the husband - this is against the main thing we started to root for Maxine and her husband - she was a no one but believed in love and her marriage was the stone that kept her all these years. Such a shame to use these perfect actors and sets and to not have the right script to finish what started so good. The only reason I watched until the end was that I don't like not ending a show I started but there were many times I was asking myself why am I still watching this?",literal
"Good and bad The cinematography is nice, with bright colors and a entertaining 1950s set design. I like that a lot.

There's also some scenes that works fine and the lead young actress is very good.

But off course they can't help themself from throwing in the usual frequent smoking (commercials). And of course they have to keep tell us that people of a certain color are so much better and kinder than another color. Boring, full of clichés and virtue signaling.

I also wish they would have stayed away from the usual bullies, that get to much time, and we have seen them in thousands of other movies already. Why give them the light of day in series after series? Big mistake.

And the cgi is ok in most scenes, but come on! The scene with the kids on the secret terrace looks like a set from ""Gone With The Wind"" from the 40s.",literal

"Decent selection for Netflix. I forgot that Jude Law is such an incredible actor. Now that I've wrapped the series, I believe the show could've been 9 stars if Ben Semanoff directed all the episodes.

"A change too far If you film a much loved book, say Lord of the Rings for this example, and, at the council of Elrond, Gandalf says ""Oh, you want to take the ring to Gondor Boromir? OK then"", fans of the book are going to be disappointed. And that's how I feel right now. Unlike LOTR, The Long Walk does not have a great deal of action in the traditional sense, so why remove what important moments there are: an adolescent who's never had sex risking everything for a kiss? The barbaric nature of huge crowds gathered to cheer on boys about to die? Or to gamble what small funds they have on who will survive? Why remove all the things that made a novel so special and decide your scriptwriter knows best?

The ending is changed and not convincing and while I can imagine Hollywood require more resolution than the original text, I don't think this was the way to go personally.

Apart from the changes, I thought most of the cast did well but were a bit too well fed and healthy for the supposed economic misery this US faced.",literal
"Trash Animation for adults could be an amazing medium, but as long as we keep praising shows like this which can really only be described as ""edgy Family Guy"" it will never happen.

The only redeeming quality is it's smooth animation which is butchered by the terrible, eye strain inducing color schemes. The characters themselves look like something from 2011 DeviantArt. I can't wrap my head around someone going to art school and having such a terrible grasp on basic color theory.

"Modern-day Jane Austen ""Gilmore Girls"" is probably the best show of its kind on TV today.  If Jane Austen were alive today, she'd be writing this show.  It's a great show, first and foremost, because it treats the viewer as an intelligent person and requires one to pay attention.  The rewards for doing so are the dozens of subtle jokes and pop references contained in the torrents of conversation that issue from the characters' mouths - (""Gilmore Girls"" must have the highest words-spoken-per-minute ratio in the history of TV.)

The writing and acting are both superb.  The familiar setting of the small, quirky town allows for the use of many inventive plot devices, like 24-hour dance marathons, picnic basket bachelorette auctions, and vagrants who apply to become the ""official town troubadour.""  You can even throw in a smart-mouthed kid from New York to see how he fares (maybe a tribute to ""Northern Exposure""???)  The progression of the story is well thought-out and well paced.

Each actor really gets a chance to inhabit his or her role because each character, even the most peripheral, is defined by a very distinct personality and not just an occupation (e.g. hotel desk clerk.)  Thus we vividly remember sweet and shallow Shelly, mean Mrs. Kim, and shy guy Brad from Chilton even though they don't appear very often.  The principal actors are tremendous, especially Lauren Graham, Alexis Bledel, Liza Weil and Scott Patterson.  Ever notice the way Luke will sort of tense up/puff up his chest whenever he walks up to Lorelai's table?  That's good acting.

On top of all this there are three characteristics of ""Gilmore Girls"" that make it an exceptional show instead of just high quality.  In the first place, it has good drama without being either melodramatic or manipulative. Think about the way the writers handled the Jess vs. Dean issue, and compare that to ""Friends"" where we have Is-Rachel-Pregnant-Or-Not one episode, Is-Ross-The-Father-Or-Not the next, Did-Joey-Propose-Or-Not the next ad infinitum.  On ""Gilmore Girls"" the drama unfolds not according to plot formulas but the interactions of the characters.

Secondly, the show is female-centered without being self-consciously so or politically charged.  The main characters are female human beings, not symbols.  To whatever extent they are feminist or empowered, the show presents them as such without commenting on it, and that is refreshing.

Finally, ""Gilmore Girls"" takes a unique, thoughtful, and complicated view of the relationship between the generations.  It's billed as a mother-daughter show but is actually a grandmother-mother-daughter show. On most TV shows, the roles of Grandma and Mom are restricted or stereotyped, but here we have three women of a line, Emily, Lorelai, and Rory, who are made of the same material but have led VERY different lives and are trying to get along and be a family.  Occasionally one woman will step outside her role and be a Mom or Kid to one of the others.  And this is also refreshing to see on TV.

If you enjoy quality entertainment regardless of genre, ""Gilmore Girls"" is for you.  Enjoy it while it lasts.",figurative
"Intriguing concept, but lacks coherence and depth Sinner's Bloodlines of the South definitely has potential. The eerie atmosphere of the American South mixed with supernatural elements sounds like a compelling combination on paper. Unfortunately, the execution falls short.

The sudden appearance of a vampire feels abrupt and unexplained, making it seem more like a random twist than an integrated part of the story. Key questions remain unanswered: Why is the vampire here? What is his connection to the main characters? And what role does music play, which seems important but never truly finds its place in the narrative?

The film attempts to be profound but struggles to develop its themes-such as ancestral guilt, identity, and the power of music-in a meaningful way. While there are some visually striking moments and the mood occasionally works, the writing lacks clarity and focus. With better exposition, character development, and buildup, this could have been a memorable experience.

Conclusion: A film full of atmosphere and ambition, but missing the coherence to truly deliver.",literal
"One Of My Favorite TV Shows I love Supernatural. Even with all of the monsters and more going on it still feels like you are a part of the show, invested in every in-between scene and moment. Intertwined with the characters and their in depth personalities and storylines. This show helped me get through some dark times and made me laugh, cry, jump, scream, and more. I have it a 10/10 but truly it would be a 9.5/10 because my favorite part was finding the monsters and solving the case, discovering new things, etc.

It became too convoluted with angels and finding god that it became less and less episodes about monster cases and just 90% lore on Heaven & Hell. The other 10% family stuff. But it's common with a lot of shows, criminal minds for example always about solving cases but became more and more about cases related to the characters of the show and their storylines.

With that said I love supernatural and wouldn't change it for the world, but when I rewatch it for the 12th time I will primarily rewatch the first 4- 5 seasons.",literal
"Best ever waiting for Season2 This is the best ever ever series i watched it is very romantic and legit like too cool . It has been on my mind my since i watched it felt wonderful. It is a fun series that has the right ingredients to provide light and easy-going entertainment, but it does not fall into being simplistic, because it also dares to put interesting topics, perhaps referenced by the creator and her own life experience. The series knows how to take advantage of its originality of the opposite poles, of how much we create and how much we are willing to give for love and when it seems that it gets tangled up in how to solve everything, it intelligently knows how to use the twists to open a new aspect where to captivate.

A nice bet that deserves a chance, that meets the simplicity of a romantic comedy, but offers many more interesting and enjoyable things for a viewer who can watch it with indifference, it is a series that flies by and that perfectly executes the originality of its premise.",literal
"The Diplomat turned rom-com? I honestly loved The Diplomat when it first came out. Season 1 and 2 were incredible - sharp writing, amazing pacing, and just the right mix of political drama, suspense, and action. It had that clever tension that kept you on the edge of your seat you find with the likes of BBC dramas. If I was rating those two seasons alone, it'd easily be a 9 out of 10.

But then came Season 3... and wow, what a letdown. The whole thing just felt flat. Boring, bland, and completely lacking that spark that made the first two seasons so addictive. The suspense and the thriller vibe were pretty much gone, replaced with what felt more like a slow, awkward rom-com between spies and political figures. It honestly felt like a totally different show at times.

Now, I'm not saying it's unwatchable - it's still something fans might sit through just to see where it's heading. I did. Mostly out of curiosity and hope for a comeback in Season 4. But it definitely wasn't the kind of season that leaves you counting down days for the next one.

I really hope the writers and production team take a step back and look at what made Season 1 and 2 so strong. The tension, the unpredictability, the action, the smart dialogue - all of that was missing here. If they can get back to that energy, The Diplomat could easily regain its top star rating.",literal
Amazing show The pilot was amazing. I loved every minute of it and I wanna see more. Especially more of Alastor.,literal
"Raw and emotionally brilliant. When I saw yet another medical drama my eyes rolled once again. I grew up watching ER and to lesser extent Grey's Anatomy when it was good in its earlier seasons. The last medical drama I properly watched was House MD with the wonderful Hugh Laurie.

This show only piqued my interest when I saw the creative team behind it. But I wasn't prepared for was the rawness the show bought to portray a fully functioning ER with all the various facets in perpetual motion, from the staff to the patients.

I'm sure other medical dramas that came after the ones that defined the genre such as ER and St Elsewhere were probably just as good, but this one really struck an emotional chord.

Noah Wyle (who has producer credit also) is utterly fantastic as Dr Robinavitch, he was born to play these roles. If you imagined how a grittier older version of John Carter would have turned out, this is the version onscreen. You can't help shake the feeling it's ER 2.0, but the show needs to stand on its own merits without that. His gradual emotional decline over the episodes is truly heartbreaking, and worthy of numerous award nominations.

The rest of the cast whether you love or hate them share some great chemistry and every one of them gets a chance to shine throughout season 1.

The show centres around the lives, struggles and drama of a Pittsburgh hospital over a day covering the day shift, and the continuity of this blends everything perfectly together into a seamless narrative and has you hooked from the onset and draws you in. The concept draws some parallel with the groundbreaking '24'.

As someone whose partner is in healthcare, you've got to admire the resilience of the staff to cope with some very difficult and emotional situations.

The show leaves you emotionally raw at times, and episode 12 is utterly brilliant and stands as one of the finest hours of television alongside the best and classic 'Breaking Bad, 'Game of Thrones' episodes.",figurative
"The future is the 80's. Efficient action movie vehicle for Schwarzenegger, starring as a framed convicted killer who becomes one of the contestants in sick television game show. He's pursued across a devastated Los Angeles in the year 2019 by trained hit-man. Stephen King's novel with its echoes of The Most Dangerous Game, provides an effective framework for Arnie's tough-guy act, and director Glaser expertly orchestrates the state-of-the-art special effects, nasty violence and unpleasant humor. All I've forgotten is the Girl. All movies like this need a Girl, whose function is to be pulled helplessly behind the hero as he attempts his escape. By casting Maria Conchita Alonso in the role, the filmmakers got more than they bargained for; she remains one of Hollywood's undaunted high spirits, a nice comic counterfoil for Schwarzenegger. The movie's problem is that all of the action scenes are versions of the same scenario. TV host Dawson introduces a killer and his trademark weapons (electrical shock, fire, chain saws, etc.) and then Schwarzenegger faces him in battle. The one element in the movie that is not standard and that does have some energy is the TV show itself, with Dawson's performance as the egotistical, sleaze-bag host.

This film uses the likes of rich corporate adults as the shows mainstream audience loving fellons get butchered the same way. The films special effects are ahead of its time, with believable gore and movie props like futuristic cars and buildings. Richard Dawson is great as the game-show's host, as a lovable teddy bear on screen, and a greedy, self-involved liar backstage. The remaining cast do their jobs well, although they could have found more talented actors. Arnold is Arnold, without him, this movie wouldn't have the box-office appeal that it did, nor would it have the appeal on todays audience that it did. And even though his one liners after each death border on stupidity in this film (with a lot of the other dialogue), his Arnoldness simply makes up for it. This movie was a great and unique idea and it was executed just fine...

Overall rating: 7 out of 10.",literal
"Fifty Shades of Witcher Remember Season 1, when the bromance of Geralt and Jaskier was the cherry on top?

Good times!

Season 2 flirted with modern narratives, and I thought, ""A little seasoning won't hurt the stew, right?""

The first episode of season three even had me thinking, ""Maybe they've nailed it this time!""

But after episode one, it's a downhill tumble - a tragic mix of character assassination and an overzealous buffet of modern narratives.

Characters like Jaskier, Dijkstra, Yen, Triss, and many others - got served a raw deal, and it's as if the show sent character depth to another realm.

I mean, if there's a character-ectomy spell, they aced it.

And the showrunners' love for modern narratives is as blatant as a bard at a funeral. It's like they swapped the monster manual for a modern sociology textbook.

The show's fixation on characters' bedroom antics overshadows, well, everything else. Should we call it ""Fifty Shades of Witcher"" now?

Our dear Witcher, Geralt, is relegated to the sidelines, making occasional cameos like an A-list actor who accidentally signed up for a B-movie. And then, the tragic climax - Henry Cavill leaves the show! Was it a contract dispute, or did he just get a good look at the script?

In an RPG, this would be the moment you smash the ""Load Previous Save"" button.

But alas, no such luck here. I'm downgrading my rating for the entire series from a perfect 10 to a woeful 1.

They came, they saw, and they butchered a franchise. Cue the sad bard music.

Farewell, Witcher. We barely knew ye.",literal
"I didn't mean to watch this My husband had it on and for me it was just background noise. I barely have the attention span to watch a series and so few can keep my interest. Through season one I was kinda keeping up with the plot and occasionally asking questions but still didn't really care. When season two dropped he was a few episodes into it and by now I'm into it, so we started the season over and I'm like ""this is actually a good show."" He puts season 3 on while I was cooking or something idk but again not really ""hooked"" yet so didn't think much of it. I realized he was watching and I'm like ""back it up, I'm in"" so we binged season 3 over the weekend. This is an excellent series. There are so few these days that it actually sets the bar high for others to follow and maybe perhaps itself. I hope it can keep up in season 4. I don't think I've ever given 10 stars on any of my ratings, not sure, but I'm giving it here. This is like one of those books you just can't put down. Last night he fell asleep on the 2nd to the last episode where, normally I would turn it off and we'd finish it together, and I couldn't. I was gripped. Now I'm questioning what to watch next because I know nothing will hit quite the same. Cheers to everyone involved in bringing this series together. Well done!",figurative
"Cinematic Sit-Com: Funny, Honest, and Satire. In short: Smart, funny and mildly satire slice of life that reflects on today's society. Worth coming back to rewatch for the jokes.

In detail: Aziz's direction is clearly heavy on the writing side, it's like watching a simple film that is filled with emotion-driven jokes and script from one to another.

The actors don't even seem to have the need to act out deeply for its delivery on the satire jokes-which is a good thing and that makes the performances look effortlessly funny. Production-wise, the film looks pretty simple and straightforward in terms of audiovisual.

This is a good watch and safe in a family or friends situation, a collection of mildly spicy jabs of jokes that will totally make you laugh.",literal
"Quite awesomeness! I enjoy every genre mashed in except the musical aspect even that is satisfying. The colors are brilliant, the show is comforting, voices are phenomenal, and the madness is glorious! Odd it came out it in 2019 except the pilot the show and continued in 2024 that's probably the only show that has done that. Besides a few adult elements like the vulgarities and a little bit of inappropriate behavior it would be targeted at teen audiences so that's fair. I have been into a few other shows but I'm glad I decided to binge this wild animated ride Hazbin Hotel is it's very worth high ratings no matter who is into the show it's great entertainment.",literal
So dumb This show is so hard to watch. Great concept solid cast but my lord what kind of nonsense is this How do you have a human go to a hospital with a bandage around his eyes and nobody even looks at his eyes and then surprise he's the super dangerous guy that they keep reminding you how trained he is because she trained him and my oh my he's got a plan!,literal
"Even better than the original Creepy as hell, it managed to even outdo the original, as it focused the entirety of its run time on "" It "" stalking and terrorising the group of kids in 1989. The cast of unknown child actors handled the fear, and humour in perfect balance, while Pennywise was even creepier than in the original. There were also a few brilliantly subtle music cues, amongst a lot of crescendos

I want to see horror films return to having a physical villain ( as last year's Green Room, and Don't Breathe, as well as this film has ) rather than yet another ghost story/ supernatural/ haunting flick, like we've had seemingly never ending examples of in the past several years. Granted, this film has supernatural elements in it, but it simultaneously has an actual villain, a physical entity threatening the protagonists, which is where I hope horror films return to. 

Its 135-minutes long run time basically flew by quickly.

The opening credits call the film, It, while the closing credits call the film, It Chapter One. 

The Cult, my all time favourite band, are on the soundtrack, also. Fifteen minutes in, we hear about thirty seconds of Love Removal Machine",literal
"The lines drawn between the reviews... Are laughably obvious, and a lot more telling about the blustering, defensive reviewers than about the show. 

The show was good if you like police procedurals, which I do. I liked Missy Perigrym and her partner and the groundwork they laid so far, character-wise. I hope to see more of Jeremy Sisto. I'll certainly be watching beyond the pilot.",literal
Yule crack up! Christmas Vacation might be the best sequel in Vacation movies but still it is easily forgettable movie. Maybe it's because I don't understand Americans humor quite well. Though there is many hilarious moments in Christmas Vacation I'd rather call this poor comedy. Character played by Chevy Chase is was more irritating than in first Vacation movie. It doesn't made me laugh at once. More simpatico character was cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid) who is stealing the whole show. Comedy writing genius of the 80's John Hughes couldn't deliver this one. Christmas Vacation isn't bad for overall. It just doesn't gives not much laughs.,literal
"Entertaining, but unfortunately it goes a bit off the rails with a story that's too long and not very focused. Roofman is a new crime drama directed, co-written, and produced by Derek Cianfrance, the director of Blue Valentine and The Light Between Oceans.

Jeffrey Manchester (Channing Tatum) is a kind-hearted former war veteran who can no longer make ends meet to support his children. Still, he manages to provide for them by robbing places through the rooftops, earning him the criminal nickname ""Roofman."" After being arrested, Jeffrey manages to escape and hides out in a Toys ""R"" Us. To move on with his life, he tries to start over under a new identity. He helps people wherever he can, even if that sometimes involves criminal activities. He must keep his new and old lives separate to avoid being unmasked and caught by the police.

The film is based on the true story of Roofman Jeffrey Manchester, who, despite his good nature, had to make the wrong choices to survive. Unfortunately, the filmmakers try to present both sides of Roofman's life side by side, which makes the focus feel somewhat unbalanced. It might have been better if the film had concentrated solely on his time hiding in the toy store or on his new undercover life. By covering both aspects and occasionally blending them, the runtime becomes unnecessarily long, making the film feel a bit slow at times. This story might actually have worked better as a documentary series on a streaming platform than as a theatrical film.

Channing Tatum delivers a strong performance as Roofman: despite his criminal actions, he remains a good man who prefers to break as few rules as possible and avoid hurting anyone to earn an income. It's interesting to watch him try to balance his two different personalities.

However, this dual focus means not all cast members get equal time to shine. Actors like Kirsten Dunst, LaKeith Stanfield, and Peter Dinklage each have their moments, but the most fun comes from seeing how Channing Tatum adjusts his acting depending on which of his two identities the other characters know.",figurative
"Ethan Hawke is terrific here I'm a big Ethan Hawke fan so I was looking forward to watching this as soon as I heard about it. Well, this not only met my expectations but surpassed them in every way. Both critics and the audience seem to love The Lowdown, it currently has a ridiculously good 98% on Rotten Tomatoes and the main reason why is because of Ethan Hawke. He leads a terrific cast who are all at the top of their game here. This series has a little of everything...comedy, drama, mystery, action, etc. It's absolutely one of the surprise hits of 2025 and I hope we get more seasons of this. I can't recommend this show enough!",literal
"A Decent Effort Having only ever seen the original with Jodie Foster we booked to see this and fitted in its predecessor only the day before, which we enjoyed. This really is better than the average comedy sequel with plenty of laughs and a whole lot of concentration needed to keep up with who's who. For this reason I would caution against taking young children to see it as it would not be easy for them to follow. Curtis and Lohan are a great film duo and the former really makes it with the character she inherits from the body swaps. I think that in both films, more could have been given to Mark Harmon and in this sequel, they maybe could have got a more energetic actor for the character of Lohan's intended. Overall though, we quite enjoyed this.",literal
"Quality in the Gods A simple yet overlooked idea this show and its premise is truly fantastic. Focusing on the most powerful hero in the world who's rising up the ranks of the superhero world whilst trying to retain his personality there's so much fun to be had. Great action sequences and the perfect blend of comedy/drama/action all on beat to a fantastic score this show is truly brilliant.

"Amazing. Just amazing. A masterpiece of a show. The show had a meh first season but the plot got so much amazing, so much drama and things that happen in the show. Pure perfection, the characters were so into depth, the actors did amazing job. How did this show not win an Emmy? Better Call Saul season 6 was a masterful example of storytelling. The season was exceptionally well structured, with every episode building upon the previous one to create a truly engaging and satisfying story. Each episode had its own plot, while also contributing to the overall narrative and character development. The pacing of the season was also spot on, with each episode providing just the right amount of action, suspense, and emotion to keep viewers invested and wanting more. The final episode of the season also did a fantastic job of wrapping things up, providing a satisfying and meaningful conclusion to the story while also setting up potential plot lines for the future. Overall, Better Call Saul had an amazing run. I think they should do season 7. We need to know if Saul finally got out and things like that. Another overall, 10/10.",figurative
"Give Liam a break Many of the critical comments (and the relatively low rating) seem to revolve around the film not meeting a viewer's expectations. Fair enough, but it just underscores the flawed premise of the imdb ratings, which have grown increasingly unreliable. This film doesn't break new ground, but it is solid entertainment. Doesn't have enough action to make it an action thriller? Too bad. Taken on its own merits, it's watchable, reasonably compelling, and has great scenery. Liam Neeson is always good, and the kid and villain are quite good.",literal
"Why the Hate on Ellen Barkin !! She's freaking great... She portrays her role as Smurf very nicely and believable as to who she's acting out to be. (The Boss & Brains ) Ok so she's old, back in the late 80's early 90's Ellen Barkin was a very desired woman by most men. I even remember how my freinds use to show intrest on how much they wanted to shag her everytime she was on TV or on a movie rental.",literal
"Pure Madness, chaos, and unsettling truth Bugonia (2025) This movie is pure madness - dark, strange, and oddly emotional. Emma Stone and Jesse Plemons absolutely kill it with performances that feel real and uncomfortably human. What starts like a weird sci-fi comedy slowly turns into something deeply disturbing and beautiful. The visuals are stunning, the sound design messes with your head, and the ending leaves you uneasy - like heartbreak that doesn't fully heal.

The story will feel like you know how it will go in your heart, you know how it will work but by the end, you will feel like John snow who knows nothing.

Not for everyone, and that was proved in theatre with a very limited audience but definitely for those who love slow-burn chaos and emotional bruises, and madness in all. A solid 8.5 and a must watch. Lanthimos did it again.",figurative
"Great way to view a tragedy in ife Having had close family and friends struggling and losing life to cancer, I can relate to the main characters including the family members of Cathy Jamison.

Many reviewers mentioned about Cathy's selfishness and apparent self centered attitude. But they failed to put themselves in her position. She had to put up with her childish husband, her confused teenager son, an ever animated brother and her as****** father. It would be already a lot to take for someone even without having to deal with terminal illness. We all know that everyone will die no matter what. Our body is literally dying. It's a fact of life. But it's stil a tough issue to deal with let alone facing death due a cancer. I also like the character arc of her husband and her brother. Their journey from being manchilds to the responsible adults they are supposed to be. Sometimes it takes a tragedy in life to remind us what the most important things in life are.

The acting from the actors are superb even the guest stars such Susan Sarandon, Cynthia Nixon. Without them, the series would lose sparks and interest from viewers.",figurative

"fantastically tense What's the worst thing that's ever happened to you? What's the worst thing that's happened to you today? These questions were posed by writer/director Mary Bronstein to introduce her new A24 movie called IF I HAD LEGS I'D KICK YOU. Like me, you probably just chuckled. The more I think about it, the title is actually perfect. It encapsulates the tone of this panic attack of a movie so well. At times it's humorous, but it's mostly drama with very heavy subject matter and themes. It's about the unraveling of Linda (Rose Byrne), a therapist and worn-down mother of an ill child. A ceiling in their home collapses, starting a chaotic chain reaction of stress-inducing events. Metaphorically, she keeps having her legs kicked out from under her, hence the amazing title. This is a really well-done movie. The metaphors and symbolism are top-notch, not being too obvious or preachy. The script keeps pace while it's shot with a lot of close-ups. Rose Byrne gives us an award-worthy performance. It's harrowing, raw, and relatable. A lot is put on a mother's shoulders, including blame and shame. They are the closest thing to superheroes that we can get. Hell, this is a superhero movie. Conan O'Brian is in this! Playing Linda's therapist, he actually does a great job. So does ASAP Rocky as Linda's neighbor. The director herself knows that this movie won't resonate with all audiences, but I think it'll definitely hit the people it's aiming for. IF I HAD LEGS I'D KICK YOU isn't going to be on my rewatch list, but it packs a lot into so many punches.",literal
"Edie Falco is the best Jackie Peyton (Edie Falco) is an experienced nurse in the public All Saints Hospital in NYC and she's a drug addict. Her marriage to Kevin (Dominic Fumusa) is in trouble. The oldest of her two daughters Grace (Ruby Jerins) is suffering from the family dysfunction. At the hospital, Zoey Barkow (Merritt Wever) is the naive, new nurse. Eddie Walzer (Paul Schulze) is the pharmacist, Jackie's enabler and her secret affair. Thor Lundgren (Stephen Wallem) is the gay nurse. Gloria Akalitus (Anna Deavere Smith) is the manager. Dr. Fitch Cooper (Peter Facinelli) is self-obsessed with a nervous OCD to grab women's privates. Dr. Eleanor O'Hara (Eve Best) is Jackie's rich best friend. In season 5, the staff is joined by new resident Dr. Carrie Roman (Betty Gilpin).

I love Merritt Wever's wacky energy and Ruby Jerins delivers some great performances for a child actor. All that pales in comparison to Edie Falco. This show is 100% all Edie. Her performance in an edgy character is one of the most impressive acting from any actresses on TV. I'm not normally a Peter Facinelli fan but he is perfect for his role in this show. This show has good fun, touching drama and a great cast of characters.",literal
"The Metaphor Of The Original Story No Long Works Nearly As Well In order to understand my dislike of 2025's The Long Walk, a brief history lesson of the original short story is in order:

Before Stephen King ever penned Carrie, threw it in the trash, and had his wife fish it out to begin his literary career, he was writing other stories. The Long Walk was composed during his college years in the 1960s and later released under his Richard Bachman pseudonym. As a story in and of itself, the text is ""just okay"". As a Vietnam War metaphor? Incredible. A bunch of young boys told by ""The State"" to march to their death for the chance at fortune & glory (even when they mostly are being exploited). It was a story for and of its times.

Fast-forward to 2025 and the metaphor doesn't work any longer. Sure, one can kinda-sorta twist it to fit today's ultra-capitalistic society, but it loses much of its punch (especially when the narrative isn't the strongest to begin with).

Add to that a reliance on gore and profanity and The Long Walk starts approaching ""real mess"" territory. The filmmakers here seem to think that every kill-shot needs to be graphically depicted. I'm not objecting on content grounds, but after a time it becomes a trope to goose suspense rather than anything meaningful. The same goes with the high dosage of profanity present. Again, I'm not a prude-but where that language from ""1960s-era college-age boys"" might have worked years ago, in 2025 it simply felt over-the-top to have seemingly every other word be profane. I'm just not sure that is how even young people communicate these days.

It's also a little baffling to me that writer JT Mollner (who penned a great script for Strange Darling) & director Francis Lawrence (of The Hunger Games fame) couldn't mold this into a better film. The ostensible stars-Ray Garraty (Cooper Hoffman) & Peter McVries (David Jonsson)-are fine and the venerable Mark Hamill has a key role, but by the end I was more bored than engaged because the narrative never seemed to compelling lead me anywhere other than a lot of grisly violence and profanity-soaked dialogue.

I think it is very possible that The Hunger Games simply eclipsed The Long Walk in terms of depicting a totalitarian state putting out ""bread & circuses"" competitions for its beleaguered citizens. As such, trying to back-fill King's story with a feature-length motion picture feels (at least to me) like a letdown.",literal
"K.. I Love LA mistakes being ""painfully online"" for being clever and funny. Every character is intentionally ""LA"" content creator-esque and completely insufferable in their own way. The show wants to satirize influencer culture but ends up replicating it, offering nothing new we don't already see daily on TikTok or Instagram. It's not witty or insightful, just another hollow reflection of a world already drowning in a culture of influencers and the false sense of importance/celebrity they portray online. Watching it feels less like satire and more like the real culture we already hate with a dash more of vocal fry. Guess some people consider this funny.. ?",figurative
"A lukewarm re-heat of spicy South Korean film While i was initially intrigued that someone from the west decided to tackle 2003""s Save The Green Planet, and realizing enough time had passed since its release that an entire generation is most likely oblivious to it. I was definitely going to give it a watch, being a big big fan of the original. The film is about an alien posing as a large tech CEO and the humans that hope to expose her to the world at large. It combines the suspense, psychological thriller, horror, and dark comedy genres(the original also had romance)but that was apparently nixed in this new interpretation. The aesthetic was dark and believable, i will confess to being unfamiliar with this director but he seems to have a particular style that hes after but it just didnt have the same impact on me as the original film. Im not sure if its because the special twisty ending already been revealed but i just couldnt take the main protagonist serious in this version and i felt like even if i hadnt seen STGP that it would have been one of those endings that almost felt predictable because they were trying so hard to make you focus on one aspect that it had to be a red herring, whereas Planet completely blindsided me with the ending. For sure it was not an easy film to remake by any stretch of the imagination. This is a very serviceable attempt, just not a really great one like its predecessor imo.",literal
"Please read the book Could only watch a third of this dreadful mess. Del Toro has decided that Mary Shelley's polemic on the human condition should instead focus on Victor. While Victor's flaws are indeed relevant in the book, and his moral cowardice in taking responsibility for his actions provide the narrative this isn't the focus or point of the book. It is how society deals with the monster it created that is the whole point of the metaphor. The technical details of its construction are irrelevant. There hasn't been a film made that reflects this, perhaps because a great part of the book concerns philosophical issues which are 'entertaining'. Reminded me of Jurassic Park which ignored much of the interesting points made in the book in favour of simplistic monsters. Btw in the book the monster isn't out to kill Victor; but Victor's guilt makes him seek out the monster in the frozen north in order to kill it.",figurative
"An exercise in paranoia This film is an exercise in paranoia. I have to say it's not an enjoyable watch, however it is thought provoking.

Pascal and Phoenix (ably supported by Stone, O'Connell, Ward, and others) are very good. I would say there's a juxtaposition between the two main characters, but it's not quite true. All of the characters are imperfect, and not very likeable - they're all guilty of something, and that guilt combines and builds, fuelling a growing sense of doom, which it's difficult to escape.

What this film portrays, I think, is small town America, during the pandemic. But the essence, self interest, and amorality could be transplanted anywhere. Having said that it also feels like a microcosm of today's USA - polarised, introspective, and in trouble.

Aster's Directing is excellent, although can tend a little to visual hyperbole. The script is decently sparse and crisp.

All in all a very good film, but not one to watch if you want to feel entertained or comfortable.",literal
"Only Murders in the Building This was a phenomenal show! It is so much better than I thought it would be. I started watching this show late. I didn't start watching it till 6 episodes in. I saw commercials for it before it aired, but it didn't peak my interest. Then, weeks later, I am scrolling through Disney+, this show catches my eye, so I decide to start it. (I live in Canada. We don't get Hulu, Disney+ Canada imports some of Hulu's shows to the country). I binged the first six episodes of the show in under 48 hours. I then had to wait for episodes weekly which is normal. Because this show is a murder mystery, I feel making the fans wait a week for each episode built so much more suspense than if all episodes were released on the same day. I loved everything about this show. The acting, the writing, the characters, and the story. Martin Short, Steve Martin, Selena Gomez, and everyone else, and I mean everyone were absolutely perfect in their role. My favorite was Martin Short as Oliver Putnam. The character of Oliver was so quirky and funny, and Martin Short was perfect for him. Oliver wasn't the only perfectly written character. All of the main three, as well as the side characters, and all the suspects were so unique in their own way, especially most of the suspects. They were all funny. It was perfect. Lastly, the writing of the show was perfect. The writers made the perfect murder mystery. The suspects, the leads, the red herrings, all perfect. I also loved the character development of the characters. It was cool to see their backstories.

This show was incredible. Everything about it. I 100% recommend this to anyone. Trust me, you won't regret it. They left us on a massive cliffhanger at the end of season 1, I need to find out what happens next. Can't wait for season 2!",literal
"Worth a Watch, But Not the Best Me personally, I thought this movie was pretty good. This is a story that actually DESERVED to be made into a movie. And yes, if you didn't already know, this movie is heavily based off a true story. I like the story, the acting is pretty good, and it's a pretty funny movie. But, there are some boring sections and the movie kind of drags on for an extra 20 minutes. For a movie about a guy who robbed 45 McDonalds, there wasn't a lot of McDonalds robbing (Only occurs once). But overall, it deserves a watch and you should check it out.",literal
"Don't waste your time! Started off interesting, but it went downhill fast. For a show called The Running Man, there's hardly any actual running - and barely any of the main guy being hunted. Instead, random characters jump in to help him with zero believable motivation, risking their lives or even dying for someone they literally just met from a TV show. It didn't make sense and completely killed the tension.

By the time the ending rolled around, it was just ridiculous. Nothing felt earned, nothing felt thrilling, and it all wrapped up in a way that left me wondering why I even bothered.

Honestly, I prefer the old Arnie version by miles. At least that one knew what it was supposed to be.

Don't waste your time.",literal
"Best of the ""Law & Order"" spin-offs Other than the original ""Law & Order"" police-drama created by Dick Wolf, spin-off series ""Law & Order: Special Victims Unit"" is the best. This series focuses on the SVU, a section of the New York Police Department that specializes in sexually-based offenses. Here, on the ""Law"" side, we're introduced to ultra-cool cop duo Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and Elliot Stabler (Christopher Meloni), supported by John Munch (Richard Belzer) and Fin Tutuola (Ice-T) and watched over by Cpt. Donald Cragen (Dann Florek). Other supporting characters include M.E. Warner (Tamara Tunie) and Dr. Huang (B.D. Wong). On the ""Order"" side, we have ADA Casey Novak (Diane Neal, who replaced ADA Alexandra Cabot, who was played by Stephanie March for five seasons). I think this is the highest-rated spin-off because it's the most accessible. We have characters we really like, and we're continuously showed their lives on and off the job, and I think that's what draws us in each week for more. I still occasionally read stories about how some of the actors on ""SVU"" are approached on the street by fans of the show and are told how much they mean to them. That's a mark of truly great television, don't you think?

"Master piece ""Better Call Saul"" is an exceptional prequel to the acclaimed series ""Breaking Bad."" This show brilliantly expands on the universe, focusing on the transformation of Jimmy McGill into the morally ambiguous lawyer Saul Goodman. Bob Odenkirk's performance is nothing short of spectacular, bringing depth and nuance to a character that was initially portrayed as a comic relief in ""Breaking Bad."" The writing is top-notch, with compelling storylines that intertwine legal drama and personal struggles. The cinematography and direction are visually stunning, capturing the essence of Albuquerque. Each character, from Mike Ehrmantraut to Kim Wexler, is well-developed and adds richness to the narrative. ""Better Call Saul"" is a masterclass in storytelling, maintaining high tension and emotional engagement throughout. It's a must-watch for both fans of ""Breaking Bad"" and newcomers looking for a gripping, character-driven drama.",figurative
"Solid I enjoyed this from the very first initial episode. Main characters are so very likeable and believable. I am truly SO tired of main characters who are TOO intense and TOO conflicted and TOO cantankerous and TOO ""deep"" with so much adversity between characters (boss versus underlings, townspeople versus authority, etc). This particular cast exhibits real and true people and is SO refreshing. Plots are also realistic and compelling. My gosh, I hope I have not ""jinxed "" this by my comments. I really hope the producers are aware of the value of this show and renew and renew! TOO often i f8nd myself enthralled by a new series and it's canceled.

"a masterpiece Cinema is back on! 'Wicked' casts a spellbinding charm on the big screen! Director John M. Chu masterfully adapts Gregory Maguire's beloved novel and the stage show, bringing Oz's iconic witches to life. Cynthia Erivo shines as Elphaba, complexity and depth radiating from every note. Ariana Grande dazzles as Glinda, comedic timing and vulnerability perfectly balanced. Their chemistry ignites a poignant exploration of friendship, prejudice, and self-discovery. A must-see musical spectacle for the whole family, probably the biggest movie of the year and a big award contender. Could it give movies like 'Titanic' and 'Return of the King' a run for their money??",figurative

"Contact + Body Snatchers + Borg + Overacting We have been living in a ""remix culture"", as Tim Berners-Lee put it, since at least the mid-1990s. This TV-Show seems to be another example. Nevertheless, the series is fascinating, beautiful and sports some nice ideas, no question. And let's see where all this leads. But man, do I hate this Wine-""Mum"". I know, that's Gilligan's intention. But I found many of her scenes extremely overacted. I mean like ""first semester of acting school""-overacted. So I have no problem with the character, but with the portrayal. Unfortunately this bothers me so much that I find it difficult to rate the series higher - after two episodes.",literal

"What is this pleasant, happy mess? Kristen Wiig is a marvelously talented comedian who can probably do drama just as well; there seem to be no limits to her talent. There are, however, innumerable limits to this particular show -- most of all, the show hasn't any idea what it is. Sometimes it's a drama, sometimes a comedy, sometimes it's sad, sometimes it's surreal, sometimes it's lifelike. There are shows that can pull off this multiple identity issue but unfortunately this one doesn't come close. It doesn't do any of them well.

In fact, Palm Royale doesn't even seem like a show. What it is is a collection of sketches about the lead character. There's no through line, however. Just sketches. The characters all seem to have been told nothing about their last appearance; the show feels as if it was shot in random order. Nothing makes sense. Wiig is supposed to be a climber (literally, as in the first scene) but then it's later revealed that she's possibly the heiress to the most important person in Palm Beach (played by Carol Burnett, who manages to make a comatose patient funny). Sometimes she seems flush with money, but then she's broke. Then rich. Then broke. And if she really thinks she's going to inherit a fortune any moment, why make herself a fool in from of the people she most wants to impress instead of waiting a bit longer? The show is rife with problems like this.

Also, Palm Royale is set around 1969 but the characters all talk like it's 2024 -- they use slang that didn't exist then (especially the currently ever present ""like,"" which didn't appear for many decades to come). Worse, the amazingly talented Laura Dern is playing a feminist who doesn't seem to grasp what feminism is; in fact, all the chatter among the feminist group is far too modern. No one on the show seems to have done any research into what women at the time actually were saying or doing -- there are silly anachronisms throughout, such as the women's bookstore being called Our Bodies, Our Shelves, a riff on the Our Bodies, Our Selves group that started later in 1969, and didn't become well known until well after the famous book was published in 1970. Or, people saying ""Thank you for your service,"" a phrase that wasn't popular until decades later. A carefully thought-out show like Madmen would never have made such a mistake.

The show is just too sloppy and incoherent to really work, which is truly a shame as the amount of talent in the cast is phenomenal. But unless the writers can start telling a coherent story, this is a sad muddle of a mess with just a few funny moments.",literal
"Pleasantly surprised I usually don't take in tv shows even limited series but this peaked my interest. I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly it grabbed my attention and kept it there.

Who would have thought that a 75 year old female would like this! I have no hesitation in recommending this. A great show.",figurative
"Irritating Yorgos Lanthimos is a Director, whose films I keep going to see, as they all promise to be a little odd. This film is no exception but, like all of his films, leaves me feeling either short changed, or foolishly expectant of a rounded and well finished work.

Credit is due to the main cast - Plemons, Stone and Delbis, are all excellent. The story is topical - rabbit holes, conspiracy, the nature of truth, and overwhelming paranoia.

The Direction is, mostly, spot on, with the film moving at a decent pace, although it does sag occasionally with either overwrought dialogue, or silence in the wrong place.

Without spoiling this, the final scenes are both daft, and eventually redolent of a sixth form film project gone wrong. I don't know what was in the mind of the Director, it these scenes undermined the dramatic value of the rest of the film, and left me feeling irritated, again, with Lamthimos. However the person I was with didn't see it that way - so different strokes.",literal
Pure fun and Entertaining These movies are always fun. The concept is still there. Over the top magic and the new characters shows the progression of the new generation along with the old generation.

People are expecting realistic scenarios and movies like this is for people who just want to turn their thinking hats off and just have fun.10/10.,literal

"Our type of drama. Ready for season 2 Starting watching this show at my friend's house last week as we both love Amirah Vann (Gina) from since her Underground days. It's been a pleasant surprise. The premise itself is emotional - a brilliant doctor losing years of memory and trying to piece her life back together - and while it has the usual medical drama tropes, the cast makes it engaging.

Is it perfect? No. Some of the storylines feel predictable and you can tell it's following a familiar formula. But it also has heart, and when it leans into the emotional core - memory, identity, and relationships - it works.",literal
"Liked the show until Dawson got too much air time Show was pretty good up until season 4, i loved almost all of the characters except for Dawson, i don't really know if it is because of the actress or just the character she's playing but she is TERRIBLE in all aspects.",literal
"Great books but shows are at best ok Many of the characters are poorly cast and poorly acted. The 45 minutes for tv doesn't leave enough time to do justice to the plots.

"The Superman I didn't know I was waiting for I love superhero films, and even though I'm not a comic book geek, I love movies about them.

We all know Superman is the OG. The Reeve films had their hits and definite misses, Bryan Singer's take was good enough, and Zack Snyder brought an almost perfect iteration of the Man of Steel with Cavill. So my expectations were all over the place.

I'm so relieved, because this one made me happy and spoiled me in all the right ways. David Corenswet has the potential to become my favorite Superman, and the same goes for Rachel Brosnahan as Lois Lane. Oh, and Nicholas Hoult as Lex Luthor... spot on.

I've always loved James Gunn's writing and filmmaking. That mix of intelligence, humor, and heart is why the Guardians of the Galaxy trilogy is my favorite in the MCU. Here, he delivers the same balance: action and comedy perfectly dosed, with real respect for the characters and the lore.

The story itself is simple, let's be honest, nothing we haven't seen before, but it works great. It's hard to explain, but in this film it feels like the story comes second, while the characters take center stage. You might forget the story, but not the characters. And I must add, I find it fascinating how Gunn keeps introducing heroes I barely knew and somehow makes them shine.

This is probably my favorite Superman ever put on screen. It captures the strengths of all previous versions and distills them into one film.

Would I watch it again? Oh yeah. I can't wait to see where this new DC Universe goes.",figurative
"A great crime drama Two brothers descend to lower and lower lows as they try to keep their restaurant afloat.

I wasn't sure about this, so I skipped over it at first. I couldn't find anything else, so I pretty much had to come back around to Black Rabbit. Anyway, it stars Jude Law and Jason Bateman, who can both be good. What I really wanted was a scifi or horror movie because I was feeling kind of burned out on crime dramas. However, I'm glad I watched this.

It's difficult at times to watch the brothers make so many stupid, life-wrecking decisions. The thing is, the series tries to give them justifications for each of these actions. As one exasperated character points out, there's always some lame excuse. If you're one of those people who require the leads to be likeable, this is probably the wrong series for you.

If you're used to watching flawed, kind of slimy characters work their way through neo-noir plots, you'll probably make it through Black Rabbit easily enough, though. The story progresses as a leisurely pace, but I thought the tension and interesting characters made it work. Unfortunately, a few characters did not get enough characterization. I guess they got squeezed out by the flashbacks, heart-to-heart conversations, and arguments, all featuring the brothers.

The atmosphere and tension were great, as was the acting. Seeing Jason Bateman playing a three-time loser was pretty cool, too. I was all set to be skeptical about Jude Law playing his brother, but I thought they pulled it off. By the end of the first episode, I was convinced they were siblings. Although the rest of the cast don't get as much time to shine, the antagonists were also pretty cool. Those roles actually got explored fairly well, unlike the family and friends. In fact, there are so many family and friends, it took an episode or two before I could remember who they all were without checking the IMDb.

If you're looking for something fast-paced with obvious good guys and obvious bad guys, this isn't the show for you. This is pretty much the opposite of a superhero movie. On the other hand, if you're dying for entertainment targeted to an adult demographic, definitely check it out.",figurative

The take off was smooth and enjoyable, then once it got in the air you sat back really enjoying the ride.

"The leftover scraps of a cold dino dish. I wanted to like this but from the get-go the writing and execution was weak even for a toyline.

The pacing and thrills lack in excitement, and the plot buffers with characters who don't really have any involved interest or connection to dinosaurs, other than the goal of a few, all of which made for a further disconnection from a good experience.

The scene's failure to convey any classy kind of comedy or thrilling longevity of action or chemistry felt rather diluted and surface-level.

The characters we do have, basically spend their time barking at eachother and surviving through abled plot-armor.

The previous films had a more dense threat of dinosaur disasters. Here, we have a fleeting glimpse and nothing further. The film takes a while and barely introduces the dinosaurs.

The plot felt written for a TV movie, just shallow all around. Gone is the charm and magic or detail-heavy set pieces. Scream, stand still, repeat. Run.

I expected more but these days it seems like anyone thinks they can write a script or screenplay and that everyone will care for it.

This film lacked interesting characters who have a deep connection to dinosaurs to make their story more than a quick escape, and lacked a relevant amount of dinosaur mayhem.

I read the first Jurassic Park book so I expect a bit more than a group of scifi channel characters simply always driving away in the end. No dinosaur battle or anything, just a failed dinosaur hunt you saw in passing.

You learn to expect more, and that's coming from someone who loves this franchise. This one didn't have interesting characters and there were too many characters just barking at eachother not even interested in dinosaurs to make a connection to the plot other than survival and choosing the people in the end.

Glad I didn't pay to see this one.",literal

"Did I miss something? Soooooo Fox cancels ""The Resident"" in 2023 to bring in another medical drama that is clearly to me struggling from jump. I found myself by force trying to give this show a chance. I'm just not sold on the story or the acting. Doc is desperately trying to walk in the footsteps of ""The Resident."" It doen not have it's own lane at all. The main character, she just doesn't have it. Her acting is double bogey on a golf course. She doesn't have the look or the jolt to spark a fire to make this show take off. The other cast members doesn't help the show from failing imo. Whoever picked this cast did a horrible job. I don't feel or see the passion from these actors like I did with ""The Resident."" With TR, I was reeled in like fish in its first 5 minutes. I could not stop watching ""The Resident."" It produced a great story, with a bunch of seasoned actors and familiar faces with quality. I loved every minute of it. Doc, on the other hand, I'm sure it will be canceled by the end of its first season. It has no juice. Don't even waste your time trying it. It is very hard to watch. My wife both agree!

Various characters - a major at an Alaskan military base, a senior White House official, a general and the President - attempt to handle the fast approaching crisis.

Who knows they could be gearing up for a sequel, as we never see the missile explode (unlike in those early 1980s nuclear nightmare films), or find out whether it was a dud which never exploded, or a test dummy run. In fact this political thriller is a bit of a mystery - was it the North Koreans, the Chinese or the Russians wot done it?

"The best of 80's nostalgia in one movie! I don't understand how anyone can describe this movie as anything short of a masterpiece.  So, all comedies are not funny anymore after you've seen them for quite a few times, but the difference with Weird Science is that you can still watch it over and over again, without getting bored with it.  It is fun to watch, and it should appeal to anyone, not people who were teenagers in the 80's.  I myself, am now only 19, so, I was no teenager in the 80's, but with an intelligent, objective, opinion, I'd say 80's movies and music are the best.

Despite the fact that Wyatt and Gary ""create"" Lisa, who cares if it is unrealistic?  If you can live yourself into this movie, become part of the fun, you'd have a ball.

All the main characters are very funny.  Parts I single out is Lisa asking the old lady for advice on underwear for a 15 year-old; Chet turning into that little monster, Gary and Wyatt in the mall, the list goes on!

Even the special effects are quite good for that time.

Apart from funny moments throughout the movie, in the end you can also learn something, where Gary says to Debbie:  ""Because I want you to like me for me"", and she replies:  ""Whatever you are I like it"".  Whereas today, money, looks, etc. are the thing.

It is also so sweet in the end, where Lisa says goodbye, what she says to them, the farewell, it is just so overall endearing!  Which just makes you love this movie even more.

The sound track is also quite nice, with Weird Science being played at just the right moment each time.

I've come across a few people who always give negative comments about this movie, and surprisingly enough they're all teenagers in the 90's mostly. My advice to anyone watching this movie, remember the 80's was a different era than now, the fashion, the music, everything was different.  Take time out, and just see this movie for what it is, a great fun-filled movie, that anyone can enjoy.  The prejudice that such a lot of people have against the 80's is beyond comprehension to me anyway.  Anyone who watches it, cant help but go crazy about Gary, Wyatt and Lisa, who are all such endearing characters.

This is one of my favorite movies of all time, and the fashion and the music in it just adds to that 80's nostalgia that this film gives you.

To end off this movie could do with a sequel, with Gary and Wyatt, married, life going downhill again, and once again calling upon Lisa to ""straighten"" them out.

I gave it 10/10.  Watch and see if you do too.",figurative

Then rapid fire nurses telling the doctors how to treat the patients and rolling their eyes when they disagree.

Crazy and suspenseful storyline aside, the acting by Channing Tatum and Kirsten Dunst was very well done and the chemistry between them made this movie even more credible and heart wrenching near the climax.

"The Citizen Kane of Amateur Slop Shelby Oaks is poorly written and directed. The plotting is akin to 12 year old children sitting around a campfire telling horror stories and adding parts as they go along. While a child might assume he/she is clever, once grown up, they'd realize how hollow and uneducated their imagination is in reality. This director doesn't know how to tell a story and has the imagination of a child who's seen some movies from his parent's film collection.

I'm reporting from AMC Times Square. Within 15 minutes, this movie died, and so did the audience. Throughout the 70 minutes of quiet boredom, one audience member belched, another groaned and another walked out. The movie went on life support and it never recovered. The film has no pace, no rhythm, no tension. It feels like a student film with a bigger budget. How could anyone release this? I've never seen an amateur production like this released in an AMC theater.

The ending rips off Hereditary and Rosemary's Baby, but has no point of its own. It's not clever. There's no character development. No heart. Just random symbols, CGI animals, and pure aimlessness.

When the movie ended, the audience was laughing in amazement. A joke of a film we all suffered through. One must finally say, what was the point?",literal
"Solid 7, but I doubt people would watch this if it weren't a spin off This show has very little to do with Breaking Bad, but it's still a spin off. The immense success of Breaking Bad has brought a lot of goodwill and patience to this show.

This is the Fly episode, which so many people complained about, except here, every episode is a Fly episode. The whole show is a Fly episode.

It's not that fun to watch. Seeing Saul, Mike, Tuco and co. gives viewers patience for watching this show that they'd never have with another show. Had this very same show been done before Breaking Bad, it would not last a season.

Show this show to non-Breaking Bad fans and they would struggle to enjoy it. It's not good enough as a standalone show.

It's just too slow and there's too little story. It's piggybacking on the success of Breaking Bad, definitely, and I don't blame them for that. But there's just not enough meat to sustain this sandwich.

Standalone (new) shows have to try so much harder to get this kind of success, but no show can survive with so little story and so few events. A season of this show has fewer events than 2 Breaking Bad episodes.

I give it a 7, but I think one of those 7 stars comes directly from it being related to Breaking Bad. I'm not overrating by association. We know these characters and where they're going, so there's more to the show/story/characters than what's on the episodes.

Had we not known the futures of Saul, Mike and co. we'd really be watching a show about a goofy lawyer and a parking attendant wondering where it's going and when are we getting there.",literal
"They should have ended it many seasons ago I lasted until the Covid season and then finally gave up. The show's quality seriously deteriorated over the seasons before that, but the Covid one was a complete disaster and finally a tipping point for me! It shouldn't have lasted more than 10 season to be honest. If that was the case my rating would have been a lot higher. But hey it seems to make money so they keep the train rolling.

Anyways if you are looking for an interesting medical show with a fare share of drama, the first few seasons do a solid job. If you are looking for sci-fi medical show with a soup opera level of impossible pots and twists however, that somehow still manage to be boring as hell, well then congratulations, and enjoy watching the 20+ and rising number of seasons.",literal
"Great start but the writing needs work Let me start by saying I was introduced to this series by a fan when it was Helluva Boss. I think the animation is aesthetically pleasing, the musical numbers are catchy (and have legit broadway stars behind them), and the storyline is interesting and engaging. My problem is with the dialogue writing alone.

When a storyteller creates a world, they need to stick to the rules of that world. The actual dialogue of the show is sometimes clever and engaging and sometimes sophomoric and juvenile. It's disappointing given how much this show has going for it. The swearing and sexual comments are fine for expressing character, but like too much salt in food, overusing them makes it almost unpalatable.

The sloppy writing breaks the world of the show. It just doesn't fit and makes the quality go down overall. I hope season two brings a more mature and cohesive feel to the dialogue because everything else about this show is enjoyable.",literal
"Excellent cast can't save this show from itself Great cast and the makings of a good story slowly descend into a mawkish, preachy mess.

The writers need to get out of their own way and trust that the audience is smart enough to understand the messages through the story and acting. Instead, they use clunky exposition and tired tropes to explicitly state every moralistic stance. It feels like an Ayn Rand novel--wooden characters acting out a morality play to batter an audience into submission. There is so much potential here, but it's drowning in Hummel figurines and Geraldine Ferraro pins.

I honestly agree with most of the points the show makes, but it's just so overdone. Hopefully the writers can back off and let the story breathe in season 4.",figurative
"Real World Resemblance Fallout TV show is good. It is more than good. Fun, clever, you name it. Very good and surprisingly good.

One of the best series ever made Absentia it is one of the best series i've ever seen. The complexity of the scenario impressed me in a positive mode. The actors combined perfectly with their role. The emotion made this serial perfect! Can't wait for the season 2.,literal
"More Gossip Girl than Peaky Blinders It had so much potential and i wanted to like it.. It looks good and soundtrack is sick, but thats it. Very boring and when it seems that things starts to happen it just focuses on these complicated xoxo gossip girl relationships. Because of Knight i was looking forward to this but FOR ME it failed badly. But im optimistic and i hope that Season 2 is waaay better.",literal
"Shocked by the 6.6 rating! I absolutely love Kristen Wiig and I enjoy Tate Taylor for directing Ma, The Help, Get on up are great movies! Palm Royale seems under-appreciated plus my mom recommended it and she usually great stuff. I often get jealous when I see anything about Beautiful locations I don't get to be around them much. Women empowerment is wonderful in a lot of cases most deserve respect and admirable. I usually enjoy Laura Dern sometimes she's played overly angry characters and other times I love her like in Big Little Lies she was phenomenal; my favorite is when she said ""I will not be not rich"". Anyway definitely recommend this series.",figurative
"Amazing. Although they have predicted the future in a completely unrealistic way, I find the film quite good, the story is pretty good, the actors shine in these roles, the references to other films make the film even more fun and the action scenes are wonderful. Highly recommend.",figurative
"Solid, but lacking something. I generally enjoy this show, but the relationships are so choppy that it doesn't give enough emotional depth to the characters. I would like to see more character development and instead of wrapping up the stories in one episode, it could dig in and spend a few episodes on these jobs he is hired to do. I also feel like they are trying to put Colter and Reenie in a potential relationship, but there is no spark there whatsoever. I enjoy both of their characters individually, but you must see the writing on the wall, this only should ever be a friendship. If you want a spark, then your going to have to get some actual flint.",literal
"1st half was torture... It was a decent effort, but only the second half really worked for me. The first half felt painfully slow, dull, and uneventful. I get that the movie needs to set things up and ease you into the story so that the later events make sense, but it dragged far too long-almost 50 minutes of buildup that didn't earn the payoff. Once the mystery finally started moving, it got much more engaging and tense, and you could see glimpses of the potential it had all along. Still, by that point, it was a bit too late to fully recover the lost momentum.",literal
"Won't be sticking with it I gave this show two episodes. I was excited because A) Sherlock/Watson and B) Morris Chestnut. First episode I could hardly follow. I love medical shows and I am pretty smart, but it was like Gilmore Girls - nonstop talking for the sake of talking. I had to keep jumping back a few seconds and finally gave up.

Like other reviewers, I can't understand why they went the Watson angle with this. Granted my knowledge of this universe is limited to the BBC's Sherlock, but this doesn't feel like Watson at all. It feels like Sherlock Holmes - arrogant and obnoxious.

Watched the second episode and realized I just don't care - which is so unfortunate because I'd already been set to record the season based on Morris being in it. I don't care about the secondary characters, with what little we know of them. I don't think they add much and I'm not curious to know more. Who's the British guy? Don't really care. Why did Watson collect these sidekicks? I don't really like any of them, so I don't care. And I liked Inga Schlingmann from So Help Me Todd, so it's disappointing to not care about her in this. Usually shows start off much more gripping to get me hooked, but this didn't pull me in. I said I'd give it another episode just in case, but that just confirmed what I felt after the pilot.

It's also a show about medical stuff that has very little medical stuff. It just feels like a half-baked show idea that had way more potential for me before I started watching. And for the reviewer who things this is being panned because the main actor is Black, I totally disagree. It's being panned because it's not a great show.",literal
"combines thrilling plots with rich cultural storytelling Dark Winds is an exceptional TV series that masterfully blends elements of noir, thriller, and even sci-fi, creating a gripping and immersive experience. Set in 1971 on the Navajo Nation, the show follows Lieutenant Joe Leaphorn and his deputy, Jim Chee, as they navigate a series of complex and interconnected crimes. The storytelling is top-notch, with each episode unraveling layers of mystery and character depth.

The cast delivers outstanding performances, particularly Zahn McClarnon as Joe Leaphorn, whose portrayal of a man haunted by his past is both powerful and nuanced. The chemistry between Kiowa Gordon (Jim Chee) and Jessica Matten (Bernadette Manuelito) adds a heartfelt dimension to the series, providing moments of warmth amidst the tension.

Overall, Dark Winds is a must-watch for fans of crime dramas and anyone looking for a series that combines thrilling plots with rich cultural storytelling. Highly recommended!",literal
"Very pleasantly surprised !! Sylvester Stallone is officially back with a non pc action/comedy, he actually has great comic acting and Timing! This is for your old school action /comedy fan's. There won't be a massive intellectual storyline but as long as we get to see Stallone beat up some people I'm happy. Martin starr is also very good as the wimpy dispensary store owner, He's a very good actor and is underrated in the roles he takes on. I love watching the action stars of the 70/80/90s. It's great too see them keeping this genre alive with old school action and humour. You don't need them to dress up in skin tight uniforms and have magical powers to have a solid action movie/ tv show. This is a breath of fresh air and I hope they keep making programs like this and keep away from superhero stuff.",figurative
"This is not a 9/10 show I don't know, guys - 9/10? That's high praise for what's an interesting premise but not a whole lot more than that at this point.

Random thoughts and observations.

1. My wife walked in the room, not knowing what it was and said ""why are you watching such a B movie?

2. The show has been described as ""funny, comedic, hilarious"". Really? This is a comedy? I honestly had no idea - not a single laugh.

3. #3 removed because the moderator thought I was being homophobic even though I wasn't.

4. Many of the characters the main character interacts with (the people that are unaffected, like her) just act so dumb - it was so frustrating to watch.

5. Yes, the premise is interesting. It makes you want to keep watching to find out where it will end up.

6. There are some interesting WTH moments that belong in sci-fi series.

7. Unfortunately I feel like I'm always one step ahead of the story. It's too slow, like it's giving you time to let everything sink in so you can understand, but it's actually easy to grasp once you see what's happening.

8. The main character is not very likeable. I wish she was, because she seems to be a decent actress.

10. The main character also does not seem that smart. She knows how her actions affect people and yet she keeps doing it. That adds to her unlikability.

11. The ""pirate lady"" is beautiful and has enough charm to make her watchable.

12. It does seem like the story they're trying to tell is relevant for our times - it has that going for it.

13. A lot of the other reviews seem like fans of Apple, Gilligan, or both. Some even appear to be written by AI. Some even write about it as if they've seen the whole season, there are only 2 episodes out so far. It makes me raise my eyebrows.

14. I still have hope for this series! Maybe it's a slow build while being a bit frustrating, but maybe it will all pay off in the end. Overrated, but still interesting enough to keep watching.",figurative
"First season spoilers Pretty good show so far. The big problem for me is the cops. You are going to use a heroin addict to pose as a School teacher. Have her get close to a 17 year old student so you can get information about the family. NO. Just NO.

All the army base stuff is absurd. The cops are putting a drug addict in a School to get to J, but they are not following the family around? Ok, whatever. I prefer something a bit more realistic. Again, the show is pretty good. Nothing more.",literal
"Evan Peters is terrific here! I want to star off by saying Dahmer - Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer story (what a ridiculous title) is a very tough watch. I grew up about 30min from Milwaukee and even though I was a little kid when he was arrested I still remember this story being a huge, especially around here. How he was able to get away with what he did for as long as he did is very troubling. The police dropped the ball time and time again and lots of innocent lives were lost because of it. Evan Peters deserves every bit of recognition he's getting from this series, he was brilliant. The rest of the cast is good too but it's Peters who makes this show what it is.",literal
"The worst movie of 2000 (spoilers) This adaptation of the classic Dr Seuss story is directed by Ron Howard, whose flair for stunning visuals is matched only by his full head of hair. This looks terrible.  The sets look like something I got free with a Happy Meal.  Remember the plastic rocks in the Flintstones movies?  They were quarried to make these sets.

Ron Howard is a great director, but he hasn't got any unique style.  As much as I love Apollo 13, Backdraft and Ransom, they're not particularly exciting to look at.  He's just not the right director for something like this. Couldn't the idiot-execs look for someone else?  Tim Burton isn't the only guy in Hollywood with an imagination.  Okay, he probably is, but you'd think there'd be someone who can fake it better than Ron Howard.  In place of invention, we have only wonky camera angles.  `Hey, guys, put the camera on a 45 degree angle, that'll give it an other-worldly kind of look.'

Jim Carrey, in the lead role, is as annoying as always.  Having toned things down for The Truman Show and even for Me, Myself and Irene, he's back to his old rule of comedy for The Grinch: loud = funny.  Look! at his arms flailing around wildly.  See! his face contorted into comical expressions.  Yawn! as you realise you've seen it all before.

I haven't read How the Grinch Stole Christmas, so I can't say how this works as an adaptation, but I can say how it works as a movie.  It doesn't.  It doesn't work at all.  There's no magic, there's no awe or wonder.  And it gets the pace and the tone so wrong you'd think this was a first time director.  If this is how Ron Howard's movies are going to turn out from now on he'd better cross his fingers for a  Happy Days reunion.

The plot, which is covered in 60-something pages in the book, is too thin for a hundred minute movie.  It is stretched more blatantly than Zsa Zsa Gabor's face.  The result is 50-tog padding, where the running time is allowed to drag at the expense of the pace.  The tone is lost completely. Most kids' movies have a few jokes that serve as a nod to the long-suffering parents in the audience, but the `adult' jokes here suggest that Whoville has racism, infidelity and wife-swapping parties.  Unbelievable.

In place of charm, we get sentiment so cloying that tie-in sick bags would have been best-sellers.  The real meaning of Christmas isn't presents  it's about love, it's about being with friends.  The Grinch comes to realise this  an hour too late for my comatose backside  and celebrates Christmas in time for the finale.  Hooray!  We all come to realise that Christmas is about more than money and capitalism and commercialism.  The Grinch took more than 50 million dollars in its opening weekend. Merry Christmas, everybody!",literal
"Extremely violent and gory dark comedy SISU the imposible to translate Finnish word is about an old man in 1944 that tired of war decided to look for gold; find it and in his way back is intercepted but a group of defeated Nazis retreating; and decided to keep the gold from themselves.

They will not them and lots of bloody and extremely violent situations will occur.

If you seen the absurdities and comedy comedy moments of Indiana Jones and are not bothered by flying limbs, heads and lots and lots of blood; this is the movie for you.

If you are looking for a serios war movie; forget it; this not at all.

In brief; not for everybody but lots of fun.",literal
"If you forget it is made by a YouTuber this looks like a bad Tubi Original Coming out from Fantasia this was certainly an experience.

I honestly wish I had something insightful or even fun to say, but the truth is that I got nothing, because that's what this movie is, a nothing burger.

I honestly can't believe that this movie has Mike Flanagan involved, a master of slow burn horror and great series and movies like Midnight Mass, which in all it's 12 chapters of 1hr each, only had 3 jumpscares.

So why the hell does Shelby Oak's scare factor only relies on jumpscares? I thought this also came from a guy who thought the trope was overused and saturated.

Speaking of saturated, this is yet another found footage movie that looks like a budget version of Blair Witch (what a feat though, to make your movie look cheaper than Blair Witch). Watered down found footage horror that gets nowhere, ambiguity doesn't equal scary, Chris.

The main actress did a great job. I hope she does find a better movie than this slop. What a disappointment.",literal
"I wanted to like it... I love it when movies mix different genres and create a fresh spin on old themes. In this case however the different elements didn't mix well in my opinion: I would describe sinners as a mix between period gangster drama, musical and trashy B-movie horror. This sounds super exciting on paper, but in reality it threw me off completely. I feel like the movie tries to do everything at the same time but doesn't deliver on many of those aspects: It wants to hit the viewer on an emotional level but left me personally completely cold - I didn't care who died or who lived; The movie kinda wants to be scary but the ""enemies"" in the film feel like a complete joke from the first scene they are shown and it takes away all the tension; It wants to be action-packed and explosive, but the fight scenes are kinda boring and left me wanting to move on to more serious scenes again, even though those serious scenes are kind of a slow burn; The film wants to be funny and even though it made me chuckle a bit it never really took it far enough to justify sacrificing the big threat in the film for laughs.

In conclusion: This movie is too boring and slow to be an entertaining action-comedy and doesn't take the humor and fight scenes far enough to really have an impact. At the same time this movie is far too ridiculous to be a serious scary and emotional movie that reaches you on any kind of emotional level.

I would have liked it, if they would have sacrificed the humor for building a serious threat that feels genuinely scary and terrifying. The cinematography, costumes and music are fantastic but this is just not enough for me to make it a good film, when the story is not hitting. There are single parts of the movie that I absolutely loved and I would have really appreciated those scenes as standalone music videos, but it just doesn't mix well with the rest in my personal opinion.

In addition to my previous criticisms I spotted some typical clichés in the dialogue writing that made me roll my eyes and there were some moments where I found it extremely hard to believe that certain characters survived. I could go in to detail here but I want to keep my review vague to avoid spoilers.

To me watching this movie felt a bit like eating chocolate on a burger - Both elements are nice by themselves but together they don't make for a nice meal.",literal
"Endlessly rewatchable brilliance There is true magic here. Endlessly rewatchable because of the witty script and fast dialogue, incredible acting, the many hilarious as well as genuinely moving scenes, the complexity of the relationships, and the chemistry between the actors. This can cheer me up on any bad day.",literal
"So much potential lost.. Did we watch the same episode? All the reviews makes me wonder what other people see when watching series and movies. Acting wasn't bad, could have been better yes, but considering the age gap I think it was pretty decent. The cgi tho and fast paste.. and specifically the bad writing. I didn't get my hopes up for this, but when I saw the ratings I unfortunately did. The entire first episode felt rushed, kind of cringe and detached? Open to the fact that it might get better, but unfortunately not a great opening to the series in my opinion.",literal
"Interesting, but... I'm at episode 3 and the premise of this series is pretty interesting and the programmes are certainly well made with good production values, but my problem is that the main character is an utterly vile, horrible excuse for a human, and it's therefore almost impossible to engage with her. I find I'm constantly wondering why someone doesn't just kill her, and wishing that they would.

Quite where the story is going is hard to predict, but at times it feels some scenes are deliberately dragged to make the most of a set, where it would be better to just keep the story moving. Episode 3 is made up almost entirely of these unnecessarily long filler elements and really achieves very little, so why people are giving this a 10 is beyond me.

Unless you've got endless free time to fill, I'd skip this in favour of something better.",literal
"Usual Burns Quality, but... Based on episode 1, this is the usual quality production from Ken Burns & company. It's widely encompassing, human, and fascinating.

My only complaint is that I can't find a list anywhere of which actors are voicing which characters. I understand the desire to be even handed, but for me part of the fun of Burns' productions is recognizing the actors' voices. I hope this info is released soon.",literal
"Overblown romantic nonsense Predictably glossy (and shallow) Douglas Sirk remake of the 1935 film about a carefree playboy and a stolid widow brought together by chance and separated by tragedy--can he overcome the odds and make a happy ending for them both? Overblown romance elongated by foolishness, and everyone acting childishly. It's occasionally laughable yet nearly salvaged by a super-slick 1950s production-design that reeks of money. Performances by Jane Wyman and Rock Hudson (reunited the next year for Sirk's ""All That Heaven Allows"") are tolerable but do not set off cinematic sparks. A sudser for female audiences of the time, this now looks rather silly. ** from ****",figurative
"S1+2 great, S3 snoozefest Based on everyones reviews on S3 we are all in the same boat, the first 2 seasons were soo good and fresh but this season with Ed Gein is just not the same. It's slow, jumps timelines and characters too much, skips between fantasy and reality too much. I know the story from true crime and I'm struggling to keep up. If you aren't familiar with the sorry you'll have no chance of following.

They've used too much artistic license on this 3rd series, making up too much. As others said if you didn't have enough material then why did you pick old Ed as your character?

Mad I waited so long for this to be released only to be disappointed.",literal
"Die My Love tackles a difficult subject with brilliance and compassion My wife and I saw Die My Love (2025) in theaters last night. The storyline follows a young woman living with her traveling husband and their son in a small house in the middle of nowhere. As her needs go unmet and she struggles with isolation, her mental state begins to deteriorate. Can her husband and family help her, or will she spiral out of control?

This picture is directed by Lynne Ramsay (We Need to Talk About Kevin) and stars Jennifer Lawrence (The Hunger Games), Robert Pattinson (Twilight), Sissy Spacek (Carrie), and LaKeith Stanfield (Atlanta).

The writing and execution of this film are outstanding. It powerfully explores postpartum depression, the impact of isolation, and the absence of a stable support system. The film also portrays, with nuance, a husband who's trying to help but doesn't know how. Lawrence and Pattinson deliver exceptional, deeply authentic performances, and Spacek shines in a strong supporting role. As the mental health decline unfolds, you can feel how each character struggles to cope, to improve, and to hold on-even when they don't know what to do next or whether it will work. The ending serves as a perfect symbol of hopelessness.

In conclusion, Die My Love tackles a difficult subject with brilliance and compassion. I'd give it an 8/10 and strongly recommend it.",figurative
"The Gilligan's Island of Haunted Houses. Sure, the show was inspired by the British series; but after the first episode, there have been only a handful of similarities.

The ghosts are somewhat stereotypes of characters and attitudes representing the periods in which they lived and the class/genre or persons they represent. Like the characters from Gilligan's Island, they are given plots and stories allowing them to bounce off each other in a very hilarious way.

True, they lack the cruelty displayed by some of their British counterparts (a common difference between British and American comedies), but this allows the audience to like them more and to care about what they experience.

This show works. May it see many seasons!",literal
"Impecable finale If earlier episodes occasionally meandered, the finale redeems every detour. It reframes the season with an almost retroactive brilliance, making you want to rewatch earlier chapters with new eyes. It's the kind of conclusion that respects its audience's investment and elevates the entire show.

In short: The Lowdown sticks the landing-elegantly, thoughtfully, and with impeccable style.",literal
"One of the greatest childhood films ever The Sandlot is a great childhood film because it examines changes and friendship among a group of pre-teens.

Entertainment supreme, and maybe adults will like it too. A",literal
"The Actors delivered My favorite genre is horror/scary. Although there are so many subcategories. There seems to be a flood of horror, scary movies in cinemas so dreams do come true, good movies in this category! Anyway, I seldom see such a stellar group of actors who are engaged in their characters as I did in Weapons. I am happy to see Garner come back as the actor I liked (Royal Hotel, One Percent More Humid to name a couple of prior movies) due to her ability to bring nuance and a wide range of depth to her characters, including Justine Gandy in Weapons.

The movie Garner was in January 2025, had Garner's character being so one-dimensional, I wondered ""what the heck is going on"". Although some say the director is the most vital ingredient in movies, I say no, the actors are where it resides in making or breaking a movie. A good actor can catch things (many things actually) and some actors go into direct, actually a good number. Whereas those who start directing seldom make it into acting. Good actors can understand both aspects and are the most important thing to a movie. So yes I am also saying Garner missed an opportunity with the January 2025 movie, to make sure the character delivered. A character is all within the control of the actor assigned to the role, to say otherwise is not taking ownership. In Weapons Garner delivers the goods in the role for the character, as Garner has done so much and Garner is what 30 or so, quite amazing.

Just to give them all credit (yes, there are more actors in this flick, but these are the main ones).

Josh Brolin as Archer Graff, the father of Matthew, one of the missing children.

Julia Garner as Justine Gandy, a teacher who finds that almost all her class has vanished.

Cary Christopher as Alex Lilly, the only child from Justine's class who did not disappear.

Alden Ehrenreich as Paul Morgan, a police officer who has a complicated relationship with Justine.

Austin Abrams as James, a homeless drug addict and burglar.

Benedict Wong as Andrew Marcus, the school principal.

Amy Madigan as Gladys Lilly, Alex's ""great aunt"" Toby Huss as Ed Locke, the police captain and Donna's father.

June Diane Raphael as Donna Morgan, Paul's wife.

Whitmer Thomas as Mr. Lilly, Alex's loving father.

Callie Schuttera as Mrs. Lilly, Alex's loving mother.

Clayton Farris as Terry Marcus, Andrew's husband.

Luke Speakman as Matthew Graff, Archer's son and one of Justine's missing students.

Scarlett Sher as the child narrator of the film.

All these actors brought their characters alive. Great job. Yet a special shout out I have to say goes to Amy Madigan as Gladys Lilly. Honestly, I had no clue about this actor while watching this movie other than to think ""this is a master class in acting"". I am not great at names and seldom follow actors outside what I see in their movies. Madigan, as Gladys, commanded the scenes and screen, and brought such a fantastic, forceful performance while exhibiting such a range from dramatic scenes, to humor, to lighter banter. It was impressive. To not spoil anything for those who have not seen it, watch this movie for the sake of the actors and, in particular, Madigan as Gladys. Later, after leaving the movie (had to leave a little earlier, going to watch the movie again) and pulling up the characters, I discovered Madigan's accomplished acting background: impressive, as was this performance. Great job.

Brolin as Archer impressed me, as at first I thought ""don't let this be one emotional dad type full of anger"", but it wasn't and Brolin as Archer handled explaining why and where the anger was coming from and why the character was coping with the issues going on.

Gosh, I could write pages about each of these actors, their scenes, the nuances, and what a great job they all did, but that is too much for here!

Sure there are things about this flick that annoyed me (to not put out spoilers), things with scenes, script, and some other things-- due to the actors, this movie is a watch, so go watch it in the theaters!",figurative
"A disturbing view of the times Much more in the style of Beau Is Afraid than Hereditary or Midsommar, it displays the same penchant for absurdism, unexpected plot escalation, and wide thematic reach from Ari Aster. It's an entertaining satire touching on everything from Covid, social media culture, corporate greed, left/right wing politics, conspiracy theories, and cults.

One point of criticism is that it's stretched so thin it doesn't really develop a sharp point of view on any of these topics. Much like Beau Is Afraid, it feels perhaps too unfocused to have anything particularly interesting to say, at least upon first viewing. It's like a collage of all the absurdities of the 2020s with the subtitle ""yeah, things are pretty crazy out there"". It's an amusing and disturbing reflection of current times, but doesn't offer something you don't learn by just watching the news.

Much like with Beau Is Afraid, the crudeness and heightened absurdity also makes the film occasionally seem juvenile, which undermines any underlying message. Overall, it feels more like a wild rant than insightful commentary. I find that politically and socially topical movies often repeat talking points moderate audiences are already familiar with. In keeping with that trend, Eddington doesn't really add anything new to the discussion.

Maybe you tend to make sense of confusing times after the fact, not while the storm is ongoing, and that contributes to the unfocused narrative. Maybe it's too soon to offer any kind of catharsis on Covid and to provide insight into ongoing cultural crises. None of this detracts from how enjoyable the movie is, but it betrays a certain kind of confusion and immaturity coming from the filmmakers. It's a shame because Ari has already shown himself to be a great director and writer with the more reined in Hereditary and Midsommar. Even the best filmmakers need to have their worst instincts checked, though, and hopefully there is someone in Ari's circle to do that. I will credit him for being an equal opportunity offender, though. For better of for worse, it feels like there is an element of South Park in Eddington.

For the good stuff: great acting throughout (I expected nothing less with this cast), beautiful cinematography and New Mexico scenery, some wild and unpredictable plot turns. Ari is still great at building tension and has a unique voice in cinema that I will definitely come back for.",literal
"Vince,Vince,Vince..... ...I was SO hoping that you didn't jump on that Hollywood bandwagon and put out more of the cookie cutter, far out, nonsense that's being pushed on us lately. I was really hoping it was more ""real life"" content/writing like Breaking Bad or Better Call Saul. But when i saw the category was Sci-fi....i was like oh nooooo. This could be anything from A-Z (Aliens to Zombies) Aaaand there it was. Ughhh ! Hollywood is really really running out of good scripts i guess. That's lead to all these weird scenarios like this one. At first i hoped it was a virus type of show....but then it got weird......REALLY weird! And so hard to grasp without laughing. It's preposterous! And you even got on the whole ""Lesbian"" bandwagon too that seems to be a big seller right now.

"Mid-life romance set against a procedural cop drama Murder in a Small Town is my new favorite show and Rossif Sutherland has become my new favorite actor. I love the juxtaposition of a tough guy police Chief who is unsure of himself as a dad and navigating a new mid-life relationship. Love the mystery each week, but love the chemistry between Karl and Cassandra even more. Their banter is so well written and acted. The entire cast is great and the dialogue is so natural and real. I also love the relationship between Sid and Karl. The ""buddy cops"" angle adds a nice dimension to the show.

They've also had some stellar guest stars in season one. I'm really hoping it's renewed for a second season! I want to see more of Rossif and Kristin and the whole cast.",literal
"Review of The Black Phone 2 The characters were good and the story had potential, but honestly, there was way too much pointless talking. I didn't like it when the girl started flying in her dream and the masked guy made her fly-felt really cheesy. Also, when they killed the masked villain at the end, and then the guy and girl started kissing? That doesn't fit in a horror movie at all. And the ending, when the mom calls the girl on the phone to tell her she's proud of her while she's already in heaven... seriously, that was just dumb. Overall, I'd rate the movie 6/10.",literal
"not one of the better Disney's Yeah, this was not one of the better Disney animated movies I've seen over the course of my years. Probably due to the weak and occasionally obnoxious soundtrack that made getting through some of the scenes a real struggle to not turn the video player off",literal
One of My Favorite 90s Films I loved this movie growing up and still enjoy watching it occasionally. It's fun and takes me back to the way movies were before people claimed movies lacked diversity...🙄. Great film for all ages and highly recommend it.,literal
First three episodes To sum it up it started okay. Good story lines and gets pretty intense fast. The writing is not great for some characters who play obnoxious rolls. The Pennywise back story is interesting. First two episodes were okay. The third episode went down hill fast in my opinion. The whole graveyard scene was laughable. Terrible CGI and ghosts that look like Disney movie with Eddie Murphy about to pop out. Hope it gets better but ep3 was a laughable joke.,literal
"Not the Original, but Good This movie is definitely not the original. Not even close. The characters are different, the premise is different, and the game is afoot.... I mean different.

I'm okay with this. It is a great homage to the original, with head nods throughout. The action sequences were very well done, and it's good to see Michael Cera play something other than a total dweeb. Yes, there's massive social and political messages, but if that's not your thing, it's easy to overlook. The effects were tastefully done, I didn't know what would happen next, and it was a good action movie, and what more could anyone ask for?",literal

"Gets even Stranger in every season! I wasn't expecting this nostalgic TV show could be this good. In my opinion technical details in first season was not that charming but not only storyline that gets stranger, also all the technical details getting stranger.

I know first three seasons were quite the same in some ways. But the Season Four explains that situations. Not all minor things, but explains the major questions.

There is some great references to The Thing, E. T., D&D, Middle-earth and even more. That references makes ithe TV Show more exciting. Especially for geeks.

Film Editing was perfect even from the first season.

Cinematography, VFX and Sound is got better in the second season. They were a bit weak at first season.

Makeup, Costume Design, Scores, Art Direction & Set Decoration were quite good from the first season, they get a bit better along the seasons.",literal

"Great Installment I had the pleasure of seeing this as part of Secret Movie Club, and what a fun surprise! You can tell the actors and actresses were so excited to be apart of this film, and it was just good old fashioned fun. I felt the nostalgia and joy in this and come on folks you know why you are watching this sort of film. It ignites that inner child and wonder it would be to walk on an earth where dinosaurs live. I loved it! Give this a chance and know walking in that you will be entertained and feel the movies magic. Lastly, there was a part of me like ""great another Jurassic park movie"" but boy did it turn my cynical view around. Go see this and enjoy!",figurative
"Attending Anesthesiologist The Pitt is a fast-paced and emotionally engaging new medical drama that does a great job showing what it's really like to work in a busy emergency room. The show captures the intensity, the urgency, and the constant juggling act that comes with treating critically ill patients in a high-pressure environment.

What really stands out is how medically accurate most of the show is. The way they handle trauma cases, resuscitations, rapid decision-making, and teamwork under stress all feel very true to life. The medical terminology is used just enough to feel real without sounding forced, and the scenarios-from collapsed lungs to major trauma-are portrayed in a way that's both dramatic and believable. You can tell they've put in serious effort to get the medicine right.

That said, there are a few noticeable misses when it comes to sterile technique. In one scene, a full-on emergency thoracotomy is done without anyone wearing a face mask, which is a pretty big no-go in real-life medicine. There are also times when supposedly sterile gloves look way too clean after messy procedures, or when non-sterile blue gloves are used for things that definitely should be sterile. For anyone with a medical background, these moments break the immersion a bit.

Still, those issues aside, The Pitt is one of the more realistic and well-done medical shows out there right now. If you're into hospital dramas and want something that mostly gets it right, this one's definitely worth checking out.",literal
"Good but unsatisfying The film has many good elements from the cast, especially Lawrence, and the look and colour etc. The story is good while being disconcerting given the issue being dealt with. Ultimately at the end the storyline faded, tried some symbolism but then failed to deliver, and ultimately ended on an open ended moment which I felt needed clarity. The film almost had several finishing points with the actual finale leaving me a bit flat.",literal
"Undercooked Holmes and Watson Redo This concept idea was a huge risk. First, we get another unasked for updating of the Sherlock Holmes (most recently Elementary) mythos; then we also get a fairly blatant ""lift"" of the premise from House.

Those two shows had two incredible leads: Johnny Lee Miller, and Hugh Laurie.

This show has neither of those strong performers.

What we receive instead is Morris Chestnut, an actor who has a long list of short run series (Rosewood), and lengthy guest roles (The Resident, Goliath, Our Kind Of People). Chestnut seems to play dozens of variations of the same character: handsome (of course), exceptionally high IQ, superior vocational talents (detective, doctor...), a self-destructive nature, and an incredibly arrogant attitude. All of that is present here.

The production values are good, the supporting actors (most of them) have pretty faces, and the camera work is actually very good. The scripts however...those are not good. Stilted dialogue, silly coincidences, hammy melodrama, and way too many tropes and stereotypes. There's the ex-wife who Watson (Chestnut) is pining for, the young, bright, overly competitive assistants, a grimy Brit with a terrible cockney accent, and a surprise villain who is already planning a huge double cross of our hero.

And while none of that is good, the casting choice of Randall Park (Ant Man, Wanda Vision) as the new version of Moriarty is ridiculously bad. In his first scene he delivers a line that practically screams ""Muah-ha-ha-ha!"" It plays as campy (which it's Park's bread and butter), which is doubly terrible because the rest of the episode is pure melodrama and soap (one character says to Watson, ""You're so talented, you see right into people's souls).

I'd say too bad, but another Sherlock Redux after so recently saying goodbye to Elementary, is just too much.

Unfortunately there's a full 13 episode run.

Yeesh.",literal
"So far...Meh. Just saw the premier double episode, and my first opinion is just ""meh"". A few of the characters (especially Franks, ""Randy"") are so overly written and acted that they are almost cartoonish. Gibbs is stiffer than rebar, and the only trope I didn't hear was the SAC saying ""I want your gun and your badge on my desk"". The story line itself wasn't bad, just the characters.

I'd like to see it succeed, but right now, it REALLY needs work. I'd be surprised if it makes it past the first season.

I'm going to give this a few more episodes to redeem itself, but so far, this isn't really all that great. NCIS it ain't.",literal
"I expected greatness, I got mediocrity For those that have never played the game, the basic premise is that the protagonist starts in an underground fallout shelter called a vault, and through various circumstances is forced to the surface in a struggle to survive.

This show gets that part right, but it's via a poorly written story that has no coherent thought process behind it. Sure, there's a general plot that is followed in each episode. Unfortunately, the writers don't seem to want to actually tell a good story, they just want to set up individual scenes that are loosely tied together... and don't even get me started on the plethora of plot holes and inconsistencies.

On a positive note, the show does a good enough job of capturing the look and feel of the Fallout world. However, it does not seem to populate that world with all of the enemies and monsters that you would find in the game. It gives you a few ghouls and radroaches here and there, but the actual Fallout world is teeming with these, as well as an abundance of other nasties to be dealt with.

Overall, I was very disappointed with this because, as the title says, I expected greatness and I got mediocrity.",literal
"A question about end of movie? Really wonder ;) I have a question about the ending of the movie. I hope someone comments :) Do you think her mother really wrote the letter or did her father write it to make his daughter happy?

"Bad sequel (?) If you are a fan of the original predator series then this will be a very different experience. Lackluster dialogue and alright acting just destroys the already mediocre plot line.

There are some decent action scenes but a lot of the shots feel like they're from a video game.",literal
"This Year's Best or Most Overhyped Series? I wonder if I might have enjoyed Pluribus more had I discovered it organically, without all the surrounding hype.

After finishing the first episode, I found the story only mildly engaging. It seemed to lean heavily on familiar plot points from other series: an alien signal, a sudden virus outbreak, a dystopia, and the ""zombies"" (of the kissing kind). The most interesting part, the relationship between the writer and her manager, was cut short way too quickly.

Furthermore, the humor didn't quite land for me. I also couldn't shake off the feeling that the premise might have worked better as a feature film rather than a series. I attempted to watch Episode 2, but the shift in direction didn't hold my interest.

I was genuinely hopeful that Pluribus would be something special, but the excessive use of familiar, regurgitated concepts left me disappointed.

Am I alone in feeling this way?",literal
"Totally Riveting This is one of the more remarkable pieces of drama I have seen in a long time. The format of real time (1 hour is 1 hour), can sometimes be boring but not here. You really feel like you are there in that emergency room with all of the staff. You get to know the people little by little, I have watched every episode and it just gets better. It is tackling timely and controversial problems with a real world sense. I would recommend watching but non bingeing, the emotional overload would be too much. As the staff goes from patient to patient in a big city trauma center, there are moments of levity, of profound sadness and all to biting reality.",literal

"Don't bother - TERRIBLE ending! I am an avid fan of David Duchovny, and when I saw the commercials for ""Malice"", I was excited for the show to start. Watching the first episode I was not sure if I liked it or not, or if I wanted to vest my time. But, I continued watching to see what will happen, and it did start to get interesting. HOWEVER, I am VERY disappointed and angry at the way they ended the show. I won't post any spoilers here, but suffice to say, it was NOT the ending I was anticipating. I didn't expect a 'flowers and candy' ending, but at least something that would leave the audience satisfied.

"S1=9, S2=7, S3=4 S1= secret agencies, mysterious experiments, physic powers,the dark subject matter of the abuse of these subjects to exploit such powers, and the thrilling escape from these nefarious machinations.

S2= we get to explore the other world, foreboding air of danger throughout, development and growth of the gang. Similar tone as the 1st season and closes it well.

S1+S2 fits and works together.

S3=budget feels halved, core group split up for nearly the whole season, big CGI monster that looks at home in Resident Evil 2 or The Evil Within 2 video game, contrived setups , poor consistency , cheap guard costumes and lazy jokes.

Even worse thing is that they somehow made the characters flat one-note archetypes, with romances shoehorned in. It's quite sad for what S3 has turned out to be.

Guess it could be summed up as if it was made cause fans wants a new season (naturally since S1 and S2 was good) , and the producers and creators decide to chase the money that comes with that. Rather then working at it until they have something interesting to show, they just went with a hackjob of various 80s cliches.

And of course in analyzing why the drop in quality is so dramatic, we also need need to look at the pressure the suits must be pressing on the showmakers. Imagine an even greater fall in Netflix stocks if S3 was not made in time .....",literal

How hard could it be to actually build a animatronic corpse waving his hand. This whole movie is a huge disrespect to Mary Shelley. I wish i Was Lord Byron so i could fire this director. Make A real movie how hard can it be! This Director is overrated beyond all words. Why is he even famous? For what? He made one good horror movie 25 years ago. Just go watch the 90s movie with De Niro or the Mary Shelley biography instead. No cgi. Real artistic cinema. What a dissapointment A digitalised lazy movie if there ever was one.. I couldn't watch more of the movie after that ugly scene. I turned it off just because i respect the book and source material.

The only good part of this entire garbage.",literal
"A Solid Debut This film was a solid debut from Chris Stuckmann, whom I've watched since roughly 2015. And my first ever horror film, so there's probably a significant amount of inspiration Chris took in this film that I simply missed.

The story of the film is that Mia Brennan-Walker is searching for her long lost sister, Riley, who she is certain is alive despite so many people telling her otherwise. And the rabbit hole she falls down takes a sinister turn when she realizes the imaginary demon from their childhood may have been real.

The atmosphere and dread this movie builds is really well done. It's not anything groundbreaking, but it does its job well. The best sequence is the prison scene where Mia is investigating a specific cell. There are three really good jump scares there. In fact, the film has quite a few jump scares. But I would say those three in the prison are the best. The others in the film are hit or miss. Some work and some don't. I'll reiterate the prison sequence is the best sequence in the movie. The atmosphere and suspense is practically perfect.

The story itself is... okay. What works is definitely Mia and the very relatable drive to find her sister. But I can't say it's a great story in execution. There are certain problems I have like there's roughly a 10-12 year time skip between Riley's disappearance and the start of Mia's investigation. I simply find it hard to believe anybody would continue searching for that long without coming to believe the person they're searching for is dead.

Then there's the ending. The ending works for the most part, but there is a simple ""why on earth would you ever do that"" decision made that kinda brings it down. Mia finds her sister alive and being used to breed a demon called the Incubus. Where Mia finds Riley, she also finds a baby who was the center of a satanic ritual being executed by a woman named Norma, played by Robin Bartlett. In a shocking turn, Mia TAKES THE BABY HOME because it's established earlier in the story she wants to be a mother. Why the heck would you ever do something like that? You know there's gotta be something wrong with this baby, so why would you take it home?!

Well Riley tries to kill it and a scuffle happens with Mia, causing Riley to get thrown out a 2-story window by accident. She survives the fall, but not the demonic wolves that tear her apart. That's where I think Chris did an excellent job. The twist.

Earlier in the film, it's established that Mia saw the demon that had been haunting Riley during childhood, but dismissed it as a false memory or a dream. But then realized it was real when she saw it while beginning her search for Riley. Well the twist is that the Incubus had manipulated/controlled Mia into ultimately being the hand that caused her sister's death.

The entire cast really came to play. Camille Sullivan was the standout performance. Robin Bartlett was appropriately creepy and sent shivers down my spine with every scene she was in. As a huge fan of his, I wish we could've gotten more Keith David, but the one scene he was in was great and probably the right amount of screen time needed for the character.

Final Verdict: 7/10.",figurative
"Not worth it I rarely write reviews, but I feel compelled after this disappointing experience. I watched this movie solely because of the glowing reviews it had received online. Many people described it as a masterpiece, engaging, and even a ""must-watch."" Unfortunately, my experience was the complete opposite. To be honest, it felt like a total waste of both my time and money.

From the very beginning, the movie struggled to capture my attention. The storyline was flat and lacked originality. Instead of being drawn into the plot, I found myself constantly waiting for something meaningful to happen, but it never really did. The pacing was uneven, with long, drawn-out scenes that added little to the overall story. For a film that was hyped as being full of drama and emotion, it was surprisingly dull.

The characters, too, were underdeveloped and one-dimensional. I didn't feel connected to any of them, which made it difficult to care about what happened on screen. Even the performances, which some reviewers praised highly, felt uninspired and unconvincing. It seemed as though the actors themselves weren't fully invested in their roles.

Cinematography and visuals were average at best. There were a few moments where the film looked appealing, but nothing memorable or striking. The soundtrack, instead of enhancing the mood, felt generic and forgettable. For a movie that had been built up with such positive reviews, I expected a lot more creativity and impact.

Overall, I honestly don't understand how this movie received so many good reviews. It might appeal to a very specific audience, but for me, it offered little to no entertainment value. If you're considering watching it, I would recommend saving your time and money for something more worthwhile.",figurative
"Gave it a 2nd chance After the 1st episode of Ed Gein, I turned it off. After this, I came across an interview by Charlie, the actor who portrayed Ed Gein, were he explained that this was not about the things Ed Gein did, but WHY he might/ could have done them.

This changed my perspective and expectations of the journey I would led down in watching the series. With this new perspective, I found this series to be intriguing and Charlie's portrayal of Ed Gein a masterpiece.

Without seeing this interview, I would never have given the series a 2nd chance and would have missed out on this incredible series.

I challenge those who walked away to give in another chance, with the understanding it's not about the what, but the why.",figurative
"What Walt's Watching ""Good Fortune"" is not the first time Keanu Reeves has taken on a role that gets him involved in the realm of angels.

20 years ago in ""Constantine"" he was a man who could see angels and played opposite ""Gabriel"".

Now he is an angel, even if he only has small wings.

Unfortunately for angels size does matter.

""Good Fortune"" is more fantasy, comedy than the horror of ""John Constantine's"" world.

In this movie Keanu's a well-meaning but rather inept angel named ""Gabriel"" whose first mistake is meddling in the lives of a struggling worker in the gig economy ""Arj"" (Aziz Ansari) and wealthy venture capitalist ""Jeff"" (Seth Rogen).

Aziz also directed and wrote this very funny script.

Even though the life swap and body swap genre has been done to death, most recently in ""Freakier Friday"" and back in 1983's ""Trading Places"" just for starters, this feels fresh.

Listen out for: a really good mix of hits on the soundtrack

""Good Fortune"" ticks a lot of boxes for action, comedy, fantasy and romance.

Maybe trying to be all things to all people weakens this film's overall appeal.

It deals with the high cost of living and reflects the broadening gap between the haves and have nots in capitalist society today.

However, Keanu saves it with his loveable angel that falls from grace.

It's a clever directorial debut from Aziz who came to our attention last decade in ""Parks and Recreation"".",figurative
"Vivienne has worked wonders on her project Amazing extention of characters and voice actors (yes they are not the original voices from the youtube video, but they have picked amazing stars from TV, Film and Broadway to step in) especially love the cameo of a certain Helluva Boss voice actor.

Vivienne should be in reply proud of how far she has come from 2020 she dreamed big (pun intended for Facilier) much like Charlie and cannot wait for the next episodes.",literal
"Superman Soars Again I've been a die-hard DC fan for years, but let's be honest-lately they've been serving us more duds than triumphs. Superman (2025) changes that. James Gunn delivers a film that actually remembers who Superman is: not just an alien with godlike powers, but a man who's always been more human than the rest of us.

David Corenswet is the Superman I didn't know I needed. His performance channels the sincerity and warmth we haven't seen since Brandon Routh, with a presence that feels both powerful and achingly vulnerable. He doesn't brood-he cares. And somehow, that's more revolutionary than any laser-eyed battle.

But as much as this is Superman's movie, it's also Lex Luthor's. Nicholas Hoult blew me away. His Lex isn't just cartoonishly evil-he's terrifying because he's believable. Hoult plays him with an unnerving mix of cold brilliance and raw emotion, making him obscenely dynamic. One moment, you're recoiling at his cruelty; the next, you almost understand him. It's easily one of the best live-action takes on Lex we've ever gotten, and it elevates the entire film.

What really works here is the balance. Gunn's filmmaking style blends humor and sincerity without tipping too far in either direction. The comedy lands-genuinely lands-but never undercuts the weight of darker moments. The characters stay true to their cores, giving us a strange sense of nostalgia despite this being a new take. They stand shoulder to shoulder with the versions Donner gave us, making it feel like-for the first time in years-the DC Universe is finally treating its icons with respect.

Technically, the movie shines. The CGI isn't flawless, but compared to the sloppy overproduction Hollywood has been pushing out lately, it's a refreshing step up-sleek, effective, and never distracting. And thankfully, Gunn resists the current superhero trend of forcing crossovers into every frame. The story is self-contained, yet the threads it does weave (that ending with Supergirl!) had me gritting my teeth in anticipation for what's next.

The supporting cast is strong across the board, the cinematography is colorful without losing grit, and the pacing never drags. Honestly, this was one of the very few movies I didn't want to end.

Superman doesn't just revive a character. It revives an idea: that hope and kindness are just as thrilling as destruction and chaos. And after years of disappointment, that feels like a cinematic miracle.",figurative

"Beware of Season 3 The dark story is still there and it's enjoyable to watch but unfortunately I had to skip many parts in season 3. The majority of the scenes have this awful teen comedy theme with that typical annoying goofy background music that goes with the ""jokes"". They are all the same and doesn't lead the story anywhere. When you see it coming, just skip 5 minutes of the episode and you won't miss anything important.

I'm very disappointed in the direction this show has taken. 2/3 of this season is something you expect to see on a bad Nickelodeon show.",literal
"The Marksman Robert Lorenz is a director who has had a long association with Clint Eastwood.

I guess Eastwood was too old for The Marksman so Liam Neeson steps in.

Neeson plays Jim Hanson, a retired Marine marksman with money troubles. He spent his savings on his wife's medical bills who has since died of cancer. His ranch is at risk of foreclosing.

Jim comes across a couple of migrants crossing the border from Mexico. Rosa, a young mother dies. She asks Jim to her son Miguel to some relatives in Chicago.

On their tail are some Mexican gangsters, Miguel's father stole money from them and that seems a good motivation for Jim.

This is a slower paced action film. Melancholic in tone. Jim is gruff and at first reluctant to help Rosa and Miguel. Eventually Jim and Miguel strike up a rapport as the bad guys seem to be right behind them.

For a movie called the Marksman there is not much shooting from Jim. In that sense it misses the mark.",figurative
"Self Aware in the Best Way I'm sitting here after watching the finale, surprised at how bummed I am that there aren't more episodes coming soon. I enjoyed this show way more than I expected to. Glen Powell is a delight, and Perry Mattfeld is a name to keep an eye on. The best comparison I can make is a 21 Jump Street. The remake was such a bit because of how self-aware it was. Just like that, Chad Powers knows its premise is absurd. It knows it shouldn't work. And instead of trying to hide from those truths, it makes fun of itself in all of the best ways. I sincerely hope we get a second season. Until then, Catfish on me!",literal
"Need a Miracle? Good Fortune (2025) is a supernatural comedy movie written and directed by Aziz Ansari in his directorial debut and it follows a well-meaning but rather inept angel named Gabriel meddling in the lives of a struggling gig worker and a wealthy venture capitalist. This is a movie that I've seen tv spots for on YouTube, so I decided to give the movie a watch today and it was really good.

Positives for Good Fortune (2025): I have to give credit to Aziz Ansari for his work on this movie as it was an impressive directorial debut for him. This man manages to make a movie that can be both funny and charming, while having themes on what life is like for people in Los Angeles. A big part of that is the cast and the performances from Keanu Reeves, Aziz Ansari, Seth Rogen, Keke Palmer and Sandra Oh and they play their characters so well. I like how the movie gives us an angel who isn't nearly as good as he thinks he is and that he is a dumbass, but Keanu Reeves is so likeable as a person that you endear yourself to him as a character. The situation with these characters get into are hilarious to watch, while also feeling a bit realistic despite the supernatural elements. This is the type of comedy movie that we need more nowadays as it is a genre in film that isn't nearly as good as it used to be and this movie does give me some hope for the future. And finally, the pacing of the movie is really good and the story flows very well.

Negatives for Good Fortune (2025): While Aziz Ansari did a great job writing and directing this movie, there are a couple of mistakes being made along the way. There are moments where the comedy was a bit weak and forgettable. I also felt the movie was a bit rushed with the story as if it had nothing else to say towards the end. And finally, the ending was a bit underwhelming.

Overall, Good Fortune (2025) is a good directorial debut for Aziz Ansari with a good premise and a fun cast. I am looking forward to seeing what he does next as a filmmaker.",literal
"An enjoyable show, but you have to suspend belief often. It's like the other reviewers pointed out - the show's fun, the lead MC makes it work and there's enough happening in every episode to keep you tied up with their mysteries. I enjoyed the show but there are few things I'm gonna mention bc they kept bugging me.

1. The MC's voice fry. Why? Extremely annoying.

2. Her lips. What did she do to them? I couldn't take my eyes off them for most part of the series bc I know she's had some procedure done and it makes her look worse, but whatever. Beauty lies in the eye of the beholder.

3. And my biggest problem - why does she dress how Hollywood dresses a 20 something hot mess? Who shows up in a mini skirt at work, unless you're a stripper? Why does nobody ask her to dress more formally? More importantly, as someone with a 160+ IQ, shouldn't she have the common sense to not only NOT dress as a 20 year old, but to at least cover her legs when she's around dead bodies???? She has to constantly do things like squatting, bending, jumping and what not, and you want me to believe this highly intelligent woman CHOOSES to wear an uncomfortably short and tight mini skirt (with heels, no less) Every. Single. Time?

The remainder of the cast was pretty basic and had no depth to it, including the strong and independent but slightly annoying teenage girl who does what she wants but is a pure virgin bc for whatever reason, despite Hollywood being soooo sex positive, teenage girls having sex is still a no-go for them. It's honestly a tired trope at this point.

The ex-husband also makes no sense. He has no animosity towards the MC, he's available at every beck and call of hers, drops everything to make time for her demands....... so why are they divorced??? It's never really explained. It would have been better if that character was instead the MC's sister or gay brother.",figurative
"A good introduction to a hidden aspect of Japanese culture Brendan Fraser plays an American actor who has been living in Tokyo for 7 years. His career has not been a success, doing things like toothpaste commercials. A chance gig has him connected with Rental Family, a business that rents out fake family members, friends, apologetic mistresses, etc. There are roles that specifically require a white man. His 1st official task is to play bridegroom, getting married to a young woman, who then can leave her family, ostensibly to go with him to Canada, but in fact for her to be with her lesbian lover.

In between other short-term roles, a couple of several-weeks continuing roles come up. One is to be a friend to an aging actor, under cover of being a journalist who wants to write his life story. Another is to play the long-lost father of a young girl, whose mother is trying to get into a good school, but believes that a single parent will not be acceptable. In both cases, the hiring client is not the subject of the relationship, so his acting skills are called upon. However, he gets emotionally attached, and complications ensue.

I saw this film at the World Premiere series of screenings at Toronto International Film Festival, with director Q+A. It seems that rental families are a real business in Japan, especially in Tokyo, where people are lonely, and psychotherapy is not easily available and socially disdained. Some businesses specialize in particular aspects, while others (like in the film) are generalists. Also, there are shrines around Tokyo, where, for a small offering, strangers can go to pray and meditate.

The situations are heartfelt, and Fraser does a good job playing the actor who is conflicted by playing a fake role in real people's lives. Recommended for those who are interested in a glimpse of the underbelly of Japanese culture.",literal
"The Girl with the Canadian Accent Bonkers - sometimes in a good way, sometimes in a ""God, this is annoying"" way but overall, Seasons 1 and 2 are pretty good, even if they require suspension of disbelief.

Season 3 is where Absentia falls off a cliff, as the quality of writing takes a nose dive to the level of ""nonsensically, unwatchably bad"". It's truly terrible, in every way.

Each season is artificially stretched to 10 episodes, which can be frustrating to wade through at times.

The female protagonist has absurd powers of recovery, both physical and mental. In S3, she turns into a comic book superhero.

These must be the most unprofessional, poorly trained FBI agents in modern history. The character of Nick is poorly written - hard to be believe anyone is that feckless, though thinking of some former work colleagues maybe it's not so unrealistic.

The accents across all seasons can be variable - Stana is frequently blatantly Canaaadian, eh? Some of the Brits have flawless American accents, that slip only once or twice.

In S1, best to turn on the subtitles and leave them on - one character in particular is unintelligible.

Very good production values, even if the filming locations are very obviously not American.

Good cinematography - dark, moody, washed out colours. In S3, it goes overboard though and it's never daytime - just a permanent shade of brown sepia. Yet another reason to hate S3.

Watch S1 and S2, then spare yourself the agony of S3. Gets a 7 rating out of goodwill for the first two seasons.",literal
"I love it Its pretty much bi-polar. in one half hour episode i go from like pissing myself laughing to wanting to cry to cringing about 7 times an episode. 

I mean seriously Laura Linney is one of the best actresses i've seen in a TV series for a long time. The characters have such complex relationships which would be too much for a 90 minute film but is great for a TV series. 

So i guess overall I love this so much. its my new favourite programme. It makes me sad that she's gonna die. I hope they get a few series out of it first.",literal
"Only The Designs Shone. The Story Was A Rushed Flop The theme of Kpop girls hunting with flashy swords is certainly appealing. Due to all the hype and praise, I watched this film with pretty high expectations.

But let's just say I was quite disappointed with how everything was executed. Downvote me all you want, but you glazers need to stop acting like this movie is the second coming of Christ.

PLOTHOLES

The details about the demons and honmoon were incredibly vague. It left me hanging and wondering why nobody in the public knew anything about demons. The people in the movie are like PLEBIANS - they do nothing but brainlessly worship the popstars. There are only three people who can fight the demons, and nobody addresses this?

How did Rumi's parents marry? Was her mother evil? Why is nothing explained about all the powers and stuff?

CHARACTERS

Rumi, Mira and Zoey get to eat whatever they want, and they get mad at Bobby for interrupting their gluttonous ""snacktime"". They also live in a most fancy building, and that means they're very rich for no reason.

Yep, that's the lifestyle of the three-girl band, which makes them extremely unrelatable. Zoey was downright annoying and overly quirky, and Mira just existed to make the dynamic more practical between the three. Rumi believed herself to be defined as a peice of s**t just because she had marks, and it was somewhat cringe. Like yes, characters can have struggles, but there's NO need to overdo them.

Let's talk about the villains, aka the Saja Boys. The majority of the members are just there for fanservice. They are so detached from the story, and even Jinu wasn't given proper attention. They tried to model his backstory like Demon Slayer's backstories, but again, there was not enough detail. Rumi's relationship with Jinu was rushed and forced, with things happening too fast to feel natural. I get it that this movie is only 1.5 hours long, but still! Jinu said Rumi gave him his soul ""back"", but there's no way this freaking random girl who doubts herself to hell can remove his remorse over abandoning his family. It makes no sense.

The song 'Golden' needed a nice story behind it, because otherwise it just feels like some self-glorifying song. It popped right up at the beginning and wasn't a meaningful product made in the middle of the film, which made it somewhat shallow.

THE ENDING

Was. Awful.

Gave me My Little Pony vibes. Any of you remember Cadence and Shining Armor's romance part? How they flew up into the air together and remade the shield, which kicked Queen Chrysalis out? Boy that was sooooo similar.

Everything at the end made no sense, and it sounded like the producers were running out of ideas. Rumi was able to kill Gwi-Ma in one stroke, and Jinu was able to save her with his body, just like that? Weird, weird!

Everything was just thrown down like that - the Saja Boys were killed, and Jinu alone was portrayed as ""somewhat good"". So, are demons evil, or not? The message is muddy and poorly delivered.

POSITIVE THOUGHTS

The costumes were elaborate and pretty, and ""Takedown"" wasn't a bad song at all. Rumi wasn't a perfect protagonist which is good, and I am happy she and Jinu didn't get the cliche, unrealistic pair-up everybody wants. Overall this film is enjoyable for kids.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This movie should have been much longer. Th characters were not fleshed out enough, and the million-air status of the Huntrix members managed to estrange me from connecting to them. Sony tried to incorporate a lot of things into this movie, but it was too fast-paced, undetailed, and morally smudged. All hiding under the pretty image of Rumi and Jinu.

NEVER TRUST THE HYPE, GUYS! PEOPLE SHOULDN'T GLAZE IT JUST BECAUSE OTHERS ARE DOING IT.

DON'T BE LIKE SHEEP GOING OVER A CLIFF!",figurative
Thank you! You have been in our lives for 11 years. Thanks to all of you.,literal
"Was this a Christmas movie parody? I sort of liked the premise of the movie, it had some good potential. But somehow they failed terribly to give any Christmas spirit or good movie experience. The terrible acting, unrealistic characters and strange cutting of the movie left me constantly questioning weather this was an actual attempt at making a feelgood movie, or if it is a parody movie like Scary Movie and Disaster Movie (that would actually make more sense). And even if it is a Christmas movie parody, it fell flat.

I did, however, find myself chuckling a couple of times, and I liked Jameela Jamil and how she portrayed her obnoxious character.",literal
"Not run of the mill I'm not sure what some people have watched, but there is truly some rubbish out there on tv at the moment, but this is not that. It has a decent story, intrigue, excellent cast and is well written. I was able to suspend my disbelief, was caught up in what is going to happen next. Here's hoping the following episodes are even better,",literal
"Total disappointment I am probably one of the few who actually read Stephen King's book, the one this movie was based on. After reading this excellent work, I could not wait to see the movie version of it. After viewing the movie, I was TOTALLY disappointed. The only thing that this movie has in common with the book is the title and the names of the characters. In the book, Schwarzenegger's character is put on a game show. The main object is to survive. But he's not in an arena. He's set loose in the city and has to escape the game show's (I guess you'd call them) villians, who bear absolutely no resemblence to the movie characters. This premise built much tension and suspension and ended greatly with the climax. The movie was absolute garbage. There was no cinematic quality to it. I totally respect Arnold Schwarzenegger as an actor, but he messed up with this one.",literal
"Compelling with outstanding performances This is a well told story of a little known part of the Nuremberg trials. It holds your attention right from the off with a well paced script and outstanding performances throughout.

Of course there is a little bit of artistic licence but if I want 100% historical accuracy I would read a book or watch a documentary. As a drama though this works very well.

Using some b&w imagery to give more of a sense of the time, in the trial scenes when actual archive footage of the holocaust is used it all adds to the sense of watching something from the time.

There is one small aspected that irked me a little bit where certain characters are given some dialogue to shoehorn some facts and timeline. It felt a little bit as though the audience weren't trusted enough to know some basic facts. That may well be true but I doubt those people wouldn't be in the audience anyway.

That aside it is a very very good film. What makes it stand apart though are the performances from Russell Crowe and Rami Malek in particular. Michael Shannon also shines and although a smaller part there is one scene in particular where Richard E Grant stands out. I would not be surprised to see award nominations coming soon.",figurative
"Not bad, but too much Marvel I will start with saying that I'm not the biggest fan of Cavill's and Snyders Superman attempt.

I heard that this portrayal would be more hopeful and comic accurate.

With that said, this was definitely not a dark take on the man of hope.

BUT it brought something to the table that we've already seen Marvel do since the first Iron man.

It was too much a goofiness mess.

If it would have come 20 years ago, this would have been awesome. Instead it brings us a movie that feels a little tiresome and uncreative.

We've been OVERFED with these movies the last 20 years....😔 It's more a ""Justice Gang"" movie (yes, that's what they call themselves here), than a Superman movie.

And this Justice ""gang"" movie reminds me more of Guardians of the galaxy than Justice League.

I like the adoption of Krypto (the dog), but it became too much.

Krypto reminded a lot of a dog version of Groot in GotG. In fact, a lot of the characters had a similar character in Guardians of the galaxy.

This felt a little lazy and uncreative.

On the other hand... As a Guardians of the galaxy movie, it was good.

Colors, lighting, angles, CGI, jokes and even music felt like it came directly from Gotg, and in that type of movie it works.

Unfortunately Superman made me miss Reeve's Superman more.

If I would take Gunn's and Snyder's Superman and throw it in a blender, the result would be awesome.

They both fell a little too far in each ditch.

Gunn's is too silly and Snyder's is too depressing.

I like this one for what it is, but I'm also wishing for a new remake.",literal
"It starts well, gets better, but then they just try to milk out as much as possible This show was supposed to end a long time ago. Main actors started to leave and the plot doesn't really get better (or even stays the same) without them. Like, really, Fiona's actor, which was arguably the ""main main character"" of the show, left the show and they just kept going.

Most original characters are really well made and likable (Debbie being the one I have a bit of an issue with), but the problem with shows that have this is that, when you remove them, it loses substance. It lost its substance, I didn't feel interested on rebooting the story because the show was interesting by its story, not by its setting necessarily.

Props for the Ian & Mickey relationship though. I just love the chemistry and realness those two have together. Not even touching how important that is to be shown on television as we go into the ""being gay or not is normal and everyone should accept it"", which is a really good message as well.",figurative
"Breath of fresh air! I have REALLY enjoyed watching this! Quite honestly it's a breath of fresh air against every other show that's coming out right now, in my opinion. No, it's not super serious, it's just FUN. There's some humor, fluff, ridiculousness, etc. And to me, the chaos of it really works. At the end of my incredibly full and busy days, to sit down on the couch and watch something that has a bit of mystery and surprise to it is really great. I won't give it away, but I haven't had such an authentically raw outburst of laughter in a LONG TIME... and the scene with Carol Burnett speaking to Kristin Wigg in the delacortte mansion had me snorting and I even replayed the scene. Is it cinematic gold? Perfection? NO. But honestly the intrigue of each episode and dramatic ironies at play, mixed with the 1960s backdrop and exciting wardrobe is the perfect cocktail hooking me in. Give it a try with an open mind. Without being stuffy and judgmental. I hope you too will feel refreshed as I did.",figurative
"Nostalgia is the best part Its cheesy, even more so than the first. The first half of the movie was kinda painful to get through but a bit past halfway it starts to get more enjoyable and it begins to really hit the nostalgic feel. Im so glad they played the pink slip song, but on that note I would have loved a bigger roll from her old friends. They're hardly in it and then only really show them for the song. I also wish they would have focused harder on that song as that was the best part of the movie for me. It was good but not great.

Watched at AMC on 8-11-2025.",literal
TWO WORDS.....PETER DINKLAGE .....BOOM! 💣 Episodes 1-4....enjoyable. Episode 5 and the addition of Peter Dinklage takes this to a another level! The chemistry between Dinklage and Hawke is inspired. The back and forward banter is hilarious and they complement each other perfectly! This series is fresh and different amongst all the generic and formulaic shows that come and go. I sincerely hope it's got legs and sticks around!,literal
"A Weird but Fascinating Start Watched the first episode - bizarre in the best way. What starts as a simple office accident quickly spirals into a surreal mystery packed with awkward humor and unease. Tim Robinson perfectly balances frustration, paranoia, and comedy. A weird but fascinating start that definitely kept me curious for what's next .",literal
"One of the best Netflix show. Stranger Things as a whole is one of the best shows I have seen so far. First three seasons have been exciting and stunning but season 4 is extraordinary 👌🏻. The Duffer Brothers knock it out of the park for what I believe that this series is one of the best netflix series so far. There are so many twists and turns and it had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. This is one of the most addicting series that I have ever watched. I love the characters so much! The storylines and characters are so fleshed out and watching it gets me emotional and millies acting is superb. Can't wait for season 5.

From me 10/10 rating for this masterpiece❤.",figurative
A very clever show It is a brilliant show. Breaking bad audiences should tune into it. Alot of fans might find it slow at the start but each season does get better and better. I would recommend this show to everyone specially to breaking bad fans.,literal
"It lost something in the translation. I read the book Mr. And Mrs. American Pie late last year and didn't know that Palm Royale was based on it. As I began watching the first episode, I wondered about it feeling a bit familiar. Reading the credits confirmed that it is LOOSELY based on the novel. The tone, at least, if not the actual story. It's like promising you creamy delicious vanilla ice cream and then giving you gritty overly artificial froyo. Is Kristen Wiig good in the lead? Yes. Are the rest of the cast above average. Absolutely. It's just not the story from the original novel and sometimes I wonder why they use the book at all if most of the really interesting elements are whittled out.

I'm three episodes in and struggling to stay with it. It's lost some heart and while Maxine is always a challenging character to truly like, this version is truly hollow. I haven't found anything redeeming in this adaptation. It's a fine watch for Wiig fans but ultimately mediocre in story telling and structure.",literal
"Good movie If you like Niam you will like this movie. There is good action, and the movie is well produced.

The story is also good and entertaining. Not very original, but nice and clean entertainment.",literal
"Right on the money Exactly what you're looking. Tulsa King delivers. Stallone hits the mark with a brooding no nonsense performance that blends humor and violence to near perfection.

The classic fish out of water scenario is well played. And the first episode does a great job at setting up what looks like a stellar cast. Right from the start the plot begins to weave together. Frankly I was pleasantly surprised.

We'll see how the season unfolds but so far it's a great change of pace from some other series debuts lately. There's no cgi to be sure. Just great characters, authentic dialogue, a smart story, and a first class cast.",figurative
"what a life The award-nominated writers of SING SING, Greg Kwedar and Clint Bentley, have now upped their game even more with TRAIN DREAMS, this time with Bentley directing. It has a similar theme of the beauty and unpredictability of humanity and the world itself. Based on a novella by Denis Johnson, this is a character study of Robert Grainier (Joel Edgerton), a logger working on a railroad in 1917. He's stoic, a hard-working man with a wife (Felicity Jones) and daughter to take care of. He's a man of few words, but he's thoughtful, looking for purpose in life. Usually, having a narrator could be seen as a crutch, but it's done so well here, voiced by a smooth but powerful Will Patton. He gives us more insight into Robert and the world around him. The movie touches on discrimination during the ""Great War"", but its main focus is Robert and how the world changes around him. The process of building a railroad represents both destruction and progress. Chopping down trees, then making the world smaller by building railroads. It also focuses on Robert's workmates, one played by William H. Macy. His role is very small, but this might be the best he's ever been. Speaking of ""best he's ever been"", freakin Joel Edgerton. This man does so much, with little dialogue. It's an award-worthy performance on top of an already awesome career. Humanity's complicated relationship with nature is another theme here. Overall, this is a poetic meditation of America, about the ups and downs of one life among many. I had the privilege of seeing TRAIN DREAMS in a sold-out theatre, and I can't wait for you to see it when it comes to Netflix on November 21. I know this review is early, I just had to put something out there about it. Put it on a list, make a reminder, don't pass this one by when it finally releases!",literal
"A must watch for any drama enthusiast If you are a fan of GOT, Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, etc. This show is a must watch. The themes throughout are very dark but go beyond that of your typical mob show. While every character has some problem you find a way that they are relatable. The writing and acting truly bring the story to life and make you feel as if you are apart of the show. There is lighthearted moments in the gruesomeness of the show that you will find yourself laughing at showing the genius of the writing.

The ending is by far the best conclusion of any show I've ever seen. Well worth your time to watch and an easily rewatch able show. This was my first time watching but many people I have talked to have watched through multiple times.",literal
"Characters Likeable Any show has to start developing characters at first and if you like them or care about them you stay to watch. The show has likeable characters and they are just getting started. The chief is being developed quicker than the deputies, but you have hints of information that will be developed in later episodes. The daughter is coming along slowly as well for later episode development.",literal
"Whiny, Immature characters; every ONE OF THEM Past the first season, only because of my wife. The mother, Lorelei, looks like a deranged bunny rabbit, and she only eats pizza and chips and sweets. She pouts and runs away when things don't go as she planned. Her only daughter, Rory is just as bad. So each episode they trade the baton as to whom will be the most and biggest crybaby. They both act as if they are ten years old. Rory's grandmother is a wealthy harpie who wants everything and yet gives nothing, except to Rory. Lorelei's father is all business, well-meaning, but distant as the North Pole. This show is aggravating to watch at forty-five minutes each. Every female talks exactly the same way. The quips fly by at a blinding pace but only a few of them make any sense within the context of the story/conversation. So if you like vapid characters who are as thin as tissue paper (even though they eat only junk food every meal) then this insipid show is for you.",literal
"Amputated Alien This Superman is fragile, sensitive and mutilated. Understandably, this reboot of the franchise aims to give us a superhero we can relate to, one with social and political relevance. But all those good intentions stray too far from the essence of what makes Superman iconic. Much of the film shows him in one battered situation after another. At first, this vulnerability is refreshing, but over time, it becomes emotionally draining, to the point of fatigue.

David Corenswet delivers a charming and earnest Superman, but the script gives him little room to explore the depth and complexity the role deserves. The visual effects, while competent, lack the creative spark needed to elevate this film above the countless superhero entries that have come before it. Storytelling is uneven and, at times, unfocused, as the film tries to juggle too many ideas at once.

Krypto is genuinely endearing but can't carry the entire film on his adorable little body.

It's perfectly fine to give us a flawed, grounded superhero brimming with quiet goodness. But this ""alien"" feels too amputated, to the point that we can no longer recognize the Man of Steel.",literal
"Insane cinematography! Absolutely stunning world design paired with probably Marvel's best ever cinematography. The cast did a great job too.

The CGI was pretty impressive throughout the movie except for one 'small' character. The CGI baby was very poor, which impacted an important scene.

The movie repeats some old Marvel tropes which makes the plot a bit predictable at times. I feel like Galactus could have been more menacing as well.

But still: it's the most beautifully shot Marvel film ever with a wonderful cast. Very enjoyable. 7/10.

Overall, a very decent Marvel film! I liked it!",literal
"Death becomes her.. Have seen bits & pieces over the years,but finally in two days watched it all.

I did enjoy this although clichéd,not original or unique.

Feel as though topics like this,are almost romanticized in shows.. It did cover serious moments,but yet also glossed over it.

Oh sure nobody watches a show to escape & end up being depressed,in this case you know the overall story.. So,keep it real.

Many episodes felt choppy,where you don't get a smooth transition/closure between episodes.. I know this might of been done to keep the series from becoming longer than four seasons,but it affected feeling connected to the characters or their situations.

Thoughts: Why didn't Lee greet her versus random boat guy,upon opening the door after she died? Was the therapist Cathy seeing dead or in her imagination? Also hate when they switch actors playing roles,like they did with Cathy's dad.

Did anyone feel,season 4 was rushed? Like they needed to end the series,but was only given limited episodes to accomplish it?

Actors to acting was fine,cinematography & soundtrack decent.

Would of enjoyed if the locations was Minnesota,instead of pretending.

Worth seeing if you haven't,one day might rewatch it.",literal
"Could be better Agree that each episode feels like a romanticized, hallmark version of a murder mystery, which is funny b/c Hallmark does an excellent job with film adaptations of Charlaine Harris' Aurora Teagarden novels. Part of the problem may be trying to condense a full-length novel into a one-hour television show. Another is characterization; the Teagarden movies tend to stick more closely to the way characters were portrayed in Harris' novels. And weak chemistry between Alberg and Cassandra doesn't help.",literal
"So REFRESHING You can tell the creators really put the work in. The photography, the music, the cast.

Season 1 was funnier but weirder sometimes, but very entertaining.

Season 2 was just beautiful, the plots so good, the acting.

And a detail worth mentioning, not much ideology involved, and when it was, you had counter arguments as well from other carachters, so a healthy trade of ideas. Not preaching at all.

Set in a tropical resort, it follows the exploits of various guests and employees over the span of a week.

"Miscast lead... Wayward has just enough intrigue and mystery to make you binge it across the finish line, but still kinda underwhelming once you reach there. Like others have pointed out, the lead actor Mae Martin is just not on the same level as the other actors. When you have pros like Toni Collette and Sarah Gadon supporting, you really need to up your game, its not that Martin is bad (they were great in Feel Good), just very one-note, always this deer in the headlights expression. I know Martin was the creator of the story, but they should of given Alex's role to a more accomplished actor. I thought the rest of the cast were good to great, standouts being the 2 girls that portrayed Abbie and Stacey. I've always been a sucker for these weird mysterious tales, and also very forgiving for plotholes, however this one was kinda disappointing, especially with all the talent involved. Enjoyable in flashes while it last, but i will have forgotten everything in a few weeks....",literal
"Cruisy Road Film Follows the usual beats of a Neeson film, just a bit less action. None the less I always enjoy watching him on screen. Some of the shots he takes with his rifle skills is awesome. The filming looks really nice and all in all it's a pretty cool film.",literal
"Reality My favorite actor is Billy Bob Thornton acknowledging the wide range of characters he plays. In this series, he is incredibly believable and addresses life in a real, hard working way. While his character lies in question, he seems to have two loves, his crazy selfish wife and doing whatever it takes to get the job done. This show outlines how the reality of oil versus the environment and the flow of money that is revolving within. It is entertainment and reality at its finest!",literal
"Season 3 is garbage Season 1, awesome. Season 2, not bad. Season 3, complete garbage.

Just like many others here, I have to agree that Season 3 was a complete disappointing mess. Henry Cavill is awesome but he gets lost in terrible writing as opposed to earlier seasons when he was part of a captivating story.

There's no doubt he read season 3 and thought, ah geez, I guess I have to stick this out because of my contract but then I am so outta here. There's also no doubt that the writers and production will leave this off their resumes.

Such a pity as I looked forward to binge watching this season but now I won't even bother with part 2.",figurative
Shades of Grey I miss Alex in Pediatrics. Miranda as a strong leader. April in the ER. Cali breaking bones. Meredith and two young guys is unrealistic. Give her a mature man that respects her and her kids and allows her time to operate and research. That's what a tired single mom of 3 really wants. When did this stop being a medical drama and become a soap opera entitled the Weber/Averys standing around talking about a tumor for several episodes. Give me some more medicial drama and less standing around talking. Less grey more Gray!!,literal
"Not that impressive Let me start by saying that I am not trying to start a fight or insult anyone, just expressing my own opinion. It's very hard for me to get into new shows as I find them quite repetitive; to me, ""Breaking Bad"" was no exception.

I don't know or understand how this show got so many 10/10 reviews. I have to agree the writing was good, but after a while I found a lot of it redundant. It was simple- two guys manufacture meth, they need a distributor, the find a distributor,their partnership goes sour with their distributor, they find a way to kill their distributor, rinse, repeat....add in a little moral questioning, some bromance and there you have it- how to write ""Breaking Bad.""

Personally speaking (again), I found shows like Nip/Tuck (though far more far-fetched)a great deal more interesting and creative than BB.

Again, just my opinion.",literal
"A hard pass! The film presents a perplexing paradox of quality, where the performances barely scrape by with passable, albeit uninspired, acting that might be generously described as B-grade. Unfortunately, this visual splendor is grievously undermined by the script, which plummets to the depths of F-grade writing. The cinematography in the film is decent, managing to deliver clear and coherent visuals that serve the narrative without much flair.

The narrative is beleaguered by scenes that strain credulity, eliciting more winces than awe with their cringe-inducing execution and frustrating lack of realism. This film falls squarely into the trap of the typical American crime drama that rides the wave of hype but ultimately fails to deliver any meaningful substance, leaving the audience yearning for what could have been.

TLDR: Mediocre acting, with decent cinematography but cringe-worthy writing. A hard pass.",literal
"Aimless, Pointless, Cartoonish, Confusing You will walk out of this theater wishing you had the last 2 hours and 25 minutes of your life back. The first hour just drags, and you can tell it isn't building to something. There are so many loose ends, and reality breaks when Sheriff Joaquin Phoenix is slapped twice with multiple witnesses and does nothing respond with immediately arresting the slapper, it only goes more off the rails from there, it ends in so surreal a place you will spend the last 30 minutes thinking 'this must be a dream, right?' Only for it to be real in the Universe of the movie. Pedro gives an excellent performance, Joaquin makes some choices, and Emma seems well-directed, but the script is terrible and the editor is worse.",figurative
"Season 5 ugh This show is great at keeping your attention, it's moves fast and the acting is great. However in the there are even more flashbacks, which personally gets on my nerves. I understand why someone would be interested in how Smurf came to be, but it's much too distracting for me.",literal
"The meaning of Super-Hero This movie is incredible. It was able to fully capture the essence of Superman, or at least the one I like the most.

I love how Clark acts, just trying to do good and always gets in deep trouble because of it. His mere existence causes trouble, but he doesn't mind. He keeps flying around and helping people, doing what he can to save others. It's inspiring.

Lex Luthor was the second best thing in this movie. He's a villain, a Super-Villain. The lengths in wich he'll go just to destroy Superman is comically evil and it's incredible because of that. Like the monkeys spreading hate on the internet. That still cracks me.

The movie is quite comical too, with a humor that I found really enjoyable.",literal
So good! This show is honestly so good! I rarely get into new shows because they just don't hold my attention. The writing and chemistry in this show is amazing! This show has such an amazing romantic comedy. The romance isn't cheesy or overdone it feels like a real romantic story coming to life. It is just so well done and enjoyable to watch. I put it on thinking I would just start the show and watched the whole season in one sitting. Also super thankful this show was released fully instead of having to wait! I really cant recommend this show enough and if the review isn't enough having Kristin Bell and Adam Brody should be enough of a sell!,literal
"Powerful. I LOVE this film. Unlike most Disney female leads we have had in the past, Moana is a leader. She is strong and brave. This film did not need a love interest despite it having a female lead which is quite refreshing. The songs are catchy, the animation is realistically beautiful, and it shows the importance of family and community very well.",literal
"May we all get what we want and never what we deserve Animal Kingdom is a well-crafted story with a great cast and exceptional writing. Without a doubt, this series is the best TV series about organized crime to date, even better than The Sopranos, because let's face it, The Sopranos just looks dated when giving it a rewatch.

Ellen Barkin gives the performance of her lifetime on this hit show as Janine ""Smurf"" Cody, the matriarch of the Cody family. The other cast members really grow into and evolve their parts as a family of well-trained criminals, con artists, liars, thieves, and murderers. While watching the high-tech heists and the planning that goes into it is highly entertaining, this series' strength is in character development and the solid story-telling of a highly dysfunctional family that sticks together, with some exceptions along the way. One of the most interesting parts of the show is Smurf's sons complicated relationship with her. The show is set in sunny Oceanside, Californa, providing a sunny and breezy backdrop to the fast, furious, hip, hot, sexy, and dangerous vibe.

Each season keeps you captivated, and while the show seemingly hit its peak at the end of Season 4, I thought Season 6 came in strong and ended strong. As for the negative reviews about the flashbacks, I found them to be a nice addition to the show, and if you watch the show to the series finale, you will see that they were needed to support the brilliant ending.

This show is not only worth a watch from beginning to end, it's also worth a rewatch!

Update March 2024: One final note as I'm rewatching it for a third time. Is this show realistic and characters authentic and relatable? Probably not. I mean the cast is as sexy as you can get on TV so that's probably not very realistic when it comes to a show about a crime family in America today. But what this show has done is deliver the best storytelling about crime and complex family dynamics that I have seen since The Sopranos. And, those familiar with me or my other reviews would know that, above all else, I hold the story as paramount! Thus, I'm updating my rating from a 9 to a 10.",literal
"gone downhill What happened to one of the greatest animes ever made, season one was a masterpiece it had everything, great action, great comedy amd animation was amazing. The writer seems to have forgotten what made this series such a masterpiece in the first place. I really hope season 3 doesnt dissappoint",figurative
"A chaotic mess! Oh my god, where to even begin! I wanted this to be good so much and I was super excited to see it, but it's very clear this was written by talentless people with absolutely no storytelling skills and TikTok brains, it was a complete mess. They took everything that made the first film good - like character development and a simple but engaging storyline - threw it out the window and just made everyone scream, act erratic and all of the background characters barely noticed a thing. And it tried so hard to be funny but the jokes didn't land. I won't say any more as don't want to write spoilers, just know this is NOTHING like the original.

Do yourself a favour, sack this film off and just stick with film no.1. No idea what planet people who rate this a 10 are living on, it's an utter calamity.

WHY! 😂😫😂",literal
"The Book was excellent... this series good. I loved the book and enjoyed the series for the most part. But they changed way too much from the book. In the book the brother was not disabled so the whole storyline involving the brother bothered me. In the book Carrie's mom plays a big role and she is completely different in the series. A lot of other characters that are important in the book are not in the series and vice versa. It was an entertaining show, but nowhere near as good as the book.",literal
"Good and entertaining I've watched the whole show and i liked it a lot, it was entertaining and kept me interrested until the very end. Stana Katic did an amazing job and the rest of the cast did fine as well (most of the time). Its suspenseful, mysterious, dark and keeps you guessing till the end... The concept is great!

Is it the best show of the year? No, i dont think it is. Are there flaws and problems with the plot at times, yes of course there are... But this would've have been my answer to most TV shows. I don't think the 4 star ratings (or lower) are fair, you may not like it, but it's not THAT bad. If they were able to get some of the small details right, yes it would've been an even better show, but it is still good. Some people are complaining about it not being realistic (accents wrong, clothing wrong, etc.). I mean it is TV so you will always find these problems. I didn't mind it and i didn't see any major unrealistic things (maybe thats just me, because i don't really care about it). I would definitely say its worth a shot! Try 1 or 2 episodes and go see for yourself if you like it. If not, then not. But you should definitely try.",literal
Don't waste your money The Marksmen is clearly a mere political stab at Trumps border policies in a poor attempt to get the audience to feel sympathy for illegal immigrants. It lacks any real substance and the storyline goes absolutely nowhere. The characters all provide nothing to relate or feel emotion towards with almost every line being bland and/or cliche. Don't waste your money or time on this poor excuse of a movie.,literal
"Comfort show Picking up this show may as well have been the best decision i've made in my entire life. A show i wasn't expecting anything from turned out to be everything i was looking for. Interesting plot, brilliantly written characters that are neither good nor really ""bad"" people, tons of hilarious moments but also a good share of ones that would have you tearing up. Characters that no matter how much you despise are indispensable to the show. The relationships between them - the dynamics, all the hardships that they go through. This show is so much about finding the silver linings. All these characters are constantly facing with poverty - and the show does an amazing job at showing how hard it is to break out from it and from your roots.

I took my sweet time watching this show. A year and a few months to finish it, which probably isn't a long time for 11 seasons... Not because i found some episodes boring, but because i wanted to savour these moments for as long as possible. I came back to it every once in a while, for me it is an extremely comforting show (maybe it's how the gallaghers function, their dynamic, everything), even though it does not lack moments that can make you cry.

I would say i wish i can forget the show so i can watch it all over again, but i'd do it anyway, remember it or not.",figurative
"What did I just watch Stupidity from beginning to end. I can't remember the last time a movie actually made me angry. I was actively rooting for the characters to die. How did a 60+ft dinosaur hide in 5ft of grass? An, entire security system completely disabled by a Snickers wrapper?

I should have walked out the minute Scarlett Johansson's character said ""I can guarantee your safety"" because there are six previous movies that tell us you most certainly cannot.

I honestly hope that this is the end of the franchise.

I saw this for free with Regal Unlimited, and I still want my money back. Everyone involved in the production should be ashamed of themselves.",literal
"Falls apart Like many have said this series started with promise, but when downhill with each episode. Ridiculous scenarios, a million plot holes, and an ending that leaves a lot to be desired.

I always enjoy Jason Bateman, and I think he was fine as the degenerate loser Vince. Jude law was not as god as the obnoxious, phoney Jake. The rest of the cast was mostly subpar, especially the British rapper or pop star or whatever he was Wes.

The main plot wouldve been fine, but as per usual it seems these days the writers opted for ridiculous scenarios and decisions to amp up the action.

No gangsters operate like this and Jake, a pretty successful guy makes the dumbest decisions imaginable.

Also glorifies casual drug use as whatever, even when a chick that works at the bar od's and has to be shot up with narcan, it's like no big deal, she wake up with a hangover.

Not really much to see here.",figurative
"Yes indeed -- Quality held in S02 In my reviews here, I have many times pointed out the extraordinary number of fresh series that deliver the goods in S01 and then run dry by the end of S02. In other words, the producers welcomed the cash flow from the renewal, but were plain out of ideas. My guess is that over 70% of all streaming series suffer from this fate. The good news is that SLOW HORSES is not one of them. While the casting and production value of the series is great, the writing here is truly EXTRAORDINARY. Did the writing hold up for the second season? READ THE ROOM! -- to quote a killer line of dialog from S01 -- yes it did. Easily one of the best series in the history of streaming and I fully intend to put it on the appropriate IMDb list. ((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer."" Please check out my list ""167+ Nearly-Perfect Movies (with the occasional Anime or TV miniseries) you can/should see again and again (1932 to the present))",literal
"Had a good start, but bombed the second season The first season was charming and witty, and a great new reboot of a beloved classic. Jenna Ortega was fantastic, and many of the other characters added to the vibe of the season. I especially enjoyed cameos from so many of the actors who were in the 90s films. Season 1 was truly a bingeworthy show. Season two, on the other hand, could not be saved by Ortega. From the fashion losing its touch to the plot becoming convoluted and tweeny, I finished the last couple episodes to check a box rather than any feeling of entertainment. It is sad to see Netflix cancel promising shows in their pilot seasons when it is auto renewing the disappointment of Wednesday after this second season.",literal
"Season 1 - Very Good; Season 2 - Not So Good Dark Winds follows a savvy Navajo police lieutenant investigating various crimes on tribal lands while also navigating a complicated home life and the clash of cultures between residents of his reservation and wider society that variously denigrates, idealizes and ignores them.

Season 1 is very good, a gritty thriller that takes diversions to explore larger ideas without getting bogged down in them. Season 2 is a letdown in comparision; it mostly constitutes a bloated and repetitive chase for an Anton Chigurh-type killer with almost superhuman abilities (until the plot needs him to forget how to aim a rifle.) Plot threads are unresolved and the finale is plagarized straight from Wind River.

Also Season 1's presentation of the clash of cultures wasn't exactly subtle, but in Season 2 the writers went all in on sanctimonious pantomime.

Here's to hoping they can right the ship for Season 3.",literal
"Definitely my most favourite show of all time I really really love this show. I started watching it in Jan 2010 when my uncle gave me a DVD of it, and boy was I hooked! The humour just flows and there is not a dull moment in a single episode.

What I really like about TBBT is that it has quite a few golden scenes that you can watch over and over again. Case in point - Sheldon and Penny singing ""Soft Kitty"", Sheldon with a dreamy voice, while Penny is looking at him with gritted teeth. Or when Sheldon is overcome on receiving Leonard Nimoy's DNA. Or when Penny asks,""What do you guys do for fun?"", Sheldon says,""Well, some time back we tried masturbating for money"". Or Leonard's fruitless pursuit of Sheldon in the ball pit. Or...I can go on :)

Also, what really made me love this show is that I can totally relate to the geeky protagonists. I am a science nerd myself, and every time I see a joke or a gag, I find myself thinking,""That could have been me!""

Bottomline - This is a great, fresh show with boundless potential for more humour, and I really hope it is on air for a sizable amount of time to come.",literal
"Eerie and creepy Been awhile since I'd been to the movies and I had to see what all the hype was about?? I would say I definitely enjoyed the film. Loved how it was told in chapters. Just wished the whole ""thing"" was a bit more grounded in reality. I know, I know, I went to a genre piece but still.... the eeriness and creepiness always seems more real, when it is!",literal
"I witnessed Originality and Excellence Having just finished this amazing show I found myself thinking often how much I enjoyed it and wished there were more like it.

The writing was quirky and fun and made for well rounded characters who were played by some of my favorite actors as well as some I've not seen who performed their craft as admirably as their well known costars. One in particular that I hope to see more of is Ryan Kiera Armstrong who gave early Natalie Portman vibes and who I hope has many future opportunities.

If you're reading this to decide if you should watch this series then you have to ask yourself what kind of person you are.

I hope Ethan keeps making shows like this for a long time and thank him and everyone who made this happen.",literal
"Strangely compelling, but why? I am in only mid season 3 so far, but having seen this show thus far I felt it necessary to leave a review, especially after seeing the many inexplicable 10 ratings which mention Point Break and High Octane.

Animal Kingdom may be many things, but fast paces and high octane it is not. No, this is much more a rather slow burner of a drama with only tidbits of crime and action thrown in almost as if an afterthought. The show doesn't build around the crimes and jobs the Cody's commit and so far every single one of them has been pretty underwhelming. The viewer is show the highlights of the job, and there is very little victory or celebration to be felt even after the most successful heists because too much happens off screen. The action here is best filed under how to make robbery boring. The heists themselves are pretty ingenious, but the execution is just rather meh look we got more money. Give me the money. No we have to clean it first. Gets a little old.

Where Animal Kingdom gets it right, like other great crime-dramas of the past is that there are no heroes. Every character is shown, the good, bad, the ugly, warts and all. Character development and back story are pretty limited leaving the viewer at a loss most of the time. Even the family tree isn't fully painted to the point that there is no clear vision of who fits where or why. Even the relation between characters is not well defined. In a way, it adds more intrigue, but it can also make it hard to follow at first. The only real thing that can be said is that the Cody family are mostly made up of some pretty horrible people, all very deserving of whatever bad karma may be thrown at them next. It is difficult at times to find even a single person to root for here.

Still the show does have many positives. It is filmed in beautiful Oceanside, California and there are great scenes of the Strand, the Oceanside Pier and other locations throughout the city. As former resident, I loved how the characters talk about how real estate is ruining the beachfront because that is a war that has been raging since the mid 1980s. Some great surfing and other water sport scenes are peppered in as well, and the characters love traveling on a whim to Baja, either winding up in TJ or a bit further down south with mixed results.

At this point there have been some pretty good episodes, but also a lot of dull, slow episodes also. There is a hope that the show will reveal a little more each time, that I think is the main reason to keep watching here. Every time the Cody's do something dirty and you think you've seen their worst, you need to wait as they'll even do something more despicable later on. The reason to keep watching is the hope that this strange ride has a destination or a point somewhere.

As many times as I've been tempted to shut it off, I plan to soldier on through season 4 and hopefully 5 with the rest of you out there. Though often unlikable there is something about these Cody's that is down right addictive. If I had to compare this to anything it would not be anywhere close to Point Break. No, this has much more in common with Shameless.",literal
Great show The best show ever..I'm so addicted to it..great actors great character personalities..great plot too❤❤❤,literal
"Season 18, episode 8. The first day I LOVE this series...been watching sine it started and if I miss an episode, I can watch it on my on demand on my computer. I rarely cry watching NCIS, but last nights episode...I just couldn't help it. The title, The first day gets the NCIS team finally caught up to the pandemic. Everyone is wearing masks and are dealing with the struggle to get over this. Then I learned Jimmy's wife died because of the pandemic. It was heart breaking. Crying in Gibbs arms...he's really the only one who understands what he is going through...he told Gibbs that the hospital wouldn't let him see his wife after she died. I've heard of that happening, and let me tell you...they'd just have to arrest me. shoot me with animal tranquilizers, whatever. At the end he read a letter to his wife he'd written, all the things he loved about her. The whole squad gathered and Jimmy spoke to a picture of his wife and himself together on the view screen. I'm a 50 year old man and I couldn't help but cry. One of the most emotional episodes I'd ever seen. I'm not usually into spoilers, but as far as I'm concerned, that is for movies only....not TV shows. So there. Peace.",literal
"I didn't get Wicked Enough. For starters, I have seen the original Broadway Play of Wicked and I really like it. I love Wizard of Oz growing up and I thought it was a good interesting take of the world and setting.

As a film, I was always curious to see how it would be adapted. While I do appreciate it's faithfulness to the source, there are some good aspects but also not so good. Throughout, the costume designs, the production and the sound designs are amazing. It helps to build the world of Oz and create it's vibe. Including the musical score and singing that offers a vibrate, energized and colorful vibe.

However, as a whole, the dull presentation and it's stretched out narrative really seems to fail for me to fully engage with it's power. Writing wise, the narrative is interesting but being stretched out and added with unnecessary characters and moments makes it dried up. Causing some of the characters to be boring and not fully engaging.

The dialogue is pretty bad and there are some poor noticeable uses of CGI that kills away the magical vibe and feel of Oz. Most of the performances are just fine but they never really wowed me in anything particular. Because as a whole, I feel it's a bit overhyped.",literal
"No no no No not another Robin Hood. Do we not have any other periods in history writers can write about? There's always William Tell. Sorry Actors sorry Sean but enough is enough.

Refuse to watch. Sorry everyone.",literal
"Decent Premise, Slow Execution When Riley and her crew of Youtube paranormal investigators go missing, most of the world thinks its a hoax. Her sister Mia never gives up hope and becomes obsessed with finding her. Is the nightmare demon from their childhood real? Is it somehow involved?

This film starts off as a found footage film using internet clips and a documentary that MIa is filming. When something unexpected happens while filming it shifts its point of view to the typical narrative style. I have seen some complaints about this, I personally liked it. It's no different then using a montage of scenes to set up the main story. It stars Camille Sullivan as MIa. It took me a few minutes to figure out where i knew her from, the show Shoresy.

Unfortunately, that's about all I liked about this movie. It's the definition of meh. For first time director Chris Stuckmann, it's a good start, not a great one. It's a good enough story but pretty predictable. Biggest issue here is the pacing, it's painfully slow. There is a span of what felt like 15 minutes with MIa by herself looking for any info she can find, pretty much no words are spoken. That can be done if the actions on screen are interesting enough, but that just wasn't the case.

IMDb gives this one a 5.8/10 For me, it's a 5.0/10 Middle of the Morgue

Right or wrong, weak or strong...these are my opinions.",literal
"Another Mike Schur comedy with an emotional gut punch I am a huge fan of shows like The Good Place and Brooklyn 99, and this show delivered on my expectations. It wasn't as comedic as I thought it would be, but the emotional moments hit so hard. This show and it's themes will definitely resonate with older people, but even being new adult, it explores ideas I think about constantly. The character work was also great, all of the actors also giving it their all. Stephanie Beatriz was absolutely the highlight for me ad Didi, one of my favorite performances from her. This show would better be described as slice of life, rather then a comedy or spy mystery, but it's a great watch, I will absolutely be rewatching this when I'm having existential dread.",literal
"NO NOTES. PERFECTION In my 30 years in the medical field, I have never encountered a more accurate and emotionally resonant portrayal of life in the emergency room-or the healthcare profession as a whole-than what is depicted in this series. The raw intensity, the emotional weight, and the complexity of the doctor-patient dynamic are all portrayed with striking authenticity.

Noah Wyle delivers a career-defining performance as Dr. Robby, affectionately known by his team. He wears his heart on his sleeve, embodying the emotions every healthcare worker experiences day in and day out. From the housekeeping staff to the surgical team, every element is depicted with remarkable precision. This show surpasses any other medical drama currently on television, and the ensemble cast is, without question, the most impressive I have seen.

As someone who regularly watches medical dramas and has even served as a consultant for some, I can say without hesitation-this one needs no corrections. It is pitch-perfect.

A special mention must be made of Shawn Hatosy, affectionately known as ""Hats,"" whose portrayal of Dr. Abbott is equally powerful. The show's opening scene, with Dr. Robby talking Dr. Abbott down from the roof, mirrored by the closing scene where the roles are reversed, is a poignant reminder of the emotional toll one shift can take on a healthcare worker. One day. Fifteen hours. A million emotions.

Kudos to the cast and crew for their exceptional work. With the series now picked up indefinitely, promising one shift a year in The Pitt, I can say with deep appreciation-Noah Wyle, we're grateful you're here.",literal
"blah A movie can be overwrought and still have decent value. The ten commandments is a pretty good example.

A movie can be convoluted and also still be pretty good standing on it's own legs. Star wars and most light sci-fi since the genre was born.

But a movie that is both overwrought and convoluted, well there your operating in the Wiseau territory. Too much of 1950s era cinema finds itself in this mold and this two hour stomach churner is no different. A series of ridiculous coincidences lead to such self serious emotional hand wringing that the movie practically begs for the MST3K treatment. But this is light prestige, therefore humorous relief will not be forthcoming. A plot this bad should be justification for a prison sentence.",literal
"Great 1st & 2nd Seasons, doubting the 3rd I loved the first and second season of The white lotus. The pacing was nice, the mood was beautifully set with music and mythology. I loved the characters and their stories and there was stuff happening. The third season however has a pacing issue in my opinion. Right now I am on the second episode and both episodes were very, very boring. Most of the characters are really unlikable. The characters that were unlikable in the first two seasons were at least fun. The ones in the 3rd season are just unlikable and have no redeeming qualities. I hope something good happens in the third episode, because I am slowly loosing my patience. Also I have a complaint about the theme song. Loved the first two iterations in the previous seasons, but this one isn't as good at all. I would rate the first 2 seasons with an 8 and this season with a 5. If the season gets better I will come back and edit this review. If not-you will know;)",literal
"RUN, BEN, RUN The Running Man offers quite exciting action to follow. There are several themes that this film tries to explore, such as control, greed, resistance, and hope. This film offers an interesting and entertaining premise. Here we will see thunderous and thrilling action, with drama behind Ben Richards' character that actually feels a little bit lacking in emotion somehow. Then, this film also criticizes the entertainment media and corporations that control everything, we as viewers are successfully made to feel angry too. The characters are good but quite standard, the character development is enjoyable to watch. The pacing is almost perfect, there are a few parts that are just a bit slow. The cinematography is good and quite immersive. The editing is still Wright's signature use of fast-cuts and rhythm, but it feels like something is missing. The visual effects and CGI are very neat. The production design is extraordinary, making the dystopian atmosphere more pronounced. The sound design makes the action even more exciting, and sometimes made rhythmic with the catchy music too. The cast is very well performed, Glen Powell here is quite impressive. Overall, the film still has the feel of Edgar Wright, but not like his other films.

I give this 8.5/10.",literal
"A Heartfelt Mystery Full of Humor and Humanity Ted Danson's enduring charisma shines in A Man on the Inside, a heartwarming blend of comedy and mystery from The Good Place creator Michael Schur. The series introduces Charles (Danson), a lonely, retired widower who reinvigorates his monotonous life by taking on a private investigator role in a posh retirement community. Tasked with solving a jewelry theft, Charles finds himself fumbling through undercover work, ultimately discovering unexpected connections with the quirky residents around him. The show deftly balances humor and poignancy, using Danson's impeccable timing and an ensemble of veteran actors like Sally Struthers and Stephen McKinley Henderson to create a vibrant, multilayered narrative. It's a celebration of second chances and human connection, gently addressing themes like aging, grief, and reinvention without losing its comedic charm.

Based on the Oscar-nominated documentary The Mole Agent, Schur's latest venture mirrors the philosophical warmth of his previous works while carving its own identity. The series delights with its intricate whodunit, but its real treasure lies in the relationships that unfold. From Charles' evolving bond with his daughter Emily (Mary Elizabeth Ellis) to his reluctant friendships with fellow residents, the characters are endearing and nuanced. While it lacks the surreal humor of The Good Place, A Man on the Inside captivates with its sincerity, offering both laughter and heartfelt moments. Danson's effortless portrayal of Charles anchors the series, making it a must-watch for anyone seeking a comedic exploration of life's later stages.",figurative

"Awesome! Jeremy Renner absolutely kills it in this new series from Taylor Sheridan. I watched the entire season of Mayor of Kingstown from start to finish in one weekend and I'll probably watch it again sometime in the near future. It's every bit as good as I had for. Besides Renner it also stars Kyle Chandler, Aiden Gillen and Dianne Wiest. It's created by Taylor Sheridan (also creator of Yellowstone, 1883, Sicario, Hell or High Water, Wind River, etc). Sheridan has become one of the best writers in Hollywood and he hits another home run with this one. This While the acting is fantastic, the writing is just as good as the show will keep you entertained. It has everything you want in a great show...action, drama, suspense, twists, etc. It will keep you on the edge of your seat and wanting more. We need more shows like this!",figurative
"Very good mystery series They have some good, episodic cliffhangers, but for me, the charm of the show revolves around Steve Martin's and Martin Short's catalog of works - their expressions alone make me want to laugh. Selena Gomez is an excellent balance for the two comedians. The additions of Sting, Nathan Lane, Tina Fay and more, put it over-the-top for me.",literal
"Incredible Series! I highly recommend this series to anyone who loves drama, true crime, and corruption stories.

The story is true - I've followed it since 2021 and the amount of detail they included in the show is staggering! (Capri Sun anyone!?)

The timeline is compressed to tell this years-long story, but it stays true to the characters, the details and adds so much more than the headlines will ever do. You can feel Paul's inner struggle as a perpetrator and an ultimate victim, his desire to change, against his inability to change how he was raised.

This show deserves all of the awards. Very well done.",literal

"Terrifyingly brilliant. You'll float too. What persuaded me to watch this movie was the blessing bestowed upon it by the stories original creator, Stephen King, who claimed: ""I wasn't prepared for how good it really was"".

He's not wrong.

""IT"" is quite extraordinary. The attention to detail, the subtle but effective comedic undertone and the exquisite cinematography not only do the original title proud, they make this re-imagining of the original classic even better than its predecessor. 

It's a very scary film but what impressed me was how true the film sticks to the original's tricks; it isn't filled with loud in-your-face jump scares, in fact, a lot of what makes this film scary is the slick cinematography and intricate shadow play. The use of lighting and creation of atmosphere is what makes this film so tense, which is why it's perfectly suited for those who like Horror movies but without the obnoxious gore.

"I love this show! I want season 2 already! Tim Robinson's new HBO series The Chair Company is a masterclass in weaponizing awkwardness until it explodes into absurd, gut-busting hilarity, proving once again why this guy is the patron saint of cringe comedy. At its core, the show follows William Ronald Trosper (Robinson in peak everyman meltdown mode), a hapless office drone whose big promotion speech goes spectacularly sideways when his brand-new office chair buckles beneath him-leaving him sprawled in a puddle of professional humiliation. What could have been a forgettable blooper spirals into a full-blown conspiracy thriller as Ron fixates on the chair's manufacturer, convinced it's the tip of a corporate iceberg designed to undermine guys like him. Robinson's genius lies in how he turns this setup into a pressure cooker of escalating paranoia: his bug-eyed stares, those volcanic rants that start as whispers and erupt into full-throated tirades about swivel mechanisms and ergonomic sabotage, make every scene feel like a therapy session gone feral. It's like if I Think You Should Leave sketches stretched into a narrative fever dream, where the punchline isn't just the fall-it's Ron's unhinged quest to expose the ""chair cabal,"" complete with stakeouts in parking lots and interrogations that devolve into him yelling about lumbar support like it's the Watergate tapes.

The hilarity deepens with The Chair Company's surreal blend of mundane dread and escalating lunacy, courtesy of Robinson's airtight collaboration with co-creator Zach Kanin, who knows exactly how to mine the banality of office life for cosmic-level comedy. Guest stars like Lake Bell pop in as Ron's exasperated wife, delivering deadpan reactions that amplify the chaos, while the plot veers from HR nightmares to shadowy boardroom exposés that feel ripped from a QAnon fever dream-but funnier, because it's all filtered through Robinson's unflinching gaze on male fragility. One episode's highlight has Ron piecing together ""evidence"" from a single customer service hold tune, building to a confrontation that's equal parts The Office pettiness and Network rage, leaving you wheezing and wincing in equal measure. It's uncomfortable viewing at its finest, the kind that sticks with you like a bad office memo, reminding us that the real conspiracies aren't out there-they're in the petty injustices we all swallow daily. If you love comedy that leaves you questioning your own sanity, this is Robinson's magnum opus, a swivel into the void that's as brilliantly unhinged as it is relatable.",literal

"It's Pop-ular... This movie is LONG.... And it's mind-numbingly so if you do not like musical like myself.

With that in mind, this movie has broadway roots so ""over the top"" it definitely was in many ways, including in acting. . I know people say Cynthia did well , but her acting fell flat to me among all the other actors. The name of the movie is Wicked, but Grande definitely stole the show. I didn't care about the witches struggles and obstacles like I should have . I wasn't made to care about that character at all actually, which is strange to me. Usually I tend to root for the underdog characters but I didn't root for anyone really.

The CGI did its job, there were a few good songs. Overall, I was ready to leave at the two hour mark and had to sit there an extra 40 mins.. The silver-lining was that the movie did in fact end and my two eight year old girls did seem to like it even though they were starting to get pretty restless themselves. Again, it's a really long movie. They were excited to see there was a second Wicked coming out. I told them their dad can take them.",literal

But he's awesome as a leading man. Stewart is also amazing, of course. But I really feel like Adam Brody has been underrepresented for too long. Please make it right by making way more seasons of this. This show is funny, witty, quirky, romantic, sexy... all of it. I feel like Brody, as an artist is finally getting the recognition and applaud he has always deserved. To see him make such a great comeback just makes my heart happy!",literal
"I can't stand this show I tried to like ""The Big Bang Theory"". I really tried. However, after seeing a couple of episodes from this sitcom, I ended hating everything about it.

For me, the biggest problem from ""The Big Bang Theory"" (Besides of the unfunny jokes and the awful cultural references) were the characters. All of them were incredibly unlikeable and annoying (even those that the viewers are supposed to sympathize) unsurprisingly, those characters are also clichés, perpetuating the stereotypical characterization of the ""nerd"" archetype as seen in many, many other movies and television shows, since the film ""Revenge of the Nerds"".

All the references made in this show are not only bland, shallow and forced, but also painfully unfunny as well. To get things worse, that stupid laugh track made all those so-called jokes even more irritating, as it were constant reminders to the viewers of what they are supposed to be laughing at.

I consider ""The Big Bang Theory "" to be a strongly mediocre series with overused stereotypes and flat jokes. For me, this show was like the live-action equivalent of one those lame and unfunny gaming web comics which try to be ""cool"" and ""edgy"" by including misogyny and lots of random (and also utterly pointless) nerd references.

So, in other words, ""The Big Bang Theory"" is the (stereotypically) nerd version of ""Friends"".",literal
"OMG OMG OMG!! GIVE ME MORE PLEASE Thank you TV God's for bringing my all time #1 SHOW back to me and the rest of their deserving fan's. I'm so excited for this show to return, how I yelled the names of the cast members as I saw them and screamed when I noticed certain ones weren't there yet. The emotional ride of knowing these characters, how I feel like I've known them for twenty years plus. Their ups and downs, loosing Gideon Hotchner and Mr. Sexy himself Shemar Moore, watching the casting director weave in the new cast perfectly mixing them with the seasoned cast. This show delivers just like it did the first time! When something is done right it's just that RIGHT. Perfection is what you call this I'm counting the minutes till the next episode, it has me thinking is this even possible could it really be an UNsub like this out here. OMG OMG OMG!!",literal
"Went from hero to zero I can't remember the last time the beginning of a movie gripped me so strongly. After a few minutes, I put my phone away so I could give it 100% attention, I wanted to soak every detail up. This was going to be a landmark movie for me. Then the first perspective ends and they move on to covering the same events from different perspectives. Soooo badly done. The new perspectives don't add anything interesting to the story. Sure, there are subtle nuances, but they don't intrigue or impact the viewer and they might as well just have copied and pasted the first storyline several times. Then a complete cop-out ending destroys any last shred of interest. Moviemakers, there are more than 2 options for ending a movie. Put a tiny bit of effort into crafting an interesting ending, or employ someone who can. Should have been a 10/10 movie, instead it is a lazy movie and is an annoying chore to watch.",literal
Rubbish Bunch of characters that just don't fit. No chemistry and poor acting. Had more fun at the dentist. Long drawn out and boring. Script was as poor as anything I have watched in years. Just don't understand the good reviews at all. It's all predictable nonsense. I Really could slate the cast and acting further but to those who will still watch this can make up their own minds up.,literal
"Weapons Shooting Blanks NONSPOILER: Weapons is a movie with a lot of good ideas and interesting choices in execution of said ideas. What I like most about it is being bold and different in presentation and its overall vibe. Julia Garner and Josh Brolin lead an interesting cast, but the movie is far from perfect.

SPOILERS: I do not understand a few things. From the origin of the person causing the problem and why she is doing it, to why they reveal so much so early. #1 who is the narator because it is not Alex. #2 the movie establishes rules about the ritual sticks being used, then stops following them. Why isnt the final stick tossed in water to break the spell? And using this plot device also makes every death before the reveal pointless, because they were killed when all that had to be done was toss a stick in water. It's called deminishing your own plot. Also, the beginning naration is wrong, factually. ""None of them came home."" Uh. Pretty sure at the end the same narator says they all went home to their parents?? Frustrating. Weapons is really a movie with 0 back story that never explains anything. But it's fun.",literal
"3 hrs closer to death I actually created an account just so I could review this movie in the hopes of saving just one person from sitting through it and wasting three hours of their life. From the nonsensical timeframe to the ham, fisted political overtones to the extremely stupid ending. This went from being just a bad movie to perhaps the worst one I've ever seen. The only high point was a Steely Dan song in the soundtrack. Just listen to dirty work on Amazon music and save yourself the time, money and annoyance.",literal
Gibbs is weak No way a Marine gunny snT55iper would vomit at the crime scene. Gibbs is portrayed as a much weaker version of the one in NCiS. Too emotional and mentally fragile. He is whining through many episodes. Hard to gain any respect for him. The rest of the cast is ok. Mike should be calling him probie more. The episodes are not that great Gibbs does not seem to pick up on obvious clues. Maybe I am a little nostalgic for the old show and one of the things that made it watchable for me was the military bearing Gibbs showed when he entered a scene. The purple haired morgue worker doesn't fit the time period either.,literal
"Fortune Favors Balanced Comedy On Relevant Material O Aziz Ansari LIKES: Decent Pace Fun Acting Decent Material Keanu Reeves Is Well-Utilized Heart Fun Funny At A Lot Of Times A Novel Idea Summary: What can I say, this movie is led by some extreme comedy stars, and you expect a movie to be a very aggressive comedy; however, Good Fortune surprised me in terms of some surprising restraint. The film is a fun little spin on It's A Wonderful Life, a novel idea that seems blasphemous to mess with a classic, but, for me, it managed to do it in a surprisingly respectful way. The novel idea opens up a broad canvas to paint upon with jokes, as they try to address material that I find very relevant to the modern-day audience. Good Fortune is about looking at life in the glass-half-full case, but quickly shows that you can only hold that positivity for so long before reality catches up. Throughout the movie, the trio faces a lot of things that life can present with dialogue that is both entertaining and thoughtful, and it is filled with heart that feels much deeper than I anticipated in an Ansari comedy. Moral lessons are ever-present in this movie, but often not too in your face, preachy, or that cheese factor '90s sitcoms thrived in. No, there is authenticity, and the lessons are baked into the comedic moments, presented in a manner that feels natural, with the fun elements this movie promised being better than most award-winning speeches.

And that's the nature of this movie, it's really fun and funny. Good Fortune blesses us with a lot of silliness that is maximized by the comedic talents of the cast. The main trio work so well together, and have a chemistry that feels like an authentic friendship between these odd bedfellows. Rogen is back in his comedy elements, the loud, obnoxious rants that his gruff voice capitalizes on may seem excessive, but I felt there was a good balance that I enjoyed giggling at when he was faced with the harshness of real life. Ansari is fun, the whiny voice and hyperbolic shouting perfect for some of the writing, making me laugh when his small form is panicking, or having to realize what he has been dealt. But it's Keanu who accomplishes the most for me. He may not have the same range or energy as his counterparts, but I like that, as his monotone voice is a great reset that counters the manic elements of the others. They all present the material in fun ways, and I had a great time with their intermingling in this very odd, novel idea. It all runs at a decent, entertaining pace, delivering a heartfelt, simple plot in a relatively decent amount of time. Something I think will appeal to a lot of people out there.

DISLIKES: Not Fully Fleshed Out Character Utilization Is Meh Some Of the Subplots Are Spastic Some Course Language/Drug Comedy Is Not My Style The Finish Is Okay, But Not Awesome Could Have Been Funnier Summary All the fun aside, the movie does still have some limitations that I think may not be as impressive to the general audience. While it dutifully handles the material, the story feels lacking in details and not fully fleshed out in terms of the plot and delivery. I know comedy films aren't always meant to have the most elaborate stories, but something about Good Fortune feels discombobulated and not fully flowing as well as the lines are. One part is the character utilization. The primary trio of guys is decently done, but at times, there are gaps in their stories that feel displaced until they semi-naturally stitch themselves back into the story. Other characters played by the two girls on the poster are not the worst, having moments that steal the show for brief minutes before they sort of fall into the background. I felt there was more there, perhaps elements left on the cutting room floor or lost in a script rewrite. The subplots are relatively weak at times, and despite Ansari's talent with several factors, some of these stories felt weak, awkward, and oddly included. Such spastic writing can be annoying at times, but the fun the script instills works to distract and mitigate some of the shortcomings. As for the comedy elements, most work for me, but there are times when drugs and illicit language get excessive; sometimes, they are crudely introduced when not necessary. Most won't care for this limitation, but for those not impressed with such comedy, you have your warning. As for the finish, it's not bad, and actually kind of cute, heartwarming, and realistic, as it delivers a fitting finale. Was it the best? That's for the viewer to decide, but I think there was a little bit more they could have done to help bring just a little better closure. It's nitpicky, I know, but this sort of compounds to that there felt to be a missing element I would have liked to see more of. To answer the question of whether it could have been funnier, I believe the answer is yes. Again, I did enjoy the balanced humor, but with such material, there felt to be more unique directions with the humor that could have exploited these actors' talents just a bit more to feel unique.

The VERDICT: Good Fortune is indeed a movie that is surprisingly tasteful in its handling of such complex material, but still kept things fun, moving, and enjoyable. To have such a heart despite the crude outlook of life is not easy to achieve, and the strong cast took the lines and optimized their utilization to have me laughing a lot during the film. Alongside a good pace, entertaining concepts, and an enjoyable performance by Reeves, there is a lot of positive things to say about this movie. However, the movie's primary limitation is the sense of incomplete storytelling, primarily with the organization of the subplots and characters. As these elements stumbled about, I found that there was something off in terms of everything piecing together to fully capitalize on the laughs and material. A little better character use, some better focus on the twist to the story, and some more creative comedy could have further made this comedy stand out. Regardless, I think this film is going to be fun for a lot of people, especially in the balance of sincerity with stoner-comedy vibes. I think it's a fun one to hit the theater on, and would encourage you to go, so long as you avoid bringing little ears. My scores for Good Fortune are: Action/Comedy/Fantasy/Romance: 7.5 Movie Overall: 6.5-7.0.",figurative
A killer clown awakens from his twenty seven year sleep to terrorize the kid of Derry. The acting over all was really good but i wish they hadn't marketed it as so scary you wont sleep for months. When going into this i thought i was gonna get a really good scare but in all reality i found that it would work better as a dark comedy instead. However there was a few good jump scares but i found that sometimes the CGI looked weird. There was some hidden gestures to characters and scenes from the book but in all they left a lot of the book out. Im hoping for more of parts from the book in chapter two of the movie.,literal
"Festive brotherly fun A Very Jonas Christmas Movie is the kind of holiday chaos you didn't know you needed until the Jonas Brothers showed up with tinsel, inside jokes, and a Santa suit. It's hilarious and charming from start to finish, with the brothers bouncing off each other like they've been rehearsing Christmas banter since birth. The canal jump had me cackling-living in the Netherlands, I can confirm that's not exactly the kind of dip you take lightly in December. Jesse Tyler Ferguson as Santa was nothing short of iconic, like the North Pole suddenly got a Jonas upgrade. What makes it even better is the little peek into their private lives, which adds warmth to all the festive silliness. It's enjoyable, it's festive, and it's the kind of movie that makes you want to grab a hot chocolate, put on an ugly sweater, and pretend you're part of the Jonas family Christmas.",literal
Not well written The show has many holes in the story and scenes that make no sense and characters that must be able to walk through walls. You will see,literal
"Holidays are only complete with this movie My Christmas is filled with ritual, as I guess most people's are. Part of that ritual is National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, about which I have nothing but good things to say. This should be part of your Holiday season too, because despite it not seeming like it all the way through, the film as a whole is just so thoroughly festive, cheery and good-hearted.

 It opens with a great set-piece, Clark taking his family out in the ""front-wheel drive sleigh"" to dig their Christmas tree out of the snow-covered ground. He's a desperate loser, but you have to love the guy, working his butt off to give his extended family the perfect Christmas. (That's the difference in this Vacation movie, by the way - the Griswolds don't go anywhere, their folks come to them).

So the shenanigans finding a tree set the pattern for a season of chaos, fighting in-laws, squirrels, stupid relatives, huge dogs, snooty neighbours and collapsing turkeys. And as if that wasn't stress enough for poor Clark, he's waiting for his Christmas bonus to come through to cover a cheque he's already written.

The script brims with festive jollity, enthusing the audience with Clark's excitement for the holidays. Stand out moments include the welcome (and hilarious) return of Randy Quaid as Cousin Eddie, the uber-hick sponger with a trailer-full of weirdo kids and rubber sheets, and Mae Questel's appearance as Aunt Bethany. She used to voice Betty Boo, and plays the crazy old woman to perfection.

See this movie. Get it on video. I normally watch it the first time on a miserable October Sunday, when I start to think properly about Christmas. Nothing can replace this movie as the one thing guaranteed to get me looking forward to late December. Fabulous stuff, and as festive for me as tinsel and carols. Cuddle up with this one.",literal
"Quite enjoyable Have watched the first 3 episodes. Great scenery, cinematography, acting and costumes. I love the setting in late 1700s/early 1800s England. But the best part is that the central character is thoroughly likable, even if not thoroughly plausible. Oh....and yes, he is handsome and does have an awesome, cut torso, which is besides the point. What attracts me more and more to a series is whether or not there are likable characters portrayed by great actors conveying realistic dialogue. I much prefer to watch someone likable than to watch someone unlikeable. No...I do NOT love to hate a villainous character. I would love to love a virtuous character. I am at an age, 55, where focusing on the positive in life is so much more important than focusing on the negative. I just wish Hollywood and the movie industry would catch up with me.",literal
"Awful Love Morena Baccarin, which is why I gave this show a chance. Couldn't get past the first 10 minutes. Baccarin's acting was stiff and feels manufactured, like she is reading off a script. Not the actress I recall from her Firefly/Serenity days. In addition, a sheriff wearing big earrings is a minor bloop that speaks volumes to the attention to detail, or lack thereof, in this show. No front-line worker would wear jewellery like that; it is a safety risk. The earrings were just so distracting. Lastly, as is the fault for many procedurals, the show felt weighed down by the melodrama. Not a good show at all.",literal
"Great Animation Movie Maui, a demigod, steals the cornerstone of all creation: the heart of Te Fiti, resulting in the slow destruction of the ancient Polynesian islands. Moana, an island chieftain's daughter, must find Maui and set things right.

""When you write using a bird's beak, it's called tweeting,"" declares Maui - an ancient demigod who has no business referencing Twitter. His charm is lost on Moana, but in this moment, you realize the kind of goofiness you're in for.

The story comes from a Polynesian myth. Goddess Te Fiti creates all life and takes the form of an island. Maui (Dwayne Johnson), a shapeshifting hero, then steals her heart (a piece of glowing rock), bringing a curse upon all the surrounding islands. In the process, he also loses his magical fish hook and is rendered superpower-less. Moana (Auli'i Cravalho), the princess of one such affected island, is chosen by the ocean to find Maui and restore the heart of Te Fiti.

On paper, Moana is a quintessential Disney story: there's an aspirational princess; a flawed hero, quirky comic reliefs (a senile grandma, a brainless chicken); the promise of a happy ending and most importantly, the golden message of chasing what your heart desires.

It's a narrative triumph, which is ironic, because the central idea itself is unoriginal to the core. One can't help but wonder: will we ever experience journey-away-from-home-to-find-metaphorical-treasures fatigue in animated films? You find big spoonfuls or tiny traces of it in almost all modern animation classics from Finding Nemo to Up to Inside Out, and Moana makes no efforts to take any detours.

However, the movie chugs along with breathtaking animation, adorable interactions between the strong-willed girl and the hilariously self-obsessed demigod, and songs that make you shimmy involuntarily. There's even a Mad Max: Fury Road-inspired battle scene.

Moana literally means 'the ocean' and as the heroine conquers her namesake, she also conquers your heart. You won't regret setting sail and voyaging with her.",figurative
"Kevin Costner Does It Again I don't believe anyone does western films better than Kevin Costner and with Taylor Sheridan writing it is a win win for viewers. Take a look at ""Wind River"" for an example of what Taylor Sheridan can do. Where has Cole Hauser been hiding? He is amazing. I guess the daughter is a necessary part, but she is over the top at being a bitch. The scenery is fantastic and being from Colorado I can really appreciate the vast beautiful land. Do yourself a favor and get hooked on this series as it is going to be a winner.",literal
"All sorts of EMotion This was an awesome movie. It made me laugh, it scared me, made me jump, had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. I honestly do not recommend bringing your young children. It does involve cussing and sexual language. But if old enough, I highly recommend. Pennywise is well done, the plot of the story sets up a great sequel and I am very excited for the next one.",literal
"The best show on television It is staggering how few people have watched this series. Everyone I know who has devoured it (because binge on this you will) universally agrees it's the best TV series they've seen. Arguably ever.

What is unarguable for me is how Gary Oldman is the finest actor of his generation. He is an incredibly versatile character actor, a walking tour de force who brings every ounce of his immense yet understated genius to his portrayal of Jackson Lamb.

And, though he is undoubtedly the jewel in the crown, he is not out of place here. The scripts are sensational. The characters well drawn and entirely plausible. The plots are at once exciting and slow-burning, with a healthy admixture of action scenes. The dysfunction it places at the heart of MI5, Britain's domestic intelligence service, is the consummate contraposition of James Bond's slick MI6.

Where Bond is bravado and machismo, Lamb is lumbago and impetigo. He is a bully and a misery but a hugely likeable character nonetheless, thanks to his ready, acerbic wit. His devil-may-care approach to his art lends him familiar commonalities with Bond. This is as if Connery's Bond went on too long and grew to hate his work and the world.

The narcissism of the careerist higher-ups feels apt, and nicely portrayed by Krisitin Scott Thomas and Sophie Okonedo, who give us more rounded, better developed figures than Dame Judi Dench's task-focused M.

Then there are the Slow Horses themselves. All immensely flawed, by turns hapless and yet heroic. In them we see the secret agents we mere mortals might perhaps have been. This is the most wonderful television. Treat yourselves, you will not regret it.",figurative
"A Frustrating Portrait of Madness, Strong in Craft but Weak in Connection Die My Love is a film that excels on a technical level but fails to create a compelling or coherent narrative. The cinematography is impressive, with masterful long takes and thoughtful framing, and the production design effectively establishes a cold, unsettling atmosphere. However, these strengths are undermined by a frustrating central story.

The film's biggest issue is its protagonist, Grace. We are given almost no time to understand or connect with her before her rapid descent into violence and instability. This makes her actions-from a bizarre affair to shocking acts of self-harm-feel alienating rather than tragic. The plot often blurs the line between reality and delusion to a confusing degree, leaving the audience unsure of what is actually happening and ultimately uninterested in the outcome.

While Jennifer Lawrence delivers a committed performance, it lacks the transformative quality needed to ground the abstract and often pretentious script. The film is not boring, but it is a tedious and emotionally distant exercise that left me more frustrated than moved.",literal
"Compliment I liked it. I really did like it a Lot!

After just watching Murder in a Small Town, I was quite impressed with the simple plot of a murder that the small towns' new Police Chief was thrust into solving having recently joined the Gibsons Police force.

The new police chief. Karl Alberg (Rossif Sutherland) is an impressive murder investigator bringing his vast knowledge from a major city police force to the small quaint town of Gibsons.

I also loved the character in this new TV series is the town's librarian, Cassandra Lee who meets Police Chief Karl Alberg through a dating web site service they both decided to subscribe to.

I enjoyed this pilot episode and I am looking forward to the new story lines and the characters in the town of Gibsons.",literal
"Bravo to the show and its creators. Wow...I know I am probably quite late to this show..but really WOW...

First of all bravo to this wonderfully written and amazingly talented cast. I just finished watching the last season and and I am longing for more. Initially I kept away from this series watching the first season, somehow was not in favor for its recording style, what they call it as the mockumentary. But few weeks back running out of good shows to watch, I thought may be I should give it an another chance. And so GLAD I DID.. Am absolutely in love with this series, the characters, the writing, its a wholesome pack, especially the character played by Steve Carell - Michael Scott, man he is a pure genius. Steve Carell can take the scene from funny to palm face to pity in matter of seconds, he was like an emotional wheel.

Also the characters PAM, Jim, Dwight and Andy played respectively by Jenna Fischer,John Krasinski, Rainn Wilson and Ed Helms were the life of the show, even after Steve Carell left they managed to keep the show lifted and to its standard.

I am so glad I never saw the original UK series and now probably I would never end up watching it, for the pure reason of not to end judging either of the shows.

I think the two most emotional and heart touching moments were the one where Michael says goodbye and the second being the finale.

If I had to rate the top three episodes they would be:

1) Good bye Michael. Well this episode will make u leave a river of tears. What a well written episode,and a perfect way to say good bye to Steve Carell and his character Michael Scott.

2)Finale: Again wonderfully written, played with our emotions and brought all the memories of the shoe back.

3)Business school: I rate this episode merely for the scene at the art gallery where PAM was about to leave with her paintings and Micheal comes and appreciates her and her paintings for how good they were. I think that was an amazing Scene.",literal

No wonder this show is a success. Thumbs Up!",literal
"too tedious This show has a lot of potential for a well known story to build the backstory and characters into a lively adventure.

"End of Beginning I started this masterpiece at 5/23/2024 Better Call Saul, a prequel to the critically acclaimed Breaking Bad, has firmly established itself as one of the best TV series of all time. From the moment the first episode started, I was hooked and unable to tear my eyes away from the screen. Just like its predecessor, Better Call Saul delivers a brilliant blend of compelling storytelling, complex characters, and stunning performances that keep viewers on the edge of their seats.

Set in the legal world of Albuquerque, the show follows James McGill, a small-time lawyer struggling to make a name for himself. Portrayed by the phenomenal Bob Odenkirk, McGill's transformation into the morally ambiguous Saul Goodman is a sight to behold. Odenkirk's acting prowess shines through as he effortlessly navigates the intricate layers of McGill's character, providing viewers with a masterclass in performance.

One of the greatest strengths of Better Call Saul lies in its writing. The series expertly balances intense legal drama with moments of dark humor, creating a unique atmosphere that is simultaneously engaging and entertaining. The complexities and intricacies of the legal profession are portrayed with remarkable realism, weaving captivating courtroom scenes into the wider narrative seamlessly.

In true Breaking Bad fashion, Better Call Saul also excels at developing multifaceted characters that leave a lasting impression. From the morally conflicted Kim Wexler (Rhea Seehorn) to the lovable yet enigmatic Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks), the supporting cast delivers stellar performances that add depth and richness to the story. Each character feels fully fleshed out, with their own motivations and flaws that make them relatable and compelling.

Visually, Better Call Saul is a treat for the eyes. The cinematography captures the essence of Albuquerque, with its wide desert landscapes and gritty urban settings. The attention to detail helps create an immersive viewing experience, enhancing the overall storytelling.

Furthermore, the series masters the art of suspense, leaving viewers craving more with every episode. The carefully crafted plotlines and seamless pacing keep the narrative tight, ensuring that there is never a dull moment. As the story unfolds, fans of Breaking Bad will appreciate the subtle references and connections that ultimately tie the two shows together.

"My first review of this new chapter in Criminal Minds and the show as a whole Amazing start to a new chapter of Criminal Minds! I am so far no doubt satisfied with the new episodes and I hope this stays like this throughout this season. I have loved the OG Criminal Minds however I hope under this new management the series can have it glory back. I've been rating TV shows and movies between 6-10 and I hope to rate every episode 8-9 this season too. I do see potential in this change of management and hope that more series will be made after this one ends. Penolopi is back! Let the magic commence.. You will not leave this show when we all love you! And the other characters of course except for the killers.. We don't like you at all.

I will see if my rating will change as the series progresses however I am just a normal person who likes these kinds of shows; so I enjoy every episode old or new unless... Unless I find mistakes, boredom, fakeness, or something.. Don't see why I should look out for these because I am pleased with everthing that was made. I am a viewer from 2020 (watch every season) and a huge fan of this show! Can't wait for more.",literal
"How i felt about this movie From the opening scene, Eternity captured me completely - not just as a rom-com or fantasy, but as a heartfelt meditation on love, loss, memory, and what truly defines ""forever."" Director David Freyne has crafted something rare: a film that feels both grand in its premise and deeply intimate in its emotional beats.

The setup is beautiful: after death, everyone has a week in a mesmerizing ""Junction"" to decide where they'll spend eternity. Joan (Elizabeth Olsen) finds herself between two loves - her first husband Luke (Callum Turner), who she barely lived a life with because of war, and Larry (Miles Teller), the man she grew old with and built her life around.

What makes this movie exceptional are its performances. Olsen is luminous, conveying regret, affection, longing and the weight of a life well-lived yet full of unspoken ""what ifs."" Teller's Larry is warm, grounded, vulnerable; Turner's Luke is wistful, idealized, yet heartbreakingly real. The supporting cast - especially Da'Vine Joy Randolph and John Early as the afterlife coordinators - provide levity without undercutting the emotional stakes.

Visually and tonally, Eternity strikes a sublime balance. The afterlife is painted with whimsical, imaginative touches - it's not bleak, not pretentious, but magical and precise. The production design, the pacing, the color palettes - all serve the story, mirroring the moods of nostalgia, hope, and sorrow. The soundtrack underscores emotion without becoming manipulative.

If there is anything minor to quibble with, it's that in parts the film leans heavily into its joke-beats, which slightly undercuts what could be even more poignant, especially in its final act. But honestly, those moments are few, and they never diminish the movie's overall resonance.

What makes Eternity soar to a 10/10 for me is that it asks a question we all think about: what would you choose, between what was, and what might have been? It doesn't answer it easily. It doesn't try to trick you. It trusts its characters - and its audience - to feel.

If you love stories that linger in your heart, that make you both laugh and cry, that explore love in all its complicated beauty - Eternity is not just worth your time, it's essential.",figurative
"The phone's ringing again and horror fans should definitely answer. Four years after the nightmare that shook audiences in 2021, The Black Phone 2 rings again and this time, the call comes from the other side. Director Scott Derrickson returns to the world of his breakout hit with a bolder, darker, and more ambitious sequel that dares to go full supernatural without losing the emotional pulse that made the first film so haunting.

Set in 1982, The Black Phone 2 picks up with Finney Blake (Mason Thames) still trying to cope with the trauma of being kidnapped by and ultimately killing The Grabber (Ethan Hawke). Life has moved on, but the scars remain. Meanwhile, his sister Gwen (Madeleine McGraw), whose psychic gifts once saved him, begins to experience a new wave of terrifying visions: mutilated children, shadowed corridors, and a ringing phone that won't stop echoing in her dreams.

Blumhouse has had a rough streak lately, cranking out more misfires than hits, and many horror fans (myself included) began to doubt the studio's edge. But The Black Phone 2 is the sharp turn the studio desperately needed. It's not just a sequel it's a creative evolution. Derrickson and Cargill take a massive swing by transforming The Grabber from a grounded human monster into something far more sinister: a supernatural entity feeding off fear, haunting the minds of children like a modern-day Freddy Krueger.

It's a bold move and it works.

Jason Blum has long been vocal about wanting to tackle A Nightmare on Elm Street, and since those rights remain out of reach, he's seemingly built his own nightmare realm here. The dream sequences in The Black Phone 2 are pure horror artistry... eerie, surreal, and unsettlingly beautiful. When Gwen slips into her visions, the film's tone and texture morph into an 8mm, home-video aesthetic that feels both nostalgic and nightmarish. It's immersive, like Terrifier 2 meets The Ring, with the intimacy of a child's worst fear come to life.

What really elevates this sequel is its shift in focus. While the first film centered on Finney's survival, The Black Phone 2 follows Gwen's journey, exploring her psychic abilities, her trauma, and her spiritual connection to the afterlife. Madeleine McGraw carries the film with confidence and empathy, balancing strength and vulnerability in a performance that feels both tragic and triumphant.

Finney's trauma is also explored with care, we see how the events of the first film continue to haunt him. The siblings' bond remains the emotional anchor, grounding the supernatural chaos in something real and deeply human.

Ethan Hawke's return as The Grabber is still chilling, though slightly less terrifying this time around. Now more spectral than physical, his menace has evolved, less about brute force, more about psychological terror.

What The Black Phone 2 nails is its ability to make you feel like you're watching an '80s horror classic for the first time not as an adult analyzing tropes, but as a kid peeking through your fingers, terrified and fascinated all at once. The film's tone, texture, and pacing capture that magic perfectly. It's got grit, heart, and just enough absurdity to feel alive.

This film pulled me in and made me feel something I haven't felt since Terrifier 2, that rush of pure, nostalgic horror that reminds me why I fell in love with the genre in the first place. It's creepy, cathartic, and beautifully haunting that I can't wait to see in theaters again.",figurative
"Not great, not terrible... The acting is average, besides a few actors that do a great work, but for the story, I might say that they have stolen a lot from stranger things... it's almost annoying, you can see the group of children riding bikes, you can see Haloran going ""to the upside down"" (pitch black) using his psychic abilities, also the effects used are not so good, they might scare a 10 year old, but that's pretty much it.. I expected way more, given the movies before that.",figurative
"Pointless. Boring. Uneventful. Completely forgettable. There is something off about this from the start. There are too many characters and plot lines that go nowhere. For a while it feels like this is heading towards some sort of conclusion, but it never arrives. There's no payoff. I think it's poorly directed. The script is a mess. It tries to be too many things at once and ends up being about nothing.",literal
"One of the best series I have seen in a long time. Action/crime/drama - it has all of it! Jeremy Renner portrays the part amazingly well. I only hope ""Iris"" comes back for season II. I have all my friends and family watching now.",literal
"Overrated? Too hyped? Indeed! Honestly, I think this movie is pretty overrated. It tries to bring a fresh perspective to the horror genre, and I'll give it some credit for attempting something different. But beyond that, it doesn't really deliver anything groundbreaking.

What really bugs me is how much praise it's getting-mostly, I think, because of the name behind it. If this exact film had been made by a lesser-known or indie director, I highly doubt it would be getting this level of attention or acclaim. It's almost like the reputation of the filmmaker is carrying the movie more than the actual quality of the work itself.

In the end, it's not the worst movie out there, but it's definitely not deserving of all the hype.",literal
