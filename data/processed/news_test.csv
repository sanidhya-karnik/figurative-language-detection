"Driven out of their homes

Belief in witchcraft is deeply entrenched across Ghana, cutting through both rural and urban life, explains John Azumah, the director of the Sanneh Institute in Accra, a research centre, which has long supported survivors of witchcraft accusations and is part of a coalition pressing for legal and social reform.

“It’s not just a Ghanaian thing,” Azumah says. “Belief in the supernatural is so powerful in Africa. It’s very strong in Nigeria, in East Africa ... What is unique about Ghana is the camps in the north.”

Although accusations occur in other parts of Ghana, women in those areas are more likely to be ostracised than banished. Meanwhile, in the north, the accused are often sent to the “witch camps” that usually serve as their last refuge.

The camps are often located near or within villages and are overseen by traditional priests or camp chiefs, typically appointed by village leaders. The camp in Gambaga is the oldest and most well-known, but others exist in Kukuo, Gnani, and Kpatinga.

Women, often elderly, widowed, or without strong family protection, are most frequently targeted, Azumah says. Many, too, are “the poorest of the poor”, he added. Once accused, they are vulnerable to mob violence, abandonment, or lifelong banishment.

Sometimes, the accusations have deadly consequences. In July 2020, 90-year-old Akua Denteh was lynched in a public market after being accused. Her brutal killing shocked the nation, and sparked calls for reform.

“It is violence against women - a demonisation of women,” Azumah says, explaining how witchcraft is not always viewed as inherently evil. Women accused of witchcraft are feared and condemned, while men who are accused of it are thought to use it for protection or good, he explains.

Almost any misfortune can be interpreted as evidence of witchcraft, says Azumah. “Sometimes people are just accusing others maliciously, or to get them out of the way for some reason. It could be fights over property or farmland, or it could just be pure jealousy, like somebody's child is doing well in school.”

Once a woman is accused and sent to a camp, she may undergo a traditional ""trial"", involving the slaughter of a chicken or guinea fowl. ""When the guinea fowl or chicken is dying, the position of the body determines the outcome [of the trial],"" explains Alasan Shei, the traditional spiritual leader who oversees the Gnani camp. ""If it falls on its back with the head facing up, it means the woman has some witchcraft. But if it lies face down, then she is innocent.""

Yet even when this ritual “proves” innocence, returning home is rare. For most women, the accusation alone is enough to drive them from their communities.

“Most often, the communities where the women are accused will not be ready to accept them back,” says Shei.",literal
"Government spokesman says the attack in Khost destroyed a civilian home, killing five boys, four girls and a woman.

At least nine children and a woman have been killed after Pakistani forces bombed a house in the country’s southeastern Khost province, according to Afghan authorities.

Zabihullah Mujahid, the spokesman for the Taliban administration, said on Tuesday that the attack took place at midnight (19:30 GMT) in the Gurbuz district of Khost province.

The latest attack risks triggering renewed hostilities and comes as a fragile ceasefire between the two nations hangs by a thread, with each side blaming the other for the impasse in the negotiations.

“The Pakistani invading forces bombed the house of a local civilian resident, Waliat Khan, son of Qazi Mir,” Mujahid wrote in a post on X.

“As a result, nine children [five boys and four girls] and one woman were martyred, and his house was destroyed,” he added.

Other air strikes took place in northeastern Kunar and eastern Paktika provinces, Mujahid said, wounding at least four civilians.

There was no immediate comment from Pakistan.

The bombardment in Afghanistan comes a day after a suicide attack that targeted the headquarters of Pakistan’s paramilitary Federal Constabulary force in Peshawar.

The Jamaat-ul-Ahrar – which is a splinter group of the Pakistan Taliban, known by the acronym TTP – claimed responsibility for that attack.

State broadcaster PTV reported the attackers were Afghan nationals, and President Asif Zardari blamed the “foreign-backed Fitna al-Khawarij” – Islamabad’s term for the TTP fighters it accuses of operating from Afghan soil.

Another suicide attack in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad, earlier this month killed at least 12 people and was also claimed by a faction of the Pakistan Taliban. Pakistan blamed a cell that was “guided at every step by the … high command based in Afghanistan” for the attack on the capital.

Relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan have been fraught since the Taliban swept back to power in 2021, and worsened after deadly border clashes in October that killed about 70 people on both sides.

The fighting ended with a ceasefire brokered by Qatar and Turkiye, but talks in Istanbul failed to produce a lasting deal, with security issues, especially Pakistan’s demand that Kabul curb TTP fighters proving a sticking point.

Pakistan accuses the Taliban of sheltering fighters behind a surge in attacks, including the TTP, which has waged a bloody campaign against the country for years.

Afghanistan denies the charge and counters that Pakistan harbours groups hostile to the country and does not respect its sovereignty.",literal
"With the United States retreating under President Trump, Southeast Asia and the Global South must show what real climate leadership looks like.

America’s renewed scepticism, and even hostility under Donald Trump’s second administration, does not for one moment alter the fact that climate change is real.

Neither does it negate the reality that the Global South — including the almost 700 million-strong Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), virtually all of which are tropical countries — is on the front line of the climate crisis.

Typhoons Tino and Uwan, which recently struck our region, especially the Philippines, are the latest proof of this and a reminder of the urgent need for climate justice.

What the Global South needs from summits like COP30 has been stated time and time again. It really boils down to four things.

The developed world needs to listen

On the one hand, developed countries need to listen to developing and less developed countries on how climate change should be addressed.

A rigid approach to the various facets of climate action, including technology, energy transition and biodiversity conservation, will ultimately frustrate the sincere, proactive measures that many Global South countries, including Malaysia and several of its ASEAN partners, are taking towards these goals.

More flexibility on the part of the Global North would go a long way towards ensuring that the war against climate change is won.

This is not an attempt to water down or deflect anything. The right to live in a sustainable environment is arguably a fundamental human right.

Israel’s devastating war in Gaza has also resulted in widespread ecocide that Western nations have remained strangely silent on, but whose ramifications — not only for the Middle East but for the wider world — will last for decades.

There should therefore be no doubt that sustainability and human rights go together. Supporting the former, especially in ASEAN and the Global South, is a means of upholding the latter.

Developed countries should bring their chequebooks

At the risk of putting things crudely, money talks. The various climate finance commitments — especially those for vulnerable nations — must not only be fulfilled, but also increased.

Projections from the United Nations Global Policy Model estimate that developing countries will need around $1.1 trillion in climate finance by 2025 and some $1.8 trillion by 2030.

The chair of the COP30 UN Climate Change Conference, Brazil, has rightly said that it hopes the meeting in Belem will be remembered as “the COP of Adaptation Implementation”. This is astute because, while I do not share the view that it is too late to act, it should be painfully clear that climate action can no longer be about setting lofty goals. Rather, the time has come to deliver.

The Global South can lead on climate change

Admittedly, the absence of the United States — as the world’s superpower and largest economy — looms over the COP and any international efforts to protect the environment. But the absence of the US is not a reason to retreat from climate action, or any other international cause; rather, it is an opportunity to reaffirm and strengthen multilateral cooperation.

Although it would be nice to have the US involved, the world can act without America. As has been widely reported, China’s carbon dioxide emissions have either flatlined or fallen over the past 18 months.

Moreover, the Tropical Forest Forever Facility (TFFF), proposed by Brazil’s President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, is an important part of the solution.

With the World Bank as its trustee and interim host, the TFFF seeks to support lasting conservation strategies and protect crucial tropical ecosystems through global, public and private partnerships.

With a medium-term goal of achieving a $125bn fund, the TFFF Launch Declaration has been endorsed by 53 countries and 19 sovereign wealth funds. Among them are 34 tropical forest countries, covering 90 percent of the tropical forests in developing nations.

It has been reported that Norway, Brazil, Indonesia, Portugal, France and the Netherlands have already made financial commitments. So far, $5.5bn has been announced — an encouraging, albeit modest, start to what will be a long journey.

Nevertheless, the TFFF shows that the Global South has the potential to build initiatives of its own, including on existential global challenges such as climate change.

Again, this is something the Global North must support. It arguably owes a “debt” to tropical countries for the huge carbon sinks they provide.

This must be achieved not through prescriptive policies, but through equitable, transparent climate reparations to ensure that the burden of conserving irreplaceable biodiversity does not come at the cost of education, jobs or dignity for the people of these countries.

ASEAN must do its part

The tropical countries — including those in ASEAN — cannot shirk their responsibilities, either.

It was disappointing that climate change did not feature more prominently during the recent 47th ASEAN Summit in Kuala Lumpur, which was chaired by Malaysia’s Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, despite the 2025 chairmanship’s theme of “Inclusivity and Sustainability.”

To be fair, the Chair’s Statement commendably noted that the regional bloc had “adopted the ASEAN Joint Statement on Climate Change” at COP30 and “welcomed the ASEAN Pavilion”, as well as “looked forward to the development of the ASEAN Climate Change Strategic Action Plan (ACCSAP) to further advance climate action in the region”.

The ASEAN Declaration on the Right to a Safe, Clean, Healthy and Sustainable Environment was also adopted during the summit in Kuala Lumpur, following several years of diplomacy among member states.

We must also not forget that the ASEAN Summit saw the historic accession of Timor-Leste to our ranks and progress on the ASEAN Power Grid.

These are all commendable achievements, but they still fall short of the proactive posture the developing world often urges the developed world to take. We must do as much — if not more — than we expect of others.

Some may argue that ASEAN lacks the financial capacity to act alone. But 2025 summits have shown that it has the credibility and influence to connect disparate blocs — including China, the BRICS coalition of economies, the Gulf Cooperation Council, the European Union, Africa and Latin America.

How far does the ASEAN Joint Statement on Climate Change go in recognising that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) lists Southeast Asian countries among those that will be hardest hit by climate change?

Without action, words remain just words. This leaves ASEAN — which has a proud record of neutrality — vulnerable to accusations of pandering to Trump (who, as we know, was briefly present at the summit) even in the face of climate-related disasters affecting our people.

What ASEAN — and indeed the rest of the Global South — needs is bold, decisive multilateral action in partnership with like-minded regions.

The urgency that ASEAN demonstrates in defending its geopolitical agency and advancing economic integration must now manifest in stronger, more vocal climate leadership.

More can and should be done. It is still not too late for both the developed and developing worlds to win the fight against climate change.

"Ukraine and its allies welcomed progress Monday after high-stakes talks with the United States over the plan to end Russia’s war, which Washington has pressured Kyiv to endorse by Thanksgiving.

Meetings in Geneva produced an “updated and refined peace framework,” Ukraine and the U.S. said in a joint statement that described ""meaningful progress"" from the ""highly productive"" talks.

No specific details were released. European leaders expressed optimism but cautioned that ""major issues"" remained as Kyiv and its allies sought to navigate the U.S. ultimatum to accept the 28-point proposal they view as handing the Kremlin its key demands.

Moscow continued to suggest it had been shut out of the discussions, and it was unclear whether any counterproposals from Ukraine would be acceptable to Russia.

President Donald Trump also weighed in. ""Is it really possible that big progress is being made in Peace Talks between Russia and Ukraine??? Don’t believe it until you see it, but something good just may be happening,"" he said in a post on Truth Social early Monday.

The Ukrainian delegation was on its way home to report back on the progress made, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. “Based on these reports, we will determine the next steps and the timing,” he added.

Speaking earlier by video link at a summit in Sweden, Zelenskyy said that Kyiv was working with partners ""to look for compromises that strengthen but not weaken us.""

He had warned Friday that his country faced perhaps its most difficult week yet, confronting the choice between its “dignity” and a “key partner.”

Trump injected greater tension as talks took place in Switzerland, accusing Kyiv of expressing “zero gratitude” to the U.S. for its support throughout the conflict.

Yet, Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters that “a tremendous amount of progress” had been made after the talks with Ukraine.

Zelenskyy, attempting the balancing act of appeasing Trump and ensuring his nation's sovereignty while under fire at home for a corruption scandal, said that “Ukraine was grateful to the United States, to every American heart, and to President Trump personally.”

In a separate statement, Zelenskyy said there were “signals President Trump’s team is hearing us.”

Asked about the pressure on Ukraine to at least agree to a framework by Thanksgiving, Rubio said the U.S. wants to “get this done” as soon as possible. “Obviously, we’d love it to be Thursday,” he added.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday that there are no plans for Zelenskyy to come to the White House “at this moment in time” but advised things can change quickly. She added that Rubio, special envoy Steve Witkoff and the team in Geneva worked through the 28-point peace plan with input from both the Russians and the Ukrainians over the weekend.

“The vast majority of these points have been agreed upon. The Ukrainians have worked on language with us together, and you heard that from their delegation directly yesterday. So we feel as though we’re in a very good place,” Leavitt said. “Of course, we have to make sure that all of these points are agreed to. And then, of course, we’re going to have to make sure the other party in this war, the Russians, agree to them, as well.”

But, while there were signs of progress, Europe remained wary as America's traditional allies scrambled to respond to the sudden emergence of a deal that could define the continent's security.

“The negotiations were a step forward, but there are still major issues which remain to be resolved,” Finnish President Alexander Stubb said on X.

European Union leaders met to discuss the issue at a summit already taking place in Angola on Monday, as a counterproposal from major European powers circulated in the media.

“While work remains to be done, there is now a solid basis for moving forward,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement following the meeting.

A German government spokesperson said Berlin saw the progress made in Geneva “very positively,” according to Reuters.

The plan backed by Trump amounts to Ukraine's effective capitulation, ceding key territories to Russia while reducing its military in return for no major concessions from Moscow.

Russian President Vladimir Putin wants legal recognition for what he has “stolen,” Zelenskyy said Monday in reference to the plan’s provision for the entire eastern Donbas region, as well as Crimea, annexed in 2014, to be de facto recognized as Russian. “To break the principle of territorial integrity and sovereignty, and that’s the main problem,” he added.

U.S. allies and lawmakers have raised questions over who may have been behind the plan and how much Ukraine was consulted.

Rubio insisted Sunday that the plan was authored by the U.S. after a bipartisan group of senators said he had told them that the text being discussed was a Russian initiative given to special envoy Witkoff.

Moscow has maintained it has not officially been looped in to talks.

During a call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on Monday, Putin said the plan, ""in the version we have reviewed,"" is consistent with discussions at his summer summit with Trump in Alaska, ""and, in principle, could form the basis for a final peace settlement,"" according to a Kremlin readout.

Still, it’s unclear if the Kremlin would agree to any modifications that would be necessary to get Ukraine and Europe to sign on.

On Monday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that it has not been updated on the progress of talks between Ukraine and the U.S. “We have, of course, been closely monitoring media reports that have been pouring in over the past few days, including from Geneva. But we haven’t received anything official yet,” he said.

There were no plans for a meeting between Russian and American delegations this week, he added.",figurative
"Opinion: A royal seal of approval

toggle caption Leon Neal/Getty Images

People celebrating this holiday weekend may have different ideas about what sparked the American Revolution: a yearning for liberty; a revulsion at taxation without representation; or a desire to have a national sport where players can touch the ball with their hands.

And of course, disdain for King George III. ""He has plundered our seas,"" America's Founders wrote in the Declaration of Independence, ""ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.""

Today's British monarchy might not be powerful enough to fix a traffic ticket for a prince. But the royal family can still be potent influencers, as we use the term today.

Sponsor Message

This week it was announced that starting next year, the Prince and Princess of Wales will begin to grant the Royal Warrants that confer the crown's seal of approval on certain goods and services.

King Charles and Queen Camilla have granted more than 400 such warrants, and it's interesting to sift through the list of what met royal muster.

The list includes familiar British names, like Bentley and Jaguar motorcars, Burberry outfitters, Smythson Stationers, Turnbull and Asser Shirtmakers, and Twining's Tea and Coffee.

But there's also the ribbon and tassel manufacturer Cole Fabrics — the royal family must go through a lot of tassels — the artisanal Besom Broom and Pea Stick maker A. Nash, Change Waste Recycling Management Services, and Milborrow Chimney Sweeps. Buckingham Palace alone has hundreds of chimneys. Chim-Chim-Cheree!

""In luxury brand marketing,"" Professor Qing Wang of the University of Warwick in Coventry, England, told us, ""the image of the British royal family coats of arms is a strong cue for quality, a touch of class that makes it popular, even especially among American consumers.""

And so it may not surprise that this week the JL Partners polling firm released a survey of 1,000 U.S. voters in which 19% said they favor replacing the sitting U.S. President with the British monarch. More than one in three of 19 to 29-year-olds surveyed said they would favor a restoration of royalty.

"Chef Nite Yun showcases flavors of her parents' home in new cookbook, 'My Cambodia'

toggle caption Andria Lo/Ten Speed Press

When Nite Yun cooks, she's telling her family's story.

The Cambodian-American chef, best known for her restaurant Lunette in San Francisco, has long used food to honor her parents' country. But as she was growing up in Stockton, Calif., her parents rarely talked about their life in Cambodia and the genocide they fled in the 1970s.

""My parents dodged landmines, survived starvation, forced labor camps, walked under the hot, hot sun to safety,"" Yun told NPR's Leila Fadel.

It was in the kitchen that she began to piece their story together.

""Cooking Cambodian food has been a way of storytelling,"" she said.

Sponsor Message

Now Yun is sharing those stories and her recipes with the world in her debut cookbook called My Cambodia: A Khmer Cookbook.

""My Cambodia is my story. My parents' story of resilience and strength,"" she said. ""I also wanted people to not forget the good times of Cambodia when my parents were growing up.""

Among the dishes she features is kroeung, a fragrant herb paste that forms the base of Khmer cooking. Made from lemongrass, galangal, turmeric, garlic, shallots and lime leaves, kroeung is used in soups, stews and curry. Yun shared a recipe for kroeung with Morning Edition, which you can find below. As she writes, ""you simply cannot talk about or cook Khmer food without it.

MASTER KROEUNG

toggle caption Nicola Parisi/Ten Speed Press

Makes 2 cups

8 large or 12 small lemongrass stalks, trimmed and thinly sliced (2 cups)

3-inch piece galangal, thinly sliced (1/2 cup)

1/2 cup chopped garlic (15 to 25 cloves, 1 to 2 heads garlic)

1 small shallot, chopped (1/4 cup)

10 makrut lime leaves, center veins removed, thinly sliced

Place the lemongrass in a mortar and smash it into a paste with the pestle (see Note). Add the galangal and smash it with the lemongrass until it has the consistency of a paste. Add the garlic and smash, then repeat with the shallot. Finally, add the lime leaves a little bit at a time, smashing as you go. The ingredients should barely come together into a paste.

Sponsor Message

To finish, stir everything together. Doesn't it smell lovely? It's ready to use. To store, refrigerate the kroeung in an airtight container for up to 3 days. To freeze, portion the kroeung into ½-cup containers or resealable bags. It'll keep for up to 2 months.

Note: The key to great kroeung is in the smashing of the ingredients. Crushing each ingredient in the mortar will break down the fibers and release aromatic oils and flavors in a way that tearing and shredding will not. That said, if you don't have a mortar and pestle, a food processor is the next best thing: Place all the ingredients in the bowl of the processor and pulse several times until it turns into a paste. If the ingredients aren't combining, add a little bit of grapeseed or another neutral oil to help things move along.

"It should come as no surprise that the new album by Oneohtrix Point Never comes with a concept attached. They usually do. When not composing film soundtracks, or producing an eclectic range of other artists – the Weeknd, Anohni, Charli xcx, Soccer Mommy – Daniel Lopatin has released a string of acclaimed works, each with their own overarching idea.

The “hyperreal world music” of 2010’s Returnal was inspired by the fact that people now see more of the world than ever without actually leaving their homes. In 2015, Garden of Delete had an accompanying origin story about an adolescent humanoid alien called Ezra; 2018’s Age Of imagined artificial intelligence attempting to recreate human culture after humans themselves had been rendered extinct. Lopatin also has an all-consuming obsession with nostalgia and forgotten pop cultural artefacts: he’s made albums based around warped loops of 80s pop hits, preset sounds on obsolete synthesisers and recordings of US radio stations changing formats, discarding the musical genres in which they previously specialised in favour of the current vogue.

View image in fullscreen The artwork for Tranquilizer. Photograph: Warp Records

All of which makes Tranquilizer very much in the Oneohtrix Point Never wheelhouse. It feels not unlike a sequel to Replica, released 14 years ago. On that album, Lopatin drew on sounds from a collection of bootleg DVDs he bought online compiling old TV adverts from the 80s and 90s. Tranquilizer is constructed from a cache of old sample CDs – pre-packaged collections of royalty-free sounds that used to be sold to musicians and producers in the 90s and early 00s – that Lopatin found uploaded to the Internet Archive. An extra frisson came when, after bookmarking the page for future use, he discovered that it had been deleted. It subsequently reappeared, but it underlined the shakiness of the assumption that everything is preserved for ever in some corner of cyberspace.

There was something disorienting about the music on Replica, not least its use of minute snatches of spoken word: you’d hear the intake of breath and the first syllable of a voiceover, but the rest of the sentence would never appear, just a tiny fragment of its opening, looping or juddering. There’s something similarly unsettled about Tranquilizer. Sample CDs were frequently compiled along genre lines, labelled for use in drum’n’bass, or hip-hop, or house: from the start, the sounds on Tranquilizer strongly suggest that the CDs Lopatin downloaded were intended for those making ambient or new age music. For Residue opens with the sound of the ocean, some big, Pink Floyd-y guitar chords, wordless breathy vocals and thick, warm electronic tones. Elsewhere, you hear such obvious 90s ambient signifiers as tinkling windchime-like tones, Satie-esque piano figures, slow-paced non-specific “tribal” drums, the crackle of old vinyl and snatches of muted trumpet that recall the sound of late Brian Eno collaborator Jon Hassell. The synthesisers at the end of Modern Lust, meanwhile, are a dead ringer for those used on the KLF’s landmark album Chill Out.

Oneohtrix Point Never: Dis – video

Despite its title, Tranquilizer never feels particularly recumbent. Rather, it lulls the listener into a false sense of security with the familiarity of its sounds, then throws you for a loop. Sometimes the effect is straightforwardly unsettling, as when the patterns of the sounds on Bumpy run jarringly out of time, like a stuck record, or abruptly switch and change on Vestigel; or bend in pitch, lending a sickly, lightheaded air to Lifeworld. Sometimes the effect is overwhelming and euphoric: the shift during Rodl Glide, where a slow ooze of sound is dramatically replaced by full-on rave dynamics, or the sudden eruption of chattering synths midway through Dis. (In a startlingly Proustian period detail for listeners of a certain age, the track is also disrupted by the sound of speaker interference caused by an old 2G mobile phone.) Over five and half minutes, closer Waterfalls moves from windswept empty landscapes to busy urban propulsion, from passages that sound like the Japanese new age music collected on Visible Cloaks’ celebrated 2010 mix series Fairlights, Mallets and Bamboo to a burst of something that resembles an early 80s kids TV theme: the effect is heady and exhausting rather than relaxing.

For all the calm its source material was ostensibly intended to provoke, the record spends an hour in constant, agitated motion: chillout music transposed into an era where it’s increasingly difficult to chill out, where the constant bombardment of content and the dopamine hit of doomscrolling has made relaxing something we have to work at. Tranquilizer seems unlikely to help you calm down. It’s too kaleidoscopic and restless, too crammed with sounds: an album that demands – and repays – your full attention, rather than simply drifting by.

Up next The Dirt Pt 1 EP out now

As the internet spits out underground artists like mouthwash, it’s becoming harder to separate the visionaries from the vibe-hackers. But Pollyfromthedirt’s jagged pastoral pop demands more than just a passing scroll. Released independently this week, the County Durham native’s first EP clashes brass band samples, shuddering Midi strings and awkward acoustic guitar together. There’s a trace of Elliott Smith in his grey-skied songwriting, yet made entirely his own by the crude drum machines, pitched-up vocals and DIY production. At best, like the EP’s weirdest track, Kalm, the music departs from traditional song structure and coalesces into delay-steeped, swirling ambience.

He doesn’t share his real name and often performs masked, channelling a healthy dollop of Dean Blunt in both vibe and sound. His most immediate peers, though, might be his fellow UK vanguards Worldpeace DMT, Westside Cowboy and Aya. His witty realism cuts through in a crowded scene: new song Theres No Such Thing as England subtly riffs on the country’s growing right-wing nationalism as a metaphor for jilted romance and suburban bleakness – “There’s no such thing as England / There’s no such thing as us to me” – while A Weekend in Majorca lets those same feelings dissolve on a classic package holiday: “I’m a lover, I’m a brawler / For a weekend in Majorca.”

His descriptions of cold nights, broken-down cars, weird neighbours and teenage escapism all feel foggily familiar – attempts to reconfigure the frayed edges of memory from nostalgia into something new. Archie Forde

"Three is not a crowd: Béla Fleck, Edmar Castañeda and Antonio Sánchez are BEATrio

Shervin Lainez

Banjo, harp and drums are not exactly your typical jazz trio. But Béla Fleck, Edmar Castañeda and Antonio Sánchez make that combination come alive in a project they call the BEATrio. Sánchez jokes that it might be ""the world's most unlikely band.""

Their story traces back to 2019, when Fleck and Castañeda shared a duo set at the Big Ears Festival in Knoxville, captured on video by Jazz Night in America. When Sánchez later invited Fleck to record for a studio project, Castañeda joined the session, and the three quickly discovered how naturally their sounds fit together despite coming from very different musical traditions.

Fleck is a banjo virtuoso who has redrawn the instrument's boundaries across genres. Castañeda has transformed the Colombian harp into an instrument capable of both rhythmic drive and harmonic flexibility. Sánchez is a drummer whose narrative approach to rhythm has made him one of the most distinctive voices on the instrument.

Shervin Lainez

""When we play together, we lock. It's like one person,"" Fleck says.

The BEATrio's debut recording, which came out in May, earned a Grammy nomination; a tour begins next year. This episode features music from the trio's self-titled album alongside the Fleck-Castañeda duo performance at Big Ears.

"The National Endowment for the Arts announced its 2026 class of NEA Jazz Masters today, continuing the legacy of what has been described as this country’s highest honor for living jazz musicians and advocates. The new honorees are singer and songwriter Carmen Lundy; keyboardist, singer and producer Patrice Rushen; percussionist and composer Airto Moreira; and broadcaster Rhonda Hamilton.

They represent a jazz generation that mostly came of age in the 1970s and ‘80s: with one exception, all of these incoming NEA Jazz Masters are now 71, and still active on the scene. Moreira is the outlier at 84, with a dazzling career that began in his native Brazil during the 1960s, and went on to include extensive work with Miles Davis and two pioneering jazz-rock bands, Weather Report and Return to Forever. He has released dozens of his own albums, often with his wife, the radiant singer Flora Purim.

Among the myriad musicians Airto has crossed paths with is Rushen: they played together on the 2015 album A Jazz Moment in Time. Rushen is the perfect embodiment of a jazz multi-hyphenate, having hit the scene in the early ‘70s as a post-bop piano prodigy, before shifting into a successful R&B career. (In pop culture, she’s best known for her 1982 hit “Forget Me Nots,” and its repurposing for the movie Men in Black.) Rushen has served for many years in the Popular Music program at USC, and she’s now receiving her due as a jazz headliner: she finally headlined this year at Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, and also at the San Francisco Jazz Festival.

There’s collaborative history between Rushen and Lundy, another member of this year’s class: they have recorded together on a number of occasions, including on Lundy’s 2017 album Code Noir. A vocalist of power and presence, Lundy has been a solo artist for more than 40 years, notably writing many of her own songs. Some of these have taken on sociopolitical themes, including mass gun violence and institutionalized racism. The title of Code Noir, in fact, refers to a decree by King Louis XIV in 1685, determining the conditions of slavery in the French colonies, which then included Louisiana. But the album also has its share of ruminative or yearning love songs.

Last but not least is Hamilton, recipient of the 2026 A.B. Spellman NEA Jazz Masters Award for Jazz Advocacy. A steadfast presence on the airwaves since 1979, when she was part of the team that helped establish Newark Public Radio, Hamilton is also known as a founding voice of jazz programming on Sirius Satellite Radio. Now based on the west coast, she can be heard on the air at KJAZZ, a jazz and blues station affiliated with Cal State Long Beach. Her past honors include the Willis Conover-Marian McPartland Excellence in Broadcasting Award from the Jazz Journalists Association.

“As we celebrate America’s 250th anniversary in 2026, the NEA is proud to also honor these individuals who have played a significant role in jazz, considered one of our country’s greatest cultural gifts to the world,” Mary Anne Carter, Senior Advisor to the NEA, says in a press announcement. “As with our nation, jazz is an art form with a rich heritage that continues to evolve, thanks to those who have dedicated their lives and creativity to this music over generations.”

The NEA will honor the 2026 Jazz Masters with a free concert on Saturday, April 18, 2026, at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. For more information about the program, the concert and the honorees, visit arts.gov.",figurative
"Cabin in the Sky, the tenth album by De La Soul – and first since the 2023 death of founding member Trugoy the Dove, AKA Dave Jolicoeur – is, loosely, a concept album about death and the afterlife. A spoken-word intro by actor Giancarlo Esposito primes you for something heavy, but you are instantly reminded, of course, that this is a De La Soul album: it seems practically impossible that their brand of lackadaisical, perpetually sunny plunderphonics could ever feel like a drag. The lush strings of Yuhdontstop introduce an album that’s always projected in full-saturation Technicolor: from the effervescent Natalie Cole sample on Will Be to Maseo’s jovial, avuncular ad-libs that open Cruel Summers Bring Fire Life!!, Cabin in the Sky feels warm and rich in vitamin D, a tonic for chillier months.

View image in fullscreen The artwork for Cabin in the Sky

For the most part, the afterlife theme seems to have been tacked on, likely after Trugoy’s death; the album still features his vocals, and most of the songs on the album fit squarely in De La Soul’s already established surrealist world. (Patty Cake, a minimalist highlight, reinterprets classic schoolyard chants, a conceit that somehow hasn’t already been done on a De La Soul record.) Even so, lasting more than 70 minutes, Cabin in the Sky can feel like a slog, with the end lacking the sprightliness of the album’s first half. An exception is the title track, on which Maseo and Pos pay tribute to Trugoy and others they’ve lost. It’s pensive and world-weary, but never loses its sense of magic.",literal
"Kicker Justin Tucker was reinstated 13 days after, after serving a 10-game suspension under the Personal Conduct Policy. His phone, by all appearances, had not rung.

It now has.

NFL Media reports that the Saints have invited Tucker to a kicker tryout. Cade York also will participate, per the report.

Some believed Tucker’s off-field baggage coupled with a lackluster 2024 season with the Ravens (73.3-percent field-goal conversion rate) would make it more difficult for him to get a shot. He’s now getting one, with the Saints.

Tucker, a five-time first-team All-Pro, was accused by multiple women of misconduct during massage-therapy sessions. He denied the allegations, and he was never charged criminally nor sued civilly. The league investigated after reporting earlier this year by the Baltimore Banner. Cut by the Ravens in May, Tucker accepted a 10-game suspension without a full-blown hearing or appeal.

Seven years ago, Tucker missed the first extra point of his career in the final seconds of a game against the Saints, resulting in a one-point loss by Baltimore.

Current Saints kicker Blake Grupe has missed eight of 26 field goals this season. On Sunday against the Falcons, Grupe missed a 38-yard field goal and a 47-yard field goal.",literal
"Dozens of young people wave their phone flashlights and sing along with a teen as she belts out lyrics and plays her keyboard outside a subway station.

It’s a scene that regularly plays out in cities around the world. But the singer in this widely shared video is now behind bars.

Diana Loginova, the 18-year-old student and street musician, has emerged as an unlikely — and perhaps unwilling — voice of defiance in wartime Russia.

Known by her stage name Naoko, the teen gained popularity over the summer with viral videos taken around St. Petersburg of her band Stoptime performing songs by musicians who have spoken out against Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine. Inevitably, in a country where nearly all forms of dissent have been crushed, Russian authorities quickly took notice.

Naoko was first detained last month for organizing a “mass simultaneous gathering of citizens” during a performance, which authorities said disrupted public order, and was sentenced to 13 days behind bars. She has since been rearrested twice on the same charges, as well as for petty hooliganism, and put back in prison. Her fellow band members have also served back-to-back sentences, although one has since been released.

“What is happening is what we call carousel arrests,” Dmitrii Anisimov, a human rights activist and spokesperson for the OVD-Info protest monitoring group, told NBC News. “Theoretically, it can continue forever,” he said. In practice, it could mean months in detention, and there is legal precedent for this, he added.

“It looks like Russian authorities want to use the persecution of Naoko, as with many other public cases, to intimidate others,” said Anisimov.

Loginova’s lawyer, Maria Zyryanova, told NBC News she wouldn’t discuss the case while the singer is behind bars. Her current sentence expires Sunday.

Naoko’s case has been extensively covered by Russian state news agencies and exiled independent media, while supporters have spread leaflets calling for her freedom.

In an interview published in August, months before her imprisonment, Naoko said she was “scared” to be detained but felt she “had to do it.”

“I understand that art is now the only language — at least in Russia — through which you can express your thoughts. I’ve chosen it and don’t want to speak any other,” she told St. Petersburg news outlet Bumaga.

Others have taken up that language in Loginova’s absence.

On a bench near the Kiyevskaya metro station in central Moscow, musician Vasily told NBC News that Naoko’s case had “lit a fire” in him, inspiring his own street performances as a way to support the jailed singer.

“Her freedom was taken away for her singing,” said Vasily, whose last name NBC News chose not to reveal for his safety. “That got me mad.”

Valentina, a professional musician from the city of Yaroslavl, about 380 miles southeast of St. Petersburg, has been singing on both the streets and social media in support of Naoko.

Inspired after seeing Naoko’s performances on TikTok, she has been posting videos where she performs the same songs. One gained more than 600,000 views on Instagram, which scared her because she did not want to get on authorities’ radar, said Valentina, who did not want her last name revealed for fear of repercussions. “When I saw the news about Naoko, it felt like my last hope was taken away,” she said. “I did not feel sorry for myself. I just really wanted to help. I thought, ‘Why do I berate people who keep silent and don’t say anything in our country when I am also remaining silent and scared?’”

Loginova is still a child, noted Vasily — himself only 19. “That’s what’s touched people, that this little girl is not afraid to get on the streets and sing the songs of foreign agents.”

He’s referencing the status of exiled singer Monetochka and rapper Noize MC, both slapped with the official designation often reserved for public figures whose views have set them at odds with the Kremlin.

It was a song by Noize MC, who has openly spoken out against the war and Putin’s regime, that Loginova performed before she first landed in jail.

The rapper’s lyrics that appear to have gotten her in the most trouble appear innocuous on the surface: “I want to watch a ballet, let the swans dance.”

It’s a reference to the failed 1991 coup attempt against the last Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, during which state TV showed the “Swan Lake” ballet on a continuous loop. It has since come to symbolize something dangerous in Putin’s Russia — change.

A video of the band’s cover of the song, which Loginova has said they performed rarely and not for the cameras, drew the ire of war supporters who questioned why the band was allowed to perform the songs of “traitors” and whether their performances were, in fact, concealed protests.

A representative for Noize MC said in an email that the rapper “prefers not to give interviews or public comments regarding this case — primarily to avoid any risk of unintentionally affecting those directly involved.”

Monetochka, whose songs the band also performed, hailed them as “heroes” in a statement on social media, saying that Loginova was bringing “music and freedom” into the world rather than “violence and war.” She did not respond to NBC News’ request for comment.

NBC News has reached out to Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov for comment on the case.

Kremlin critic Boris Nadezhdin, who was barred from running against Putin in last year’s election, said he had been in communication with Loginova’s mom, Irina, and was fundraising to cover the band’s legal costs.

He has also been raising awareness on social media and said people’s emotional reactions were palpable. “She is young, she is a female, and she is not at all a politician or journalist. People are used to repressions against opposition politicians and journalists, but this is a new low,” said Nadezhdin.

The people who came to listen to the band were also young, he added, a red flag for the Kremlin because of its predominantly older support base. “So they need to have an exemplary reprisal against some young singer,” he said, “so that others get fearful.”

While she garners sympathy at home and abroad, Loginova remains behind bars for her singing. Nadezhdin said he was not optimistic about her chances of performing again anytime soon.

“They won’t leave her alone quickly,” he said. “I am telling them to get ready for a long ride ahead.”",literal
"Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Baker Mayfield left Sunday’s Week 12 game against the Los Angeles Rams and watched the second half with a sling on his left arm after he appeared to injure his shoulder twice.

Mayfield was replaced by backup Teddy Bridgewater to begin the third quarter. When Mayfield did return to the sideline, he wore street clothes and a protective sling.

Mayfield had his left shoulder checked in the second quarter after he took a hard hit on a scramble, and he grimaced later in the drive after he threw a touchdown pass to Tez Johnson. He walked to a medical tent not moving his left arm.

After his left shoulder was checked between drives, Mayfield wound up to throw as far as he could on the final play before halftime, but after he threw an interception, he immediately reached for the same shoulder and was helped off the field.

Mayfield had endured a brutal first half as Tampa fell behind 31-7, completing nine of his 19 passes for 41 yards, a touchdown and two interceptions. He also was sacked twice.

A 5-1 start to the season, including four comebacks, put Mayfield into the conversation for the NFL's most valuable player in October, as he produced 12 touchdown passes against just one interception. But the Buccaneers then lost three of their next four games to fall to 6-4 entering Sunday's matchup with the Rams.",literal

"Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has identified the young woman who was set on fire last week while she was riding a Chicago Transit Authority train as Bethany MaGee, 26.

Duffy, in a post on X, also blamed ""Chicago’s carelessness"" for the attack, saying it would have never happened had the suspect ""been behind bars.""

""Yet Chicago lets repeat offenders roam the streets,"" Duffy wrote.

The suspect, Lawrence Reed, 50, has a history of mental illness and has been arrested 72 times since he turned 18, most recently in August, when he was charged with aggravated battery after a social worker was struck, Chicago media reported.

Over the objections of state prosecutors, Reed was released and put on electronic monitoring. Since then, he has violated the terms of his probation a half-dozen times, including the day of the attack, NBC Chicago reported.

Mayor Brandon Johnson on Monday said he would not confirm the woman's identity ""out of respect for the family's wishes.""

""This was a tragic incident, and the Mayor's prayers are with the victim and her family,"" he said in a statement.

At a news conference last week, Johnson said the Nov. 17 attack""should have never happened"" and characterized the violence as ""an absolute failure of our criminal justice as well as our mental health institutions.""

He said the suspect was clearly mentally disturbed and a danger to himself and the community — ""and now we have a woman who is fighting for her life,"" the mayor said.

President Donald Trump and members of his administration have routinely claimed that cities run by Democrats, like Johnson, have high crime rates.

When NBC News reached out to the Chicago Police Department to confirm Duffy's naming of MaGee, a spokesperson emailed that ""our office does not identify victims.""

There was also no immediate response from MaGee's family to Duffy's announcement. Calls to a phone number believed to belong to her family went unanswered.

Last week the family of the victim, who is being cared for at Stroger Hospital, released a statement that thanked ""everyone for their prayers and well-wishes as our daughter receives care for injuries sustained earlier this week.”

Duffy's post Sunday appeared several days after federal prosecutors charged Reed with one count of committing a terrorist attack or other violence against a mass transportation system in the Northern District of Illinois.

At the court hearing Wednesday, Reed repeatedly yelled “I plead guilty!” as soon as he entered the courtroom, according to NBC Chicago.

Reed declined counsel and tried to drown out the judge by singing out loud. The judge and the prosecutor agreed Reed should have a mental evaluation.

If he is convicted, Reed faces a maximum penalty of life in prison.

The woman was attacked just before 9:30 p.m. a week ago on a CTA blue line train.

Security video captured the man authorities identified as Reed holding a bottle and approaching the victim, who was sitting with her back to him. It showed him suddenly pouring a liquid over her head and trying to ignite it.

The woman, according to the complaint, fought him off and then ran toward the front of the train car with the man chasing after her.

The man quickly caught up with her and set the woman ablaze, the complaint said. He then “stood watching” as “her body was engulfed in flames.""

The woman was “almost fully engulfed in flames” and tried to roll to put out the blaze, the complaint said.",figurative
"KYIV, Ukraine — Russia launched a wave of attacks on Ukraine’s capital Kyiv early Tuesday, striking residential buildings and energy infrastructure, according to video footage and local authorities.

A residential building in the central Pechersk district and another in Kyiv’s eastern district of Dniprovskyi were badly damaged, Mayor Vitalii Kitschko said.

Video footage posted to Telegram showed a large fire spread through multiple floors of the nine-story building in Dniprovskyi. At least four people were injured, the head of Kyiv city administration, Tymor Tkachenko, said.

Ukraine’s energy ministry said that energy infrastructure had been hit, without specifying what type or the extent of the damage.

The Russian attack followed talks between U.S. and Ukraine representatives in Geneva on Sunday about a U.S.-Russia brokered peace plan.

Oleksandr Bevz, a delegate from the Ukrainian side, told The Associated Press on Monday that the talks had been “very constructive” and the two sides were able to discuss most points.

"Two million people continue to face hunger and thirst, while more than 460 Palestinians have died from starvation.

Despite a ceasefire deal with Israel, Palestinians across the devastated Gaza Strip continue to go hungry as food supplies remain critically low and aid fails to reach those who need it most.

As per the ceasefire agreement, Israel was supposed to allow 600 humanitarian aid trucks into Gaza per day. However, Israel has since reduced the limit to 300 trucks per day, citing delays in retrieving bodies of Israeli captives buried under the rubble by Israeli attacks.

According to the UN2720 Monitoring and Tracking Dashboard, which monitors humanitarian aid being offloaded, collected, delivered and intercepted on its way into Gaza, from October 10-16, only 216 trucks have reached their intended destinations inside Gaza.

According to truck drivers, aid deliveries are facing significant delays, with Israeli inspections taking much longer than expected.

Satellite images captured by Planet Labs on October 14 and 15 show a large number of trucks queuing on the Egyptian side of the Rafah crossing and heading towards the Kerem Abu Salem crossing.

‘Palestinians want food’

While some food aid has trickled in over the past few days, medical equipment, therapeutic nutrition and medicines are still in extremely short supply, despite being desperately needed by the most impoverished, particularly malnourished children.

Reporting from Deir el-Balah, in central Gaza, Al Jazeera’s Hind Khoudary said some commercial trucks have entered Gaza over the past few days, but most Palestinians do not have the ability to buy any of the items they are bringing in as they have spent all of their savings in the past two years.

So far, what has arrived in the trucks includes “wheat, rice, sugar, oil, fuel and cooking gas”, she said.

While food distribution points are expected to open for parcels and other humanitarian aid, people in Gaza have yet to receive them. “Palestinians want food, they want shelter, they want medicine,” Khoudary said.

She added that even 600 trucks a day would be insufficient to meet the needs of Gaza’s entire population.

Food ‘is not a bargaining chip’

The UN humanitarian chief, Tom Fletcher, has urged Israel to open more border crossings for humanitarian aid.

“We need more crossings open and a genuine, practical, problem-solving approach to removing remaining obstacles. Throughout this crisis, we have insisted that withholding aid from civilians is not a bargaining chip. Facilitation of aid is a legal obligation,” Fletcher said.

Since the ceasefire began, 137 World Food Programme trucks have entered Gaza as of October 14, delivering supplies to bakeries and supporting nutrition and food distribution programmes.

With the ceasefire in effect, WFP is now scaling up. 🔹137 trucks have already entered #Gaza — supporting bakeries, nutrition, and food distributions. 🔹170,000+ MT of food ready to move, enough to feed 2M people.

Israeli authorities continue to block UNRWA

The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) – the primary and largest organisation providing aid to Palestinians – has faced significant restrictions imposed by Israel.

The agency, which was responsible for delivering food, medical care, education and emergency assistance, says it has enough food aid in warehouses in Jordan and Egypt to supply the people in Gaza for three months.

This includes food parcels for 1.1 million people and flour for 2.1 million, and shelter supplies sufficient for up to 1.3 million individuals.

However, despite the ceasefire, Israeli authorities are continuing to block them from entering.

UNRWA has enough food outside #Gaza to supply people there for three months, amid desperate need. Our teams stand ready to deliver it. But despite the #ceasefire, the Israeli Authorities’ block on UNRWA bringing any supplies into Gaza still continues after over 7 months.

Malnutrition among children

As of October 12, at least 463 people, including 157 children, have died from starvation amid Israel’s blockade of the Gaza Strip. Nearly one in four children suffers from severe acute malnutrition.

After prolonged starvation, food must be reintroduced carefully under medical supervision to avoid re-feeding syndrome, a potentially fatal condition in which sudden intake of nutrients causes dangerous shifts in electrolytes, affecting the heart, nerves and muscles. A larger supply of nutritional aid, given safely, could dramatically save lives.

According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), 90 percent of children in Gaza less than two years of age consume fewer than two food groups each day, which doesn’t include protein-rich foods.

At least 290,000 children between the ages of six months and 5 years, and 150,000 pregnant and breastfeeding women require feeding and micronutrient supplies.

In addition to this, there are an estimated 132,000 cases of children less than the age of five, and 55,000 pregnant and breastfeeding women projected to be suffering from acute malnutrition by June 2026, if immediate food aid isn’t made available.",literal
"This week brings new books grappling with the endings of relationships and eras

NPR

It feels fitting, in a way, that so many notable books this week are premised on endings — of lives, relationships, eras, even. After all, Armistice Day, or Remembrance Day — also known as Veterans Day in the U.S. – is Tuesday. The day annually marks the end of one of history's most catastrophic conflicts, World War I.

For the most part, the endings that animate many of this week's new novels don't seek such world-historical consequence. Ann Packer, Quiara Alegria Hudes and the other authors who grace the list below are concerned with much more intimate details, the kind you're more likely to encounter just down the street than on a battlefield or at an international summit.

That said, the twisty history of currency — the subject of this week's one nonfiction entry in the roundup — reinforces a lesson learned with the peace of 1918: Beware of endings; they have the odd habit of being yet another beginning in disguise.

Some Bright Nowhere, by Ann Packer

Ann Packer's first novel in a decade finds the American author again pursuing a deceptively simple premise: A long-married couple must prepare for and confront their final weeks together before death comes for one of them. But don't be fooled by the saccharine-sounding summary. As Fresh Air's Maureen Corrigan explained in a review of Packer's previous novel, The Children's Crusade, the author has a knack for turning what might have been ""mundane mass-market fiction"" into a rich, splintered narrative that ""illuminate[s] the unexpected depths of the commonplace.""

In The White Hot, she explores a departure, in the voice of a young mother who tries to understand and explain her decision to leave her family for the freedom of a one-way ticket far, far away.

The Silver Book, by Olivia Laing

Laing's writing roams a Venn diagram of memoir, art criticism, history and fiction, rarely pursuing just one genre without including at least some elements of the others. Her memoir The Lonely City, for instance, wove the stuff of academic journals into a chronicle of her life in New York City. Her only previous novel, Crudo, dressed up in the persona of author Kathy Acker for an exercise that NPR's reviewer admiringly called a ""memoir in drag."" For its part, The Silver Book, though a novel, sets its inventions in an especially consequential – and controversial – era of Italian cinema: the final year or two before the brutal, unsolved murder of director Pier Paolo Pasolini.

"At least 80,000 people displaced as Sudan’s humanitarian crisis deepens after the RSF’s capture of el-Fasher.

In western Sudan, the number of people fleeing el-Fasher and its surrounding villages in North Darfur in search of safety is rising.

As of Tuesday, the International Organization for Migration estimated that 81,817 people have been displaced in the area – most on foot – since the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) seized the city on October 26, ending an 18-month siege and driving out the Sudanese army.

Many of the displaced have sought refuge in different parts of el-Fasher, the capital of North Darfur State, and in the nearby town of Tawila.

Thousands of people inside the city are feared to have been killed since the RSF took control.

The United Nations and international aid agencies have confirmed numerous accounts from survivors reporting that RSF fighters have carried out mass executions, torture, rape and sexual abuse and have held people for ransom. Famine is spreading while outbreaks of cholera and other deadly diseases continue to rise.

More than 9.5 million people displaced

According to the UN, Sudan is facing the world’s largest humanitarian and displacement crisis with more than 9.5 million people internally displaced across 10,929 locations in 185 localities, spanning all 18 states of Sudan.

Most of the displaced have sought refuge in South Darfur (1.84 million), North Darfur (1.75 million) and Central Darfur (978,000). More than half, or 51 percent, of those displaced are children under the age of 18.

Sudan’s civil war between Sudan’s military and the RSF began on April 15, 2023, and both sides have been accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity. The RSF has also been implicated in atrocities in Darfur that the UN said may amount to genocide.

Even before the current war began, the International Organization for Migration estimated that more than 2.32 million people had already been displaced in Sudan, mostly in Darfur, due to years of conflict and climate-driven crises.

Since April 2023, an additional 7.25 million people have been displaced within Sudan, including around 2.7 million from Khartoum State, 2 million from South Darfur and a similar number from North Darfur.

More than 4.3 million refugees

In addition to 9.58 million internally displaced people, an estimated 4.34 million have fled to neighbouring countries as refugees, bringing the total number of displaced across Sudan to 14 million – more than a quarter of the country’s 51 million population.

Most have sought refuge in Egypt (1.5 million), South Sudan (1.25 million) and Chad (1.2 million). Of those who fled, about 70 percent are Sudanese nationals while 30 percent are non-Sudanese.",literal
"Whether you’re power-walking through the neighborhood, on your feet from 9 to 5, or constantly chasing after small, fast-moving humans, a comfortable, slip-resistant shoe with real support isn’t a luxury — it’s a necessity.

Experts say that, if you can swing it, your best bet is to get properly fitted at a specialty running store — especially if you deal with foot pain or conditions like plantar fasciitis. But here’s the good news: many of the most recommended walking-shoe brands from those stores — think Brooks, ASICS, Saucony, Skechers, and New Balance — are also just a few clicks away on Amazon.

Below, I gathered a list of highly rated walking sneakers with expert advice in mind. Your feet (and your schedule) will thank you.

How I picked the best walking shoes for women from Amazon

In a previous guide on best women’s walking shoes, podiatrists Olga Shvets and Miguel Cunha said the first step to buying the right walking shoe is knowing what type of arch support you need — neutral, low or high. This depends on knowing whether your foot type is pronator (when your ankle or arch rolls or tips inward slightly), supinator (when your weight rolls onto the outer edges of your feet) or neutral (when your foot lands on your heel and rolls forward so that your impact is distributed evenly). If buying online, Shvets recommends looking at a well-worn pair of sneakers you already own to see where they are worn out.

Here are some of the other important factors our experts provided when we were coming up with our list of the best walking shoes on Amazon:

Arch support: Shoes with good arch support will be comfortable for longer. Look for a footbed made of memory foam or an ethyl vinyl acetate (EVA) anti-compression insole for maximum comfort.

Shoes with good arch support will be comfortable for longer. Look for a footbed made of memory foam or an ethyl vinyl acetate (EVA) anti-compression insole for maximum comfort. Comfortable uppers: Look for flexible uppers that are made from durable materials, so they last. A breathable fabric is also a smart choice to allow for maximum ventilation to avoid moisture that can cause Athlete’s foot or other complications from fungus.

To help you shop for a great-quality walking shoe on Amazon, I’ve rounded up 10 of the best options in line with our expert guidance, as well as some highly rated brands that are breathable, lightweight, provide excellent arch support and more. I’ve also included options in every price range, from the most budget-friendly to the most splurge-worthy.

These sneakers were tested for the NBC Select Wellness Awards and were a big hit amongst many staffers. “These are so well-cushioned that I can wear them all day,” says NBC Select associate SEO reporter Ashley Morris, who has flat feet. The sneakers have a wider toe box and soft cushioning for all-day wear.

These mesh slip-on shoes are breathable and lightweight and include a sock liner that adapts to your foot while you walk, according to the brand. The insole is made of Skechers’ Gogo Max technology, which provides added cushioning and support, according to Skechers. The Go Joy comes in medium, narrow and wide sizes and 37 color options, including hot pink, red, charcoal, black and taupe.

A favorite of Cunha, the Guide 15 has been redesigned with thicker cushioning and higher sidewalls for better stability. They also have a thick sole from heel to toe to absorb impact. “I always recommend this shoe because it delivers a softer heel strike and takes some stress off the foot,” he says.

Hoka’s Rincon 4 is lightweight yet highly cushioned. These sneakers have 3 millimeters of additional stacked height compared to previous versions. The shoes are intended for the gym or strength training sessions and offer neutral stability, according to the brand. They have a padded collar and tongue for comfort and the upper is made from a breathable double jacquard that is durable, according to the brand.

The v13 was designed for walkers and average runners who aren’t focused on speed, according to the brand. Shvets likes this shoe for the additional cushioning that helps absorb impact and protect the joints. These shoes can also accommodate orthotics comfortably and are great for the elderly population, says Shvets.

These sneakers have a leather upper and rubber soles to provide grip as you walk. They’re made with a memory foam sole for cushioning and the way they are constructed moves air from your heel to your forefoot and back to keep feet cool, according to the brand.

These popular shoes are lightweight and breathable and have extra padding in the sole and heel collar for added comfort. They’re also machine washable for easy cleaning.

These sneakers are a NBC Select Wellness Award winner and one of the best walking shoes. They slip on, though they look as though they have laces. The shoes have thick foam cushioning that is bouncy and supportive to provide comfort all day.

Another highly rated slip-on, the Doussprt is made of mesh fabric and has an elastic cuff for easy on and off. Its perforated arch is designed for extra ventilation and its air cushion technology provides a buffer between you and the ground to help protect you from injury, according to Doussprt. The footbed is made of mesh and EVA for added arch support. They also have a slip-resistant heel and a wide, round toe, which make these ideal for those who need to stand for long periods, according to the brand.

Like the Doussprt, this STQ walking shoe is made of breathable mesh fabric with a wide, round toe, so they are comfortable enough for all-day standing, according to the brand. Best for those requiring low arch support, these shoes have a thick sole with air cushioning to help absorb the impact as you walk. At just under 1 pound, the STQ is extremely lightweight. These mesh slip-ons are machine washable and come in 13 colors, including taupe, dark grey, navy and purple.

"Opinion: Remembering Sandra Grimes, mole hunter

Enlarge this image toggle caption Nikki Kahn/The Washington Post via Getty Images Nikki Kahn/The Washington Post via Getty Images

Before Sandra Grimes became a mole hunter, she'd been ready to scale back. ""I was not old enough at the time to retire,"" Grimes said in an interview for the National Security Archive at George Washington University, ""but I was satisfied professionally. I had a family that I wanted to spend more time with.""

It was 1991. Sandra Grimes had spent more than two decades with the CIA. But she agreed to stay on to help a colleague investigate why the agency's informants in the Soviet Union had ""gone dark,"" as they say in spycraft, in 1985 and 1986. They learned they had been identified, interrogated, and often executed.

""It was a terrible, terrible reminder of the seriousness of what we did for a living,"" Sandra Grimes said in that National Security Archive interview. ""We owed all these people who had made the sacrifice.""

Their investigation led them to look closely at Aldrich Ames, whom they knew as ""Rick."" He was the CIA's counterintelligence chief for Soviet operations, and knew about all of the agency's informants in the USSR.

Rick Ames had episodes of public drunkenness, carried on affairs, which triggered an expensive divorce, and married one of his old informants. He started wearing tailored suits, had his teeth capped, then paid cash for a new house and bought a Jaguar. All on a civil servant's salary.

Sandra Grimes scrutinized activity logs and financial statements and noticed that three times after Ames had lunch with a Soviet embassy official in Washington, D.C., he deposited thousands into his bank account.

""Well, three matches don't make a conviction, but in my mind, Rick was the spy,"" Sandra Grimes recollected. ""It didn't take a rocket scientist to add one plus one plus one.""

Aldrich Ames was arrested in 1994 and pled guilty to espionage, after taking millions of dollars for his spy work for the Soviet Union. He is still serving a life sentence.

Sandra Grimes died on July 25 at the age of 79. Her work was crucial in catching and stopping a Soviet agent who, the Senate Intelligence Committee said, ""caused more damage to the national security of the United States than any spy in the history of the CIA.""",figurative

There are some people so endlessly inventive that it's almost impossible to imagine them getting writer's block. David Byrne is one of those people.

In 1975, Byrne, along with bassist Tina Weymouth and drummer Chris Frantz, founded Talking Heads — a band that was a trailblazer in the new wave scene and went on to release several highly influential albums. Byrne is also a prolific solo artist who follows his curiosity in every direction, from sound collage and film scores to theater and dance, including his recent Broadway show for his album American Utopia.

But before writing his new album, Who Is the Sky?, it finally happened: Byrne got writer's block.

In this session, Byrne talks about what happened, how he eventually started writing again, his joyful new album and the vibrant new stage show for his current tour.

"Dhaka says New Delhi has an ‘obligatory responsibility’ to hand over the former leader, who was recently sentenced to death for last year’s deadly crackdown on a student-led uprising.

Bangladesh has again asked India to extradite former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who was recently sentenced to death in absentia over last year’s deadly crackdown against a student-led uprising.

Touhid Hossain, who holds the foreign affairs portfolio in Bangladesh’s interim administration, on Sunday said Dhaka had sent a letter two days ago, urging New Delhi to hand over the fugitive ex-leader.

Hasina, 78, has been in hiding in India – her close ally when she was the prime minister of Bangladesh for 15 years, until her autocratic rule was overthrown in a mass uprising in August 2024, in which more than 1,400 people were killed, according to the United Nations.

On Monday, a special International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) in Dhaka convicted Hasina of crimes against humanity and sentenced her to death, fulfilling a key pledge by the interim government, led by Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus.

Following the court ruling, Bangladesh’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement that India had an “obligatory responsibility” under a bilateral extradition treaty signed in 2013 to facilitate the former leader’s return.

The ministry said keeping Hasina is a “grave act of unfriendly behaviour”, and called it “a travesty of justice for any other country to grant asylum to these individuals convicted of crimes against humanity”.

India’s Foreign Ministry responded by saying it had “noted” the Hasina verdict. But India has so far not commented on the prospects of her extradition. Bangladeshi newspaper Prothom Alo says Dhaka has made at least three such extradition requests so far.

India’s past support for Hasina has frayed relations between the two South Asian neighbours since her overthrow.

But tensions appear to have eased slightly this week after Bangladesh’s National Security Adviser Khalilur Rahman visited India for a regional security summit, where he also met his Indian counterpart, Ajit Doval.

Media reports in Bangladesh said Rahman has invited Doval for a visit.

Bangladesh will hold its first general elections since the protests in February. Hasina’s party, the Awami League, is barred from any political activity.",literal
"Earlier this week, a flight carrying 153 Palestinians from Gaza landed in South Africa without documentation. The passengers were stuck on the plane for 12 hours before the South African authorities, who claimed they had not been informed by Israelis about the deportation flight, allowed them to disembark on humanitarian grounds.

The Palestinians on board had paid between $1,500 and $5,000 to a company called Al-Majd Europe to leave Gaza. The operation is run by a few Palestinians on the ground in coordination with the Israeli occupation authorities. At least two other such flights had already been made since June this year.

This is the latest scheme Israel is deploying to depopulate Gaza – a longstanding goal of its apartheid regime that goes back to the early 20th century.

Since the beginning of the Zionist movement, Palestinians have been perceived as a demographic obstacle to establishing a Jewish state. In the late 19th century, Theodor Herzl, one of the founding fathers of Zionism, wrote that the displacement of Arabs from Palestine must be part of the Zionist plan, suggesting that poor populations could be moved across borders and deprived of employment opportunities in a quiet and cautious manner.

In 1938, David Ben-Gurion, a key Zionist leader who would later become Israel’s first prime minister, made clear he supported forced “relocation” and saw nothing “immoral” in it. Part of this vision was carried out 10 years later during the Nakba of 1948, when more than 700,000 Palestinians were forced out of their homes in what Israeli historian Benny Morris has called “necessary” ethnic cleansing.

Advertisement

After 1948, Israel continued efforts to displace Palestinians. In the 1950s, tens of thousands of Palestinians and Palestinian Bedouins were forcibly transferred from the Naqab (Negev) desert to the Sinai Peninsula or Gaza, which was under Egyptian administration at that time.

After the June 1967 war, when Israel occupied Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem, it adopted a strategy of what it called “voluntary migration”. The idea was to create harsh living conditions to pressure residents to leave, including demolishing homes and reducing employment opportunities.

In parallel, “emigration offices” were established in the refugee camps of Gaza to encourage people who have lost any hope of return to their homes to leave in exchange for money and travel arrangements. Israel also encouraged Palestinians to go work abroad, especially in the Gulf. The price Palestinians had to pay for leaving was never being allowed to come back.

After October 7, 2023, Israel saw another chance to carry out its plan of ethnically cleansing Gaza – this time through genocide and forced expulsion. It thought it had the necessary international sympathy and diplomatic capital to carry out such an atrocity, as statements by various Israeli officials, such as ministers Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, show. They even came up with the so-called “General’s Plan” to fully depopulate northern Gaza.

The new scheme for forcing Palestinians out of Gaza fits well into this historical pattern. What distinguishes it, however, is that Palestinians are made to pay for their own forced displacement and their desperation is exploited by Palestinian collaborators who seek to make easy profit. This, of course, is meant to further the financial depletion of the Palestinian population and create more internal fissures and tensions.

This scheme, like previous ones, also has the central feature of denying Palestinians return. None of the passengers on the plane received Israeli exit stamps on their passports, which was the reason the South African authorities struggled with the admission process. Having no legal record of leaving the Israeli-occupied territory of Gaza means these people are automatically classified as illegal migrants and have no possibility of returning.

It is important here to clarify why Israel is allowing these flights to take place while impeding the evacuation of ill and injured Palestinians and students accepted in foreign universities. These exits of patients and students would be legal, and they imply the right to return – something Israel does not want to allow.

Advertisement

That there are Palestinians willing to fall for this flight scheme is unsurprising. Two years of genocide have driven the people of Gaza to unimaginable desperation. There are that many Gaza residents who would willingly board those planes. And yet, Israel cannot fly us all to South Africa.

Through decades of Zionist occupation, Palestinians have persevered. Palestinian steadfastness in the face of wars, sieges, home raids, demolitions, land theft, and economic subjugation confirms that the Palestinian land is not merely a place to live, but a symbol of identity and history that people are not willing to give up.

In the past two years, Israel has destroyed the lives and homes of two million Palestinians. And even that has failed to kill the Palestinian spirit and drive to hold onto the Palestinian land. The Palestinians are not flying out; we are here to stay.

"Opinion: 'Free speech doesn't work just when you agree with it'

toggle caption Erin Hooley/AP

In 1977, a neo-Nazi group called the National Socialist Party of America applied for a permit to march through Skokie, Illinois, a predominantly Jewish, Chicago suburb. They wanted to wear brown shirts with swastika armbands and wave signs demanding ""free speech for white people.""

The village refused the permit. The group sued, and it ignited a national debate over the First Amendment that may sound familiar today. Does the constitutional right to free speech protect offensive, even hateful speech? Can words cause real damage?

Skokie's attorneys argued that seeing the swastika and hearing chants of ""Sieg Heil"" on their streets would amount to a physical attack on the hundreds of Holocaust survivors who lived in Skokie.

I remember speaking with Magda Brown over iced tea on her porch. She'd been a teenager in Hungary when the Nazi-aligned government began making anti-Jewish laws. She survived Auschwitz and Buchenwald. Her family was executed.

""The thought of Nazis in our streets today,"" she told me, ""brings back my worst fears.""

I told Magda Brown that the young Chicago Nazis I'd interviewed in their small storefront headquarters looked more ridiculous than menacing. Magda answered, ""That's what the Nazis looked like to us in 1933, too,"" — the year Hitler came to power in Germany.

David Goldberger was the ACLU lawyer who argued in the U.S. Supreme Court for the right of the neo-Nazis to march and speak.

""But our real client was always the First Amendment,"" he told us this week. The courts eventually ruled that the planned demonstration was protected speech, but the Nazis ended up holding their rally in Chicago instead.

David Goldberger, who is now professor emeritus at The Ohio State University's law school, found the case personally painful. He himself is Jewish.

""I still feel bad about the pain it caused survivors,"" he said. ""People who had suffered so much. I felt like they could be my uncles and relatives.""

""But when free speech is denied because someone finds it offensive,"" he says today, ""then officials can prevent speech, even jokes, that anyone dislikes for any reason. Free speech doesn't work just when you agree with it.""

"Since the ceasefire took effect, Israeli attacks have killed at least 312 Palestinians and injured 760.

Since the declaration of a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, on October 10, 2025, Israel has violated the agreement with near-daily attacks, killing hundreds of people.

Israel violated the ceasefire agreement at least 393 times from October 10 to November 20, through the continuation of attacks by air, artillery and direct shootings, the Government Media Office in Gaza reports.

The office said Israel shot at civilians 113 times, raided residential areas beyond the “yellow line” 17 times, bombed and shelled Gaza 174 times, and demolished people’s properties on 85 occasions. It added that Israel had also detained 35 Palestinians from Gaza over the past month.

Israel has also continued to block vital humanitarian aid and destroy homes and infrastructure across the Strip.

Al Jazeera has tracked the ceasefire violations to date.

What are the terms of the ceasefire?

On September 29, the United States unveiled a 20-point proposal to end Israel’s war on Gaza, release the remaining captives held in the enclave, allow the full entry of humanitarian aid into the besieged territory and outline a three-phase withdrawal of Israeli forces.

Some of the main conditions of the first phase, which is ongoing, include:

An end to hostilities in Gaza by Israel and Hamas

Lifting the blockade of all aid into Gaza by Israel and stopping its interference in aid distribution

Release of all captives held in Gaza – alive or dead – by Hamas

Release of some 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and disappeared people from Israeli jails

Withdrawal of Israeli forces to the “yellow line”

Advertisement

Following mediation by partners including Egypt, Qatar, and Turkiye, representatives from some 30 countries gathered on October 13 for a ceremony to sign the Gaza ceasefire agreement, led by US President Donald Trump.

However, Israel and Hamas were notably absent, raising doubts about the summit’s ability to achieve tangible progress towards ending the war and resolving the core issues of Israel’s occupation and the 18-year-long siege of Gaza.

Israel has pledged not to allow a Palestinian state, and the US has continued its large-scale arms transfers and diplomatic backing to Israel throughout its genocidal war on Gaza, while offering only vague statements about Gaza’s future.

Israel attacks Gaza nearly every day

According to an analysis by Al Jazeera, Israel has attacked Gaza on 35 out of the past 42 days of the ceasefire, meaning there were only eight days during which no violent attacks, deaths or injuries were reported.

Despite continuing attacks, the US insists that the “ceasefire” is still holding.

Israel still killing Palestinians

Since the ceasefire took effect at noon on October 10, Israel has killed at least 312Palestinians and injured 760, according to the latest figures from the Palestinian Ministry of Health.

On October 19 and 29 – two of the deadliest days since the latest ceasefire – Israel killed a total of 154 people.

On October 19, accusing Hamas of violating the ceasefire after two Israeli soldiers were killed in Rafah, Israeli forces killed 45 people in a massive wave of air raids across the Gaza Strip.

Hamas’s armed wing, the Qassam Brigades, pointed out that Israel controls the Rafah area and it had no contact with any Palestinian fighters there.

On October 29, Israel killed 109 people, including 52 children, after an exchange of gunfire in Rafah that killed one Israeli soldier.

“The Israelis hit back, and they should hit back,” Trump told reporters, calling Israel’s attacks “retribution” for the soldier’s death.

Here are the latest figures from the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza, tracking the casualties from October 7, 2023, through November 20, 2025:

Confirmed killed: at least 69,546 people, including 20,179 children

at least 69,546 people, including 20,179 children Injured: at least 170,833 people

Israel still choking aid

The ceasefire stipulated that “full aid will be immediately sent into the Gaza Strip”. However, the reality on the ground remains very different.

According to the World Food Programme (WFP), only half the required food aid is currently reaching Gaza, while a coalition of Palestinian relief agencies says total aid deliveries amount to just one-quarter of what was agreed under the ceasefire.

Advertisement

From October 10 to November 20, only 5,037 trucks have reached their intended destinations inside Gaza, according to the UN2720 Monitoring and Tracking Dashboard, which monitors humanitarian aid in Gaza.

According to truck drivers, aid deliveries are facing significant delays, with Israeli inspections taking much longer than expected.

The White House says nearly 15,000 trucks carrying commercial goods and humanitarian aid have entered Gaza since October 10 to November 9, a figure sharply disputed by Palestinians and aid groups.

In addition, Israel has blocked essential and nutritious food items, including meat, dairy, and vegetables crucial for a balanced diet. Instead, non-nutritious foodstuffs are being allowed, such as snacks, chocolate, crisps, and soft drinks.

Has Hamas released all of the captives?

On October 13, as per the ceasefire deal, Hamas released all 20 remaining living Israeli captives in exchange for 250 Palestinians serving long prison sentences and 1,700 Palestinians disappeared by Israel since October 7, 2023.

As part of the deal, Hamas is also expected to return the bodies of 28 Israeli captives in exchange for 360 Palestinian bodies held by Israel.

As of November 20, Hamas had returned 25 Israeli captives’ bodies, with three remaining in Gaza. The group has said it requires heavy excavation equipment to recover the remaining bodies buried under the rubble from Israeli bombardment.

Israel has so far returned more than 300 Palestinian bodies, many of which were mutilated and showed signs of torture. Many remain unidentified.

What does international law say about ceasefires?

According to the Lieber Institute, a ceasefire is designed to halt active combat, or “freeze a conflict in place”, but it can be ambiguous in international law.

The suspension of hostilities is best understood as a cessation of active hostile military operations.

Resuming hostilities would breach political agreements, but it might not be a violation of international law unless the ceasefire was part of a binding treaty or United Nations Security Council resolution.",figurative
"Shopping early Black Friday sales is no longer a suggestion — it’s a must. I’ve been talking to trend forecasters, supply chain managers, economists and consumer behavior specialists for weeks, and they have one main piece of advice for shoppers: hurry. Experts say items will likely go out of stock quickly this year due to limited inventory, and while prices may not drop as low as usual due to tariffs, there’s plenty of worthwhile discounts out there. The sooner you shop, the more options you’ll get to browse through, and the longer you'll have to compare prices across retailers, weigh shipping options and hunt for coupons.

This is my sixth year covering Black Friday for NBC Select, so I know how to find deals that are actually worth buying. I spent weeks combing through thousands of discounts to find the best early Black Friday deals— each one I recommend below is highly rated and 20% off or more.

I also appreciate that the exterior of the cup doesn’t produce condensation, so whatever surface I put it on stays dry.

We recommend Brooklinen's Classic Percale sheets for hot sleepers because they have a cool, crisp feel, but almost everyone on our team likes using them. This set comes with a flat sheet, fitted sheet and pillowcases. You can buy it in twin to California king sizes.

4.2-star average rating from 119 reviews at Nordstrom

The Hoka Gaviota 5 is currently discounted across retailers in men’s and women’s sizes, and it’s one of our favorite walking shoes and running shoes with arch support. It has a built-in stabilizing system that’s especially beneficial for those with flat arches, a thick layer of plush cushioning that absorbs impact to protect your joints and a rocker-shaped outsole to encourage smooth heel-to-toe transitions. You can remove the sneakers’ insoles to add orthotics.

4.9-star average rating from 1,237 reviews at Calpak

“I bring almost my entire bathroom with me while traveling, and this cosmetic case is one of the only ones that can handle my excess of products,” says Rodriguez. “When I first used it, I was dumbfounded by how much of my makeup and skin care fit inside. It also feels luxe with its faux-leather exterior and gold zippers.” Since the cosmetics case is clear, you can always see what’s inside and easily wipe it down to clean as needed. It also comes in tiny, small and large sizes, all of which are on sale.

4.4-star average rating from 17 reviews at Hanna Andersson

I like to think of myself as somewhat of a pajama set connoisseur, and out of all the options I own, Hanna Andersson’s are my all-time favorite. I’ve bought them for adults and kids in my life, especially if I’m struggling with a gift idea, and there are lots of options if you’re looking for matching holiday pajamas the whole family can wear. This set is made from lightweight, buttery soft, moisture-wicking fabric and the top and bottoms both have a relaxed fit with piping detail. They fit true to size, in my experience.

"In July, Uzbekistan-born, Russian-speaking Israeli writer Dina Rubina gave an interview to the Russian opposition channel Rain TV, which caused a stir in the Russophone world. During the hour-and-a-half programme, she declared that there are no “peaceful residents” in Gaza, Israel has the right to “cleanse Gaza and turn it into a parking lot”, and that Palestinians need to be “dissolved in hydrochloric acid”.

Self-exiled journalist and producer Mikhail Kozyrev, who interviewed Rubina, decided to take out these bits, calling them “the most complex part” of the interview. Although he appeared to question Rubina on the claim that there are no “peaceful residents in Gaza” by comparing it to the collective blame Russians face over the war in Ukraine, he did not reject her claims and himself took a clear pro-Israel stance throughout his conversation with her.

And while many Russian speakers condemned Rubina – especially in Central Asia where her book talks were cancelled – there were many among Russia’s political emigres who supported her, did not condemn her openly, or maintained her words were taken out of context.

This incident is not an aberration. Many in the Russian liberal opposition, which now operates mostly in exile, unquestioningly support Israel. This is not only due to their tendency to disregard institutionalised racism in Russia but also due to their embrace of a civilisational hierarchy narrative that places the white West at the top. Anti-Palestinian bias is a natural outcome of this worldview.

Examples of the Russian opposition’s virulent anti-Palestinianism abound. Yuliya Latynina, a star columnist living in exile, has made parallels between “barbarians” destroying “blossoming civilisations” and the Palestinians and called students protesting against the genocide in Gaza “lazy and stupid”.

Another self-exiled liberal commentator, Leonid Gozman, has claimed that European countries that voted at the United Nations in favour of a “pro-Hamas” resolution calling for a truce in Gaza did so because they were “afraid of their immigrant communities”.

Andrei Pivovarov, former director of Open Russia, a now-defunct pro-democracy organisation, has said he finds Israel’s actions in Gaza “justified”. He was imprisoned in Russia until he was released last year in a prisoner exchange with the West.

Russian opposition politician, Dmitri Gudkov, currently residing in Bulgaria, has declared: “For me, Israel is the embodiment of civilisation. Anything against it is barbarism.”

Kseniya Larina, a renowned Russian journalist and radio host, also currently in exile, has hosted on her show Israeli Russian-speaking intellectuals multiple times. In one instance, a talk with an Israeli educator was titled, “Recognition of Palestine is not antisemitism, it’s idiocy”.

These are just a few examples of the many Russian liberal emigres who openly supported Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza. In addition, Russian pop icons, comedians, musicians, and TV personalities who are based in Israel or visit also constantly broadcast the Israeli narrative.

Popular Russian oppositional media outlets – the Nobel Prize recipient newsletter Novaya Gazeta, Meduza publication outlet, and TV Rain – disproportionately feature pro-Israeli news with little counter-narrative offered. As a result, racist, anti-Palestinian rhetoric thrives in Russian-language social and traditional media.

The roots of this pro-Israeli stance among Russia’s liberals – who make up the majority of the Russian opposition – go back to the 20th century.

The Jewish people were persecuted by the Tsarist regime during the Russian Empire, which the Bolsheviks initially denounced. But the communist regime itself eventually embraced anti-Semitic views under Joseph Stalin. Discrimination against Jews continued, and it peaked during 1951-53, when Stalin accused a group of Jewish doctors of conspiracy against the state and launched a campaign of persecution. Even after the Communist Party dropped the accusations, Jews continued to be subject to forced assimilation and structural discrimination.

Within this context, the emerging liberal opposition of the 1980s came to perceive Israel as a protector of the victimised Jewish community and a democratic, liberal state, part of the West.

In parallel, there was an immigration wave towards Israel, which was seen as a place of safety for Soviet opposition figures. This also fed into an unconditional allegiance to Israel and Zionism among dissidents, which was inherited by subsequent generations of the liberal opposition.

The pro-Israel bias of the Russian opposition intensified even more after the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, which sent hundreds of thousands of opposition-minded Russians fleeing abroad. Israel has been one of the main destinations; by some estimates, in 2022 alone, some 70,000 Russians moved there, compared with 27,000 in 2021, contributing to a total of about 1.3 million Russian-speakers in Israel.

The paradox here is that the Russian liberal opposition maintains that it is the democratic, moral alternative to President Vladimir Putin’s authoritarianism while openly expressing racist views against the Palestinians. It largely condemns Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and Russian war crimes, but denies the Israeli ones.

In the West, the self-declared democratic values of the Russian opposition are rarely scrutinised. But they should be, because it is not just in relation to Palestine that its racist views are apparent.

In the past, liberal opposition figures have frequently reproduced Kremlin-style narratives about migrants, Muslims, and other racialised people. For example, the late opposition leader Alexey Navalny, once hailed as Russia’s democratic hope, referred to migrants from the Caucasus as “cockroaches” and “flies” in a 2007 video on “How to fight insects”. In 2021, these and other statements led Amnesty International to revoke his prisoner of conscience status; the organisation later apologised and continued to advocate for him until his death in custody.

In April this year, Vladimir Kara-Murza, the vice president of the Free Russia Foundation, claimed that soldiers from Russia’s minorities have an easier time killing Ukrainians than ethnic Russian soldiers do. The statement was seen as an attempt to blame war crimes on racialised minorities and prompted an open letter from the Indigenous of Russia Foundation denouncing it.

These attitudes expressed by Navalny and Kara-Murza are not exceptional. The Russian liberal opposition rarely, if ever, condemns discrimination or racist violence against minorities in Russia. Last year, when activist Rifat Dautov died in custody from apparent torture in the Bashkortostan region, there was almost no reaction from the exiled opposition communities. By contrast, when several weeks later, Navalny died of suspected poisoning in prison, the eulogies and mourning lasted for months.

This reflects a longstanding pattern within Russian liberalism: claiming moral superiority over the Kremlin while sharing the same problematic and prejudiced thinking. The truth is, even if Putin’s regime were to fall tomorrow and this opposition come to power, it is unlikely that it would carry out any major reforms to remove structural racism. The concerns of peripheralised regions that seek greater autonomy within Russia, non-Russian ethnic people, and Indigenous and migrant populations in Russia, do not seem to trouble Russia’s liberal opposition.

It is no wonder the Russian liberal opposition tries to blame Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Putin. It does not want the war to be seen as a direct continuation of Russia’s and the erstwhile USSR’s longstanding expansionist politics and drive to subjugate peoples perceived as lesser.

While in the case of Ukraine, Russian liberals are able to hide behind their opposition to the war, in the case of Palestine, they are exposed.

What Palestinians face today – dehumanisation, dispossession, and denial of existence – mirrors what many racialised and Indigenous people within Russia have long endured. Yet the Russian opposition remains blind to these experiences and continues to see itself as the sole victim of Russian authoritarianism.

"Childhood vaccination rates are sliding in communities across the United States, according to an NBC News data investigation.

How much vaccination percentages have fallen and where exactly have been kept in state health department files — or not tabulated at all. Now this data, covering more than 3,000 counties and other jurisdictions, is in one place.

Doctors say that vaccination rates of 95% or higher are necessary to protect against disease outbreaks. In the 2019-2020 school year, 6 in 10 of the counties and jurisdictions tracking measles-mumps-rubella vaccinations met that threshold. But in the latest data, fewer than 4 in 10 do.

Use this map to see the childhood vaccination rates for the place where you live, and then see how that figure has changed over time. Underneath the map and the chart is data on vaccine exemption percentages — what share of school-age children have legal permission, whether for medical or nonmedical reasons, to not be vaccinated.",literal
"The latest report came hours after the RSF agreed to a three-month humanitarian truce.

Sudan’s paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) fighters are committing war crimes in the Darfur town of el-Fasher, the rights group Amnesty International has alleged in a new report.

The report was published on Tuesday, just hours after the RSF declared that it would immediately enter into a three-month humanitarian truce “in response to international efforts” led by United States President Donald Trump.

Sudan plunged into chaos in April 2023 when a power struggle between the military and the RSF exploded into open fighting in the capital, Khartoum, and elsewhere in the country.

In its latest report, Amnesty said it had collected testimonies from 28 survivors describing atrocities in el-Fasher ranging from the summary execution of unarmed men to the rape of girls and women.

“This persistent, widespread violence against civilians constitutes war crimes and may also constitute other crimes under international law,” Amnesty chief Agnes Callamard said.

“All those responsible must be held accountable for their actions.”

The war in the Darfur region pits the regular forces of General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan against the RSF, headed by his former right-hand man and ally, Mohamed Daglo, since April 2023.

At the end of October, the RSF seized el-Fasher, the last major city in the vast western region of Darfur that had remained outside their control.

Last week, United Nations aid chief Tom Fletcher had said that el-Fasher has been transformed into a “crime scene” and said that those who commit these crimes must “face justice”.

Tuesday’s Amnesty report cites one survivor from el-Fasher who said she and her 14-year-old daughter were raped by RSF fighters as they fled the city.

Her daughter became very ill when they reached the refugee town of Tawila, and died in a clinic there, the woman told the rights group.

Another survivor who fled el-Fasher in late October said he witnessed people being shot by RSF forces while trying to flee.

“The RSF were killing people as if they were flies. It was a massacre. None of the people killed that I have seen were armed soldiers.”

Mediation has so far failed to end the fighting as both sides try to secure military gains before talks are held.

On Sunday, Burhan rejected a US truce proposal from the Quad group of mediators as the “worst yet” and unacceptable. The Quad group comprises the United States, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. Burhan claimed that the presence of the UAE – which he accused of supporting the RSF – in the Quad meant that the proposals could not be seen as unbiased.

The UAE has consistently denied any role in the war in Sudan, and on Monday, it accused Burhan of “consistently obstructive behaviour”.",literal
"'Flesh' wins 2025 Booker Prize: 'We had never read anything quite like it'

toggle caption Yuki Sugiura/Booker Prize Foundation

István isn't one of the most talkative characters in literary fiction. He says ""yeah"" and ""okay"" a lot, and is mostly reactive to the world around him. But that quietness covers up a tumultuous life — from Hungary to England, from poverty to being in close contact with the super-rich.

He's the center of David Szalay's latest novel, Flesh, which just won this year's Booker Prize. ""We had never read anything quite like it,"" said Roddy Doyle, chair of this year's prize, in a statement announcing the win. ""I don't think I've read a novel that uses the white space on the page so well. It's as if the author, David Szalay, is inviting the reader to fill the space, to observe — almost to create — the character with him.""

Szalay is a Hungarian-British author. Flesh is his sixth novel. In 2016, he was shortlisted for the Booker prize for his book All That Man Is. He told the Booker Prize that he was inspired to write Flesh after his own time living between Hungary and England, and noticing the cultural and economic divides that exist within contemporary Europe. ""I also wanted to write about life as a physical experience, about what it's like to be a living body in the world.""

Flesh beat out five other books for the win — including Susan Choi's Flashlight, Kiran Desai's The Loneliness of Sonia and Sunny, Katie Kitamura's Audition, Ben Markovits' The Rest of Our Lives and The Land in Winter by Andrew Miller.

"You know it when you feel it — that burning, achy, uncomfortable feeling on the bottoms of your feet that starts to ruin your run halfway through. I’ve been a runner for over a decade, so I’ve experienced it plenty of times. The culprit? Wearing the wrong sneakers for my arch type.

Up until recently, I wasn’t able to define arch support or tell you what my arch type was. Many runners can’t, which is a problem — arch support is a crucial piece of the puzzle when shopping for sneakers, and it can be the difference between hitting your performance goals or not.

Below, I talked to experts about how to shop for running shoes with arch support, and why arch support is so important. Experts also explained how to figure out your arch type, and shared their favorite running sneakers for flat, high and neutral arches.

What is arch support?

“Arch support refers to the structural components in footwear that help maintain the natural alignment of the foot’s arch,” says Dr. Anne Sharkey, a board-certified podiatrist at North Austin Foot & Ankle Institute in Texas. It prevents excessive pronation (rolling inward) or supination (rolling outward) in the foot, which reduces the risk of pain, fatigue and injuries like plantar fasciitis and shin splints.

Your foot has multiple arches, but when people talk about arch support, they’re referring to the arch in the middle of your foot. It spans the length of your underfoot and you can see it when you look at your feet from the side. There’s three arch types — flat, high and neutral — and each one requires specific types of support from shoes. There’s also variability among arch types in terms of severity and foot structure, so some people need shoes with more prominent support than others — consult a podiatrist if you want personalized recommendations.

How I picked the best running shoes with arch support

Different arch types require different types of support. Below, I broke down what features experts recommend looking for in running sneakers for flat, high and neutral arches. If you don’t know your arch type, learn how to find it here. Also, remember that arch type is only one piece of the puzzle when it comes to shopping for running sneakers — to learn more about what you should look out for, check out our guides to the best women’s and men’s running shoes.

Flat arches : If you have flat arches, your feet tend to overpronate, so you need stability or motion control shoes, says Rebekah Broe , the senior director of product performance for Hoka. (Ed’s note: The inclusion of products sold by Hoka in this article was made independently of Broe.) Stability shoes are best for those with moderately flat feet and motion control shoes are best for more severely flat feet. However, they both help correct misalignment by bringing your feet back into a neutral position. To prevent overpronation and keep the foot aligned, stability and motion control shoes typically have dense, firm foam on the inner side of the midfoot/arch area, a firm heel counter (the stiff part at the back of the shoe) and a wide base, says Sharkey.

High arches : If you have high arches, your feet tend to oversupinate and they don’t absorb shock well, so they need help from extra cushioned shoes that have a somewhat flexible feel, says Broe. A thick layer of foam reduces the impact your body feels every time your feet hit the ground, and it evenly distributes your weight across the shoe to reduce strain, says Sharkey.

A thick layer of foam reduces the impact your body feels every time your feet hit the ground, and it evenly distributes your weight across the shoe to reduce strain, says Sharkey. Neutral arches : If you have neutral arches, your feet pronate and supinate just enough, so your shoes don’t need any specific type of support or correction, says Sharkey. Look for neutral shoes, which keep your feet comfortable and supported rather than impact how they move. These shoes usually have level cushioning, a cushioned sole and a stable base.

Look for neutral shoes, which keep your feet comfortable and supported rather than impact how they move. These shoes usually have level cushioning, a cushioned sole and a stable base. APMA Seal of Acceptance: The American Podiatric Medical Association’s group of podiatrists reviews products like shoes to make sure they promote foot health and meet specific safety and quality standards. If it meets all necessary criteria, a product is given the APMA’s Seal of Acceptance. Experts say APMA-accepted shoes are always a great place to start when shopping since they’re evaluated by a third-party group of doctors.

The running shoes with arch support

To recommend the best running shoes with arch support, I rounded up podiatrists’ and NBC Select staff members’ favorite options. I separated sneakers into three categories — best for flat arches, high arches and neutral arches — and included important information about each one, including weight, material, widths, sizes and heel drop. (Heel drop is the height difference between a shoe’s heel and toe. A higher heel drop means there’s more cushioning in a shoe’s heel than its toe, and a lower heel drop means cushioning is more evenly distributed.)

All the shoes on this list are available in men’s and women’s sizes, and they all come in half and whole sizes. While shopping, you may see brands refer to a shoe’s upper, midsole and outsole. The upper covers the top of your foot, the outsole is the hard material that touches the ground and the midsole connects the upper to the outsole.

Since you won’t know how your feet feel in a pair of sneakers until you try them on, make sure you check a retailer’s return policy before you checkout, says Dr. Priya Parthasarathy, a podiatrist at the Foot & Ankle Specialists of the Mid-Atlantic.

The best running shoes for flat arches

Sharkey says Brooks’ GuideRails System is an effective stabilizing technology, which is exactly what those with flat feet need in a running shoe. It consists of two pieces of foam: a piece on the inside of your heel reduces how much your foot rolls inward, and a piece on the outside of your heel, which is firmer and higher, prevents your foot from shifting outward, according to the brand. These sneakers are made with a medium-thick layer of soft, smooth nitrogen-infused foam, and Brooks says they’re best for road running and walking.

“The Arahi is Hoka’s most supportive sneaker for flat feet,” says Parthasarathy. It’s made with the brand’s H-frame, a firm piece of foam in the midsole (the part of a shoe that connects the upper to the outsole) that’s shaped like the number 8. It runs around the perimeter of the shoe and across the middle to prevent flat feet from overpronating, according to the brand. The Arahi also has a stretchy plush tongue that’s connected to its flat knit upper (the part of a shoe that covers the top of your foot) so it doesn’t move around when you’re running. Its EVA midsole gives it a balanced feel, and its rubber outsole adds grip. Hoka says the sneakers are best for everyday runs and walking.

Hoka’s Gaviota sneaker, which Sharkey recommends, has the same H-frame stabilizing system as the Arahi, but it’s made with a thicker and more plush layer of soft cushioning. The shoe, which is best for everyday runs and walking, is made with a soft, puffy tongue and collar that cradles your ankle. It also has a rocker-shaped outsole that helps you smoothly move through heel-to-toe transitions.

This sneaker is another one of Sharkey’s top picks for runners with flat arches because it’s made with the brand’s Litetruss stabilizing system, which is a lightweight, gel-infused foam that effectively absorbs impact to soften your landings and offers responsive rebound, but it’s not overly cushioned. There’s a soft sockliner on the sneaker’s interior, and it has a padded tongue and collar. The GT-4000 4’s base is wide so your entire foot touches the ground.

The best running shoes for high arches

“The Gel-Nimbus 27s have a ton of cushioning and a ton of comfort in all directions,” says NBC Select reporter Harry Rabinowitz, who has medium-high arches. He likes wearing them for slow runs since they’re “heavy as a boat,” but they keep his feet cozy for miles, so the added weight is worth it. The sneakers’ foam gives them a smooth feel, and they have gel under the heel that absorbs shock and softens your landings, according to the brand. The rubber outsole also has extra grip, which gives you plenty of traction on wet or uneven roads.

If you have high arches but don’t love overly plush sneakers, try the Hoka Cliftons, says Parthasarathy. They’re still highly cushioned, so they effectively absorb shock, but they have firmer EVA foam compared to the Hoka Bondis, giving them a more balanced feel. The shoes’ grippy rubber outsoles have a subtle rocker shape, making your heel-to-toe transitions smooth but not too exaggerated, and reflective details so your feet are visible in low light. Their tongue is also connected to the upper, preventing it from moving around while you’re running. The Clifton 10s are best for everyday runs and walking, according to the brand.

On’s CloudTec cushioning is the most distinct part of the brand’s shoes, and the Cloudmonster has an extra-thick layer of it, which Sharkey recommends for high arches.

The bubbles you see in the midsole compress horizontally and vertically when your feet hit the ground to absorb shock and soften your landings. Then, they expand when you take off to propel you forward. The Cloudmonster is also made with On’s Speedboard, a flexible plastic plate in the midsole that acts as a spring. The shoe’s rocker shape helps you smoothly roll through strides, and it has a soft internal sock liner.

The best running shoes for neutral arches

The Ghost is one of Brooks’ most basic running shoes, and beyond being a reliable daily trainer, I’ve also run 5Ks in them. Rabinowitz is also a fan of these sneakers. “The Ghosts are a go-to recommendation of mine for anyone who wants a comfortable walking or running shoe, but doesn’t know much about sneakers, their feet or their fitness,” he says. “They’re well-balanced for all activities, and have sufficient arch support. Plus, they come in a huge range of sizes and widths.” The sneakers have a medium-thick layer of soft, nitrogen-infused foam, and its midsole works with flexible grooves in the outsole to support your feet through smooth heel-to-toe transitions as you hit the ground and takeoff.

“For most of my recent marathon training, I wore these shoes,” says NBC Select editorial director (and four-time marathoner) Lauren Swanson. “Even with my increased weekly mileage during that training season, I didn’t feel the impact on my knees. If you’ve ever trained for a long distance race, you know how big of a deal that is.” Brooks’ Glycerin sneakers have plush, bouncy, nitrogen-infused foam, and their curved outsole helps you smoothly roll through strides. One of my favorite aspects of this shoe, which I often wear for 10Ks, is its wide base. It makes me feel balanced and stable, especially when going downhill or uphill at a fast pace.

If you’re planning to wear the Glycerins to run long distances, Swanson recommends sizing up. “I lost both of my big toenails during the Chicago Marathon because I was wearing a too-small pair of these,” she says.

I always keep a pair of New Balance Fresh Foams in my closet for 3- to 4-mile recovery runs and long walks. I find them incredibly comfortable thanks to their soft, responsive cushioning, and I appreciate that they have a simple design without any frills like plates or fancy support systems. The Fresh Foams are a basic shoe that I can throw on and practically forget I’m wearing them. They also have a rocker-shaped outsole that makes for seamless heel-to-toe transitions whether I’m running on the road or treadmill.

“I’ve played the field with other sneaker brands, but I keep gravitating toward Saucony’s — it’s something about the lightness and the sole’s spring,” says Swanson. “My favorites are the Saucony Endorphins, but the Guides are a nice, cushiony option for when I need something different.” The shoes, which won an NBC Select Wellness Award, have a broad base, high side walls and foam heel collars that gently hold your feet in place, supporting their natural movement while eliminating excess motion, according to the brand. They have soft foam and a cozy interior sockliner, plus a loop on the back of the heel that helps you pull the shoes onto your feet. The loop is a small yet impactful detail I’m appreciative for.

How to determine your arch type

Visiting a podiatrist is often the best way to determine your arch type, says Parthasarathy, but there are a few methods you can try at home (read about all of them in our guide). The wet footprint test is often the most helpful, says Sharkey. To do it, wet the bottom of one foot, step on a piece of cardboard or colored paper, step off and examine your footprint. Here’s what to look for:

Flat arches : If your whole foot appears in the footprint with little to no curve inward, you have flat or low arches.

: If your whole foot appears in the footprint with little to no curve inward, you have flat or low arches. High arches : If your footprint only shows the heel and ball of your foot with a very narrow or missing section, you have high arches.

: If your footprint only shows the heel and ball of your foot with a very narrow or missing section, you have high arches. Neutral arches: If your footprint has a moderate curve inward with about half of the arch missing from it, you have neutral or medium arches.

Using the wet footprint test, it’s typically easy to identify flat feet, but it can be challenging to distinguish between high and neutral arches, says Parthasarathy. If you try the wet footprint test and are questioning your results, make an appointment with a podiatrist.

Frequently asked questions Why is arch support important? Arch support is important because it ensures that your body stays in alignment while you move, says Broe. If your body isn’t in alignment, like when you overpronate or oversupinate, there’s too much pressure and stress on certain parts of your feet, which can lead to injury. Arch support evenly distributes weight across your feet to reduce fatigue, make you more comfortable, increase energy efficiency and improve your overall performance, especially if you’re doing a high-impact activity like running, says Sharkey. How can you tell if a running shoe has arch support? Not all shoes have built-in arch support. And while you need to look for different features depending on your arch type, there are a few ways you can tell whether a sneaker has arch support in general. First and foremost, avoid anything thin or flat. “You should not be able to bend a shoe completely in half like a sandwich,” says Parthasarathy. That’s because shoes with arch support have a midfoot shank, a strip of material that sits between the midsole and outsole, connecting the ball and heel of your foot. The midfoot shank is usually more rigid in shoes for flat arches and more flexible in shoes for high arches, but regardless, it adds structural support and prevents your feet from twisting, says Sharkey. Also look for a deep heel cup, cushioning in the midsole and a removable insole, says Sharkey. When you remove the insole, you should see a raised area in the shoe’s center, and when you press on it, it should feel firm. If you’re shopping online, prioritize shoes that mention “arch support” on their product pages. Can orthotics add arch support to shoes? Orthotics are inserts you add to your shoes, and they’re tailored to your foot shape and specific support needs, says Sharkey. There are generic options available over-the-counter, but to really be effective, you need to visit a podiatrist who can make you a custom set of orthotics. Orthotics can add arch support to shoes, but they can’t make a bad shoe a good one, says Parthasarathy. “Just adding an orthotic to a shoe doesn’t magically make it more supportive,” she says. “The orthotic needs a good foundation.” Because of this, experts recommend focusing on finding the right shoes for your feet, and if you feel like you need even more support, talk to your podiatrist about orthotics. Does everyone need to wear shoes with arch support? “Arch support isn’t a universal need by any means,” says Broe. Those with flat feet, a history of foot pain and previous injuries benefit most from arch support, but many people find that it makes shoes more comfortable, helps prevent injuries and improves how they move, says Sharkey. Whether you need arch support depends on factors like your foot structure, how your feet feel while you do specific activities and underlying foot conditions, so consult your podiatrist if you’re thinking about it. How can you tell if you’re wearing the wrong shoes for your arches? If your feet are uncomfortable or you’re experiencing pain while wearing a pair of shoes, they’re likely not the best option for your arches. “Make sure your sneakers are comfortable right away,” says Parthasarathy. “Some people wait for the shoes to “give” or “work in” to be more comfortable, but if they’re not comfortable when you receive them, they aren’t going to get anymore comfortable, especially as your feet swell the longer you wear them.” That said, it can take time to get used to the feeling of arch support in your sneakers, so try wearing them for two hours a day before your first run in them. But your feet shouldn’t feel overly uncomfortable right away, says Parthasarathy. Other signs that your sneakers aren’t properly supporting your arches include heel slippage, a burning sensation on the bottoms of your feet while running, arch fatigue and arch soreness, says Sharkey. Are stability shoes and arch support shoes the same thing? No, stability shoes and arch support shoes are not the same thing. Stability shoes are specifically designed to correct overpronation associated with flat arches, while arch support shoes can be designed for flat, high or neutral arches, says Sharkey. Overall, all stability shoes have arch support, but not all shoes with arch support are stability shoes. How often should you replace your running shoes? You should replace your running shoes every 300 to 500 miles, or when they feel worn out. “Don’t wear your running shoes until there are holes in them,” says Parthasarathy. “Sometimes your shoes don’t even look worn, but suddenly, you can bend them completely in half. That’s a sign you should change them.”

"Absolutely nothing about this set feels predictable: at 81, Mulatu Astatke is still pushing the boundaries of genre. Even on his farewell tour, there is no easing in, either. The father of Ethio-jazz and his band immediately play Tsome Diguwa as if conjuring a thunderstorm, which in turn crashes straight into Zèlèsègna Dèwèl, a piece written in the 4th-century Ethiopian tradition, its harmonic minor tonality sounding almost Arabic.

Astatke has a serious demeanour. Unsentimental, he speaks only to introduce songs or instruct the band like a schoolteacher. But he views his vibraphone with care and bewilderment, playing with intense familiarity yet almost as though discovering it for the first time. His fascination with his instrument holds the audience captive in turn. During Yèkèrmo Sèw – which fittingly translates to “a man of experience and wisdom” – Astatke’s solo fills the room, water-like in its shapeshifting.

The set is equally a showcase for his band. That song, as well as Nètsanèt, highlight their instrumental range and individual capabilities, with solos from James Arben (saxophone), Byron Wallen (trumpet), Danny Keane (plucking cello) and Alexander Hawkins (grand piano). For Kulun, an Ethiopian wedding song, two Ethiopian musicians join the ensemble, playing a masinko (a single-stringed, bowed, lute-like instrument) and a krar (a five-stringed, plucked lyre), and two dancers in traditional outfits also enter to the delight of the crowd. For Azmari and Chik Chikka, technical and highly experimental solos from Keane and John Edwards (double bass) are interspersed with dance breaks.

View image in fullscreen Photograph: Sonja Horsman/The Guardian

It’s a set rich in sensation. Edwards rubs the double bass body creating a cat-like screech, or drags the bow in an exact replica of a yawn. Richard Baker provides West African percussion astride conga drums, Saworo bells (a selection of traditional hunter’s bells and beer bottle tops), metal bells (Adodo, Apitua, Aja Orisa) and dùndún “talking” drum, creating rich texture throughout. For Yègellé Tezeta, he also sings in Yoruba in call-and-response with Edwards’ conversational bass. Astatke introduces the penultimate song, Mulatu, as “a piece I composed for myself”: it sounds like a wandering train of thought with glittering bells and mystical keyboard.

There’s a rousing encore in Yèkatit. Where you might expect its crescendo to be resolved in a crash of drums, instead, Astatke guides drummer Ben Brown in a muted, controlled whisper of cymbals. It’s true to the reputation Astatke has built over his five-decade career: a whirlwind of experimentation and excitement, but always with deliberation and control.

"A Maryland family is trying to get their loved one back after she was deported from the U.S. to a country they say she had no ties to. Video that’s made international news showed her being dragged by people her family believes worked for Ghana’s government.

The videos obtained by the NBC Washington I-Team are raising questions from her family about how people are treated after they are deported from the U.S. to countries other than their countries of origin.

As part of the Trump administration’s third-country deportation program, dozens of deportees have been sent from the U.S. to Africa since this summer, NBC News reported.

Rabbiatu Kuyateh, a 58-year-old mother and grandmother, moved to the D.C. area 30 years ago as she fled Sierra Leone’s civil war, said Mohamed Alghali, her son. He owns a home in Bowie with his mom, who he called his best friend.

“I felt defeated. Felt like I failed my mom,” he said.

Alghali was born in the U.S. and his family put down roots in the D.C. area. His grandparents joined them and became citizens. Kuyateh’s attorney says she was a nurse with a work permit but never became a citizen.

‘My heart just broke’

Alghali was required to check in every year with U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement.

Her check-in this July was different.

“They called her to the back. They said, ‘Yeah, Rabbiatu, you have a order of removal. So, we’re, you know, yeah, we’re detaining you,” her son said.

“I mean, my heart just broke,” he said.

Alghali was optimistic he would see his mother again. But he wouldn’t see her face-to-face. After several days at Maryland ICE’s temporary holding area, she was moved to an ICE facility in Louisiana, where she was held for months, her attorney said.

“I don’t think anyone expected her to be detained, just because nothing had changed with her circumstances,” attorney Hannah Bridges said.

Kuyateh’s attorney said Kuyateh was still in Louisiana in September when a judge granted an order saying she could not be sent back to Sierra Leone, where she said her client had been tortured.

Bridges said the U.S. immediately began exploring other countries to send her to, which the attorney tried to fight in court with requests for hearings.

“Those requests went unacknowledged,” Bridges said.

Kuyateh’s civil rights have been violated, her attorney said.

“She should have been given notice and an opportunity to seek protection from removal to a third country, and the government had multiple opportunities to do this,” Bridges said.

Rabbiatu Kuyateh says she was flown to Ghana in shackles

Earlier this month, Kuyateh was flown from the U.S. to Ghana, a country she said she had never been to.

Alghali called his mother while the I-Team was with him. She said as she was flown from the U.S. to Ghana, her wrists and ankles were shackled for the entire 10-hour flight. Some had it even worse, she said.

“There was another guy on the floor. That guy, they chained from the head. Down to the feet,” Kuyateh said. “They said if you don’t cooperate with us, that’s how we’re going to tie you.”

Kuyateh told the I-Team she and other deportees were sent to a hotel in Ghana. She said she was there for six days before video captured her being dragged.

A bus arrived to take Kuyateh to Sierra Leone — though a U.S. judge had ordered that she could not be sent there. She told News4 she resisted.

“That’s when they dragged me. So, they bumped the back of my head,” Kuyateh said.

The I-Team obtained multiple videos of the dragging, which were sent to her family and provided to News4.

Kuyateh said she believes the people on video in green uniforms worked for Ghana’s government.

Photos show some of the injuries Kuyateh said she sustained from being dragged.

The video went viral overseas, and several media outlets in West Africa reported that the Sierra Leone High Commission, which is like its embassy in Ghana, said it’s aware of what happened and will investigate.

NBC Washington asked the Ministry of the Interior for Ghana about this. They acknowledged our email but did not answer our questions. We received no response from Sierra Leone officials.

‘I consider America my home’

Kuyateh said she’s safe for now in an undisclosed location in Sierra Leone. But she wants to be with her family.

“I consider America my home. It’s like, I built relationships there,” she said.

In the home she owns in Bowie, her family asked what her future would hold and if she would ever return. The I-Team asked her son if she felt that the U.S. had failed his mom.

“Yes, one hundred percent. I felt like they’ve been failing her,” Alghali said.

The I-Team reached out to ICE in Maryland for comment several days ago. They asked that we share our videos of Kuyateh being dragged, which we did. They still have not responded to our questions about her case.

In September, the U.S. Department of Justice argued in federal court that it had no power to control how another country treats deportees. It said that Ghana had pledged to the U.S. that it wouldn’t send deportees back to their home countries.

The United Nations human rights office has called on Ghana to stop deporting people from the U.S. to their home countries if U.S. courts have said it’s dangerous for them to return.

Kuyateh was the primary caregiver for her mother and father. She told the I-Team she’s worried about who will take care of them now. When she was detained in the U.S., she thought she was being released to head back to Maryland when she was forced to board the flight to Ghana.

"Opinion: Pope Leo's hope-inspiring favorite films

toggle caption Dan Kitwood/Getty Images

Imagine this on a movie poster: ""'Two thumbs up! — Pope Leo.""

The pope meets movie stars and directors at the Vatican today, including Cate Blanchett, Chris Pine, Spike Lee, Viggo Mortensen, and Monica Bellucci, to ""deepen dialogue with the World of Cinema,"" says the Vatican. Pope Leo also revealed his four favorite movies.

One is 1965's The Sound of Music with Julie Andrews. Great songs, great curtains, ""wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings …"" And nuns who sneak under the hood of the Gestapo's cars to remove critical parts, so the Trapp family can flee Nazi rule in Austria, climbing every mountain as they go.

Another is Frank Capra's 1946 film, It's A Wonderful Life. George Bailey, played by Jimmy Stewart, questions the worth of his life while standing on a snowy bridge. But Clarence, an angel, shows him how so many lives would be poorer without him. ""Strange, isn't it?"" asks Clarence. ""Each man's life touches so many other lives. When he isn't around, he leaves an awful hole, doesn't he?""

The pope also lists 1980's Ordinary People, directed by Robert Redford, about the struggles of a family in which one son has died in an accident, and the surviving son has tried to end his life. A psychiatrist, played by Judd Hirsch, tells him, ""Feelings are scary. And sometimes they're painful. And if you can't feel pain, then you're not going to feel anything else either.""

And finally, Pope Leo cites the 1997 film, Life is Beautiful. Roberto Benigni plays Guido, a Jewish Italian bookshop owner, sent to a concentration camp with his son. Guido dances and mugs to try to convince the little boy it's all a game, hoping to protect him from knowing the savagery that surrounds them. The film was honored and popular, but also criticized for trying to strike laughs from a concentration camp. Benigni, who's father had been in a Nazi labor camp, told The Guardian, ""To laugh and to cry comes from the same point of the soul, no?""

The pope's favorite flick list offers nothing avant-garde, for critics. But the movies he loves are also not all ""raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens."" They're popular films that show glimpses of darkness, depression, and grave historical events. But as great art can, they still let in slivers of inspiration and light.",figurative
"Donald Glover, who performs under the name Childish Gambino, has revealed he had a stroke last year which forced him to cancel world tour dates.

At the time the 42-year-old said he was dealing with an “ailment” after performing in New Orleans and had gone to a hospital in Houston, where he discovered he needed surgery. He subsequently postponed, then entirely cancelled the remainder of his US tour, as well as all of his UK, European and Australian dates, writing: “Unfortunately, my path to recovery is taking longer than expected.”

While performing at Tyler, the Creator’s Camp Flog Gnaw festival in Los Angeles on Saturday night, Glover told the audience that he’d had a stroke.

“I was doing this world tour,” he said. “I was having lots of fun, really loving seeing you guys out there.

“I had a really bad pain in my head in Louisiana and I did the show anyway. I couldn’t really see well, so when we went to Houston, I went to the hospital and the doctor was like, ‘You had a stroke.’

“And the first thing I thought was like, ‘Oh, here I am still copying Jamie Foxx,’” he joked, referring to Foxx’s stroke in 2023. “That’s really like the second thing. The first thing was like, ‘I’m letting everybody down.’ I know it’s not true.”

Glover also revealed that he had broken one of his feet, then doctors found a hole in his heart, which required him to undergo surgery twice.

“They say everybody has two lives and the second life starts when you realise you have one,” Glover said. “You got one life, guys, and I gotta be honest, the life I’ve lived with you guys has been such a blessing.”

Glover, who has won five Grammy awards, has retired his Childish Gambino stage name after releasing his final album, Bando Stone & the New World. The tour was to be his farewell to Childish Gambino.",literal
"For the last two months, US forces have amassed outside Venezuela and carried out a series of lethal strikes on civilian boats. The Trump White House has ordered these actions in the name of fighting “narco-terrorists” – a label apparently applicable to anyone suspected of participating in drug trafficking near Latin American coastlines. More than 80 people have already been killed in these pre-emptive strikes, and war hawks are calling for expanded military action to depose the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro.

Watching this play out, I am reminded of a passage from the geographer Stuart Elden’s award-winning 2009 book, Terror and Territory. In discussing how to study the “war on terror”, Elden observed that it did not make sense to study terrorism as something unique to non-state actors.

“States clearly operate in ways that terrify,” Elden said. “The terrorism of non-state actors is a very small proportion of terrorism taken as a whole, with states having killed far more than those who oppose them.”

A large body of research supports this claim.

Researchers with Brown University’s Costs of War project, for example, have found that US-led interventions in the “war on terror” from 2001 to 2023 killed over 400,000 civilians in direct war violence. They also show evidence that when considering indirect deaths – for example, people in war zones dying from treatable medical conditions after clean water or medical infrastructure was destroyed – death toll estimates rise to at least 3.5m. Moreover, even beyond direct war zones, a recent study in the Lancet found that sanctions during the same period were also extremely deadly, causing as many as 500,000 excess deaths per year from 2010 to 2021.

We have already spent decades terrorizing civilian populations around the world in the name of fighting terror

In short, we have already spent decades terrorizing civilian populations around the world in the name of fighting terror. This is well known, and yet the Trump White House is reinvigorating the “war on terror” anyway. Still more, it is trying to do it with even less oversight on the president’s license to kill than has been exercised in the past.

While on the surface Trump’s second term has been characterized by a disorienting barrage of executive orders and culture war polemics, the administration has in fact been running a cohesive authoritarian playbook aimed at conferring near limitless powers to the presidency. These concerted efforts have played out in numerous policy arenas from immigration, to higher education, to economics, to even determining who is a citizen.

Consistent with this pattern, Trump is asserting the same unchecked authority over the violent capacities of the US military.

As I have written previously, a key tactic of the Trump White House has been eviscerating the oversight of the courts, making it impossible to impede the executive branch from continuing to break the law, even when it gets caught red-handed. However, another frequent strategy – perhaps less visible, though equally anathema to a system of limited government – has been to simply sidestep oversight by asserting that, even when law in theory places limits on presidential power, the exercise of this power is still “unquestioned”; according to this thinking, the executive branch apparently has the prerogative to interpret what those limits are.

Of course, in a serious constitutional system, this would be preposterous. In practice, there would be no limits to presidential powers, rendering the constitution moot. Nonetheless, this is exactly the type of power that Trump is asserting over the military, both at home and abroad.

The court case related to Trump’s efforts to suppress protests in Chicago using troops sheds critical light on how this strategy works. Federal law allows a president to deploy troops domestically if there is a “rebellion” that is making it impossible to “execute the laws of the United States”. Accordingly, some lower court judges have reasonably blocked the deployment of troops, finding that the administration has been unable to prove that these conditions were met. Just look at the facts: protests had on average only been about 50 people at a time, and they have clearly not made law enforcement impossible since ICE – the federal agency being protested – has vastly increased arrests during this time.

True to form, however, Trump’s lawyers have argued that these details are irrelevant. In their view, there is actually no need to prove a rebellion is happening because the president has the authority to define rebellion anyway. In other words, the law might impose limits on how the president can use the military, but the president gets to decide what those limits are.

While lower courts have so far prevented this nakedly authoritarian legal theory from taking hold, the argument itself is still massively consequential: first, because an extremely Trump-friendly supreme court will hear the case soon and could very well endorse these claims; and second, because this is essentially the same logic that the Trump administration has used to justify killing civilians off the Latin American coast. Indeed, just as the Trump administration is asserting the exclusive right to define “rebellion” regardless of the facts on the ground – thus eliminating any real limits on the power to deploy troops domestically – the Trump White House is similarly asserting the unencumbered right to define “terrorist”, along with the corresponding right to take deadly action with virtually no outside oversight.

In public statements, Trump has defended treating drug smugglers as terrorists by citing the harm done by drug overdoses, in effect suggesting that drug traffickers are directly killing US citizens. Ignoring the fact that Venezuela doesn’t produce fentanyl, the main driver of overdoses in the US, Trump has even gone so far as to float the mathematically impossible claim that each boat strike has saved 25,000 lives. Of course, officials have provided zero public evidence that the boats attacked were carrying drugs at all, much less tried to explain how blowing up boats would have any impact at all on drug abuse in the US.

But again, why would they? The whole point of the argument is that such facts don’t matter because Trump simply has the unchecked authority to use lethal force. In fact, the justice department has suggested that officials do not even have to publicly list which foreign organizations are classified as killable terrorists, much less provide evidence to support this designation.

Ultimately, Trump’s actions in and around Venezuela are best understood as a new phase in the “war on terror” – an ongoing tragedy that has already had deadly consequences for millions – though now with even fewer guardrails. The bottom line: Venezuela is not just some chess piece in an abstract game of geopolitics, and we are doing a disservice to humanity if we let war hawks in government and media spin it this way. We are talking about real people, and as very recent history shows, countless lives are at stake.",literal
"It should come as no surprise that the new album by Oneohtrix Point Never comes with a concept attached. They usually do. When not composing film soundtracks, or producing an eclectic range of other artists – the Weeknd, Anohni, Charli xcx, Soccer Mommy – Daniel Lopatin has released a string of acclaimed works, each with their own overarching idea.

The “hyperreal world music” of 2010’s Returnal was inspired by the fact that people now see more of the world than ever without actually leaving their homes. In 2015, Garden of Delete had an accompanying origin story about an adolescent humanoid alien called Ezra; 2018’s Age Of imagined artificial intelligence attempting to recreate human culture after humans themselves had been rendered extinct. Lopatin also has an all-consuming obsession with nostalgia and forgotten pop cultural artefacts: he’s made albums based around warped loops of 80s pop hits, preset sounds on obsolete synthesisers and recordings of US radio stations changing formats, discarding the musical genres in which they previously specialised in favour of the current vogue.

View image in fullscreen The artwork for Tranquilizer. Photograph: Warp Records

All of which makes Tranquilizer very much in the Oneohtrix Point Never wheelhouse. It feels not unlike a sequel to Replica, released 14 years ago. On that album, Lopatin drew on sounds from a collection of bootleg DVDs he bought online compiling old TV adverts from the 80s and 90s. Tranquilizer is constructed from a cache of old sample CDs – pre-packaged collections of royalty-free sounds that used to be sold to musicians and producers in the 90s and early 00s – that Lopatin found uploaded to the Internet Archive. An extra frisson came when, after bookmarking the page for future use, he discovered that it had been deleted. It subsequently reappeared, but it underlined the shakiness of the assumption that everything is preserved for ever in some corner of cyberspace.

There was something disorienting about the music on Replica, not least its use of minute snatches of spoken word: you’d hear the intake of breath and the first syllable of a voiceover, but the rest of the sentence would never appear, just a tiny fragment of its opening, looping or juddering. There’s something similarly unsettled about Tranquilizer. Sample CDs were frequently compiled along genre lines, labelled for use in drum’n’bass, or hip-hop, or house: from the start, the sounds on Tranquilizer strongly suggest that the CDs Lopatin downloaded were intended for those making ambient or new age music. For Residue opens with the sound of the ocean, some big, Pink Floyd-y guitar chords, wordless breathy vocals and thick, warm electronic tones. Elsewhere, you hear such obvious 90s ambient signifiers as tinkling windchime-like tones, Satie-esque piano figures, slow-paced non-specific “tribal” drums, the crackle of old vinyl and snatches of muted trumpet that recall the sound of late Brian Eno collaborator Jon Hassell. The synthesisers at the end of Modern Lust, meanwhile, are a dead ringer for those used on the KLF’s landmark album Chill Out.

Oneohtrix Point Never: Dis – video

Despite its title, Tranquilizer never feels particularly recumbent. Rather, it lulls the listener into a false sense of security with the familiarity of its sounds, then throws you for a loop. Sometimes the effect is straightforwardly unsettling, as when the patterns of the sounds on Bumpy run jarringly out of time, like a stuck record, or abruptly switch and change on Vestigel; or bend in pitch, lending a sickly, lightheaded air to Lifeworld. Sometimes the effect is overwhelming and euphoric: the shift during Rodl Glide, where a slow ooze of sound is dramatically replaced by full-on rave dynamics, or the sudden eruption of chattering synths midway through Dis. (In a startlingly Proustian period detail for listeners of a certain age, the track is also disrupted by the sound of speaker interference caused by an old 2G mobile phone.) Over five and half minutes, closer Waterfalls moves from windswept empty landscapes to busy urban propulsion, from passages that sound like the Japanese new age music collected on Visible Cloaks’ celebrated 2010 mix series Fairlights, Mallets and Bamboo to a burst of something that resembles an early 80s kids TV theme: the effect is heady and exhausting rather than relaxing.

For all the calm its source material was ostensibly intended to provoke, the record spends an hour in constant, agitated motion: chillout music transposed into an era where it’s increasingly difficult to chill out, where the constant bombardment of content and the dopamine hit of doomscrolling has made relaxing something we have to work at. Tranquilizer seems unlikely to help you calm down. It’s too kaleidoscopic and restless, too crammed with sounds: an album that demands – and repays – your full attention, rather than simply drifting by.

The S&P 500 ended the day higher by 1.6%. The Nasdaq Composite wrapped the trading day up 2.7%, its best day since May. The S&P 500 came within striking distance of achieving the same feat earlier in the session.

The rally came after two top Fed officials voiced support for an interest rate cut at the central bank's next rate-setting meetings, slated for Dec. 9 and 10.

Mary Daly, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, told The Wall Street Journal that she supported lowering rates due to the ""vulnerable"" labor market. While Daly is not a current voting member of the Fed's Open Market Committee,"" she has rarely taken a public position at odds with Fed Chair Jerome Powell,"" the Journal noted.

Federal Reserve Governor Christoper Waller, who has a permanent vote on interest rates, also voiced concern about the labor market on Fox Business Network.

""My concern is mainly [the] labor market in terms of our dual mandate,"" Waller said. ""So I’m advocating for a rate cut at the next meeting.""

While Waller has been advocating for a cut for months, his and Daly's views come as markets try to work out how the upcoming Fed meeting will go. In recent days, markets viewed a rate cut as unlikely amid a wave of cautious comments from Fed officials.

That all changed on Friday, when New York Fed President John Williams signaled his support for a cut and sent the chance of a rate cut soaring to around 60%. Williams also serves as vice chair of the Fed's rate-setting committee.

As of Monday afternoon, odds of a cut sat above 85%, according to the CME Group's FedWatch, which tracks bets that traders place in the futures market on where they see interest rates going.

Markets are closely tracking Fed officials because lower interest rates tend to lower borrowing costs, boosting corporate profits and therefore stock market returns.

Meanwhile, a sharp rebound in megacap tech stocks also pushed indexes higher. Apple and Nvidia rose around 2%, Amazon shares jumped 2.5% and Alphabet shares surged 6.3%.

Last week, Alphabet's Google division announced a new AI model called Gemini 3.

Chipmakers for AI devices and services also saw broad enthusiasm. Broadcom traded higher by more than 11% while Micron jumped 8% and AMD popped 5.5%.",figurative
"Israel‘s military chief on Sunday dismissed several senior military personnel and reprimanded others over their roles in the failures on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas launched a surprise attack on southern Israel from Gaza.

A number of officers were told they would be released from reserve duty and would no longer serve in the military, the military said in a statement. Others were issued formal reprimands while one was informed that their service would be ended. Another tendered his resignation.

Those informed that they would be released from reserve duty included the former heads of intelligence directorate, operations directorate, and southern command, which is responsible for Gaza. The generals had previously resigned from active service but remained on reserve duty.

“The IDF failed in its primary mission on October 7th — to protect the civilians of the State of Israel,” Israeli military chief of staff Eyal Zamir said, referring to the Israel Defense Forces.

“This is a severe, resounding, systemic failure, relating to decisions and conduct on the eve of the event and during it. The lessons of that day are numerous and significant, and they must serve as our compass for the future toward which I intend to lead the IDF.”

The latest disciplinary steps come as Israeli officials face mounting public pressure over accountability for the failures that led to the attack.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government has not yet opened a national inquiry into the Oct. 7 attack. Thousands of protesters were joined by opposition leaders in Tel Aviv on Saturday night demanding a state commission of inquiry.

The assault by Hamas and other Palestinian factions killed around 1,200 people in Israel and saw some 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies.

The attack triggered Israel‘s ground and air campaign in Gaza, which has devastated large parts of the enclave and killed more than 69,000 people, according to local health authorities.

Israel and Hamas reached a U.S.-brokered ceasefire agreement last month, as part of the first phase of a plan to end the war.",literal
"New York Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani said Saturday that he still believes President Donald Trump is a “fascist” and a “despot,” but he viewed their first face-to-face meeting at the White House on Friday as an “opportunity” to work together on lowering the cost of living for New Yorkers.

After months of trading insults during the campaign, the two were friendly during the meeting, with the president telling reporters he’ll be “cheering” for Mamdani, and the mayor-elect calling the meeting “productive.”

Following their meeting, Mamdani was asked by reporters if he stood by his decision to call Trump a “fascist” during his campaign.

“That’s OK, you can just say it,” Trump told him, jokingly. “It’s easier, it’s easier than explaining it.”

On Saturday, Mamdani told “Meet the Press” moderator Kristen Welker that he does still believe the president is a fascist.

“After President Trump said that, I said, ‘Yes,’” Mamdani said.

He added, “That’s something I’ve said in the past and I say today. And I think what I appreciated about the conversation that I had with the president was that we were not shy about the places of disagreement, about the politics that has brought us to this moment, and we also wanted to focus on what it could look like to deliver on a shared analysis of an affordability crisis for New Yorkers.”

Mamdani referred to other past negative comments about Trump, telling Welker, “Everything that I’ve said in the past, I continue to believe.”

“I’m not coming into the Oval Office to make a point or make a stand. I’m coming in there to deliver for New Yorkers,” he added.

The mayor-elect also spoke about his attitude going into the meeting and why it ended up so friendly.

“I thought again and again about what it would mean for New Yorkers if we could establish a productive relationship that would focus on the issues that those New Yorkers stay up late at night thinking about,” rather than keep trading barbs, Mamdani told Welker.

“When you actually ask New Yorkers and you listen to them, you hear it come back to the issues that animated not just the conversation the president and I had with the press after our meeting, but frankly, in the meeting itself,” Mamdani added.

The mayor-elected pointed to Trump’s own campaign message last year, which included promises to lower costs for Americans on Day 1 of his second term.

On Saturday, Mamdani said he went out of his way during the mayoral campaign to speak to New Yorkers living in the Bronx and Queens who had voted for Trump in 2024.

“I shared with the president that when I asked those New Yorkers why did they vote for the president, they told me again and again, it was cost of living, cost of living, cost of living,” the mayor-elect said. “And when the president and I were speaking, we were speaking about what is preventing from delivering on that affordability agenda.”

In the weeks leading up to Election Day, Trump frequently bashed Mamdani online, calling him a “communist lunatic” and threatening to cut off federal funding for New York City if voters elected Mamdani, who refers to himself as a democratic socialist. Mamdani often shot back, once calling Trump a “despot.”

On Friday, after reporters asked the pair about that particular insult, the president said, “I’ve been called much worse than a despot,” adding, “I think he’ll change his mind after we get to working together.”

On the eve of the election, Trump even endorsed Mamdani’s strongest opponent, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat-turned-independent who ran in the general election after losing to Mamdani in the Democratic primary.

In his victory speech, Mamdani spoke forcefully against the Trump administration, promising that “New York will be the light” in political darkness and telling Trump to “turn the volume up.”

On Sunday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett spoke about the Trump-Mamdani meeting, saying that Trump plans to work with the new mayor on affordability but that “none of those [policies] really jump off the page for me as really strong ideas.”

Still, Hassett added, ""I think that if Mamdani cares as much as he appears to for the people of New York, President Trump obviously does, I think that there’s a lot of positive work that can be done together.""

Mamdani said Saturday that he and the president also spoke about Trump’s threats to send National Guard troops into New York City, as he’s done in several other major Democratic-led cities in recent months.

Mamdani didn’t answer questions about whether Trump ruled out the possibility of sending troops to New York City, but said, “What I told him is that what separates New York City from anywhere else in the country is we have the NYPD, and I trust the NYPD to deliver public safety, and to me, that is something that I know that they can do, that they have done, and they will continue to do under my leadership.”

Asked at the White House on Saturday whether he planned to send troops to New York City, Trump said simply, “If they need it.”

“Right now, other places need it more, but if they need — we had a very good meeting yesterday. We talked about that, but if they need it, I would do it,” Trump told reporters.

On Sunday, Hassett also addressed Trump's threats during the campaign to withhold federal funds from New York City if Mamdani was elected.

""Well, it feels like he doesn’t mean it now, and I guess it — we’ll have to wait and see what Mamdani does,"" Hassett said.

One of Mamdani’s key campaign promises was to raise taxes on the city’s highest earners to fund key policy objectives. To do so, he’ll need the blessing of Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul and state legislators in Albany.

The mayor-elect didn’t answer questions about whether Hochul has committed to helping him raise taxes, but said the two are both committed to making New York City more affordable.

“I think she’ll work with me to deliver on affordability. I think raising taxes make the most sense,” Mamdani said. “If there’s any alternatives that raise the same amount of money, I’m open.”

On Saturday, Mamdani also spoke about his relationship with the nation’s Democratic leaders.

In the months leading up to the election, many were hesitant to endorse the self-described democratic socialist. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., never endorsed Mamdani, and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., only did so less than two weeks before Election Day.

Still, Mamdani last week urged members of New York’s Democratic Socialists of America chapter not to endorse a primary challenger to Jeffries.

And on Saturday, Mamdani told “Meet the Press” that he supports Jeffries becoming the speaker of the House if Democrats retake the majority in the 2026 midterm elections.

Mamdani also spoke about his conversation with former President Barack Obama after his victory, saying the two spoke about “the importance of what it looks like, not only to inspire hope, but to sustain it, and then to deliver on it.”",literal
"Millions of Palestinians remain crammed into overcrowded tents, packed schools and other buildings, or sleeping on the streets of Gaza, as Israel continues its genocidal war on the enclave despite a fragile ceasefire.

Overcrowding, poor sanitation, a lack of food and a shortage of medicine have turned Gaza’s makeshift shelters into a breeding ground for infectious diseases.

“Even the minimum standards of human dignity and hygiene cannot be maintained under these conditions,” Samaher Saeed, Medical Aid for Palestine’s (MAP) protection manager in Gaza, tells Al Jazeera from southern Gaza.

“There's no stability, no safety,” Saeed adds, capturing the daily reality faced by displaced Palestinians.

What is life like inside a Gaza tent?

To understand just what living conditions are like in a tent in Gaza, Al Jazeera visited a camp in Deir el-Balah, the governorate with the highest number of active shelters.

The living space is divided into outdoor and indoor areas. The outdoor section serves multiple daily needs, including cooking meals over an open fire, washing dishes, hanging clothes and using the outdoor toilet, while the indoor area is primarily for sleeping and shelter from the sun or rain.

The tent’s shaded area measures 20 sqm (215sq ft) and is shared by an average of 10 people, giving each just 2sqm (22sq ft) of personal space, well below the UNHCR’s recommended minimum of 3.5sqm per person and 2 metres (6.5ft) height for proper ventilation.

The tent itself is built from old blankets and fabric scraps, with sheets of nylon held up with ropes and supported by metal and wooden poles. These materials offer minimal protection from rain, do little to ensure privacy, and fail to regulate temperatures during cold winters and hot summers.

“The tents that were set up early in the war have completely deteriorated after two years of use; they no longer protect people from shrapnel, the summer heat or the winter cold,” says Saeed.

Earlier reporting by Al Jazeera in Gaza describes a mother speaking of “a summer that has ravaged children’s bodies” and being “eaten by flies and insects” where the “tent environment is very miserable”.

In the corners of the tent, personal belongings are stored in sacks and cardboard boxes, while clothes are hung up to maximise space, allowing them to be quickly packed in the face of Israel’s constant forced expulsion orders and incessant bombings.

Kitchen space

Kitchen utensils, pots and pans are tucked away in another corner of the outdoor living space, while plastic containers store precious drinking water.

Just outside, an open fire is used for cooking, but it sits next to piles of rubbish, including cardboard and other materials to be used as fuel, releasing harmful smoke into the air and creating health risks.

Hundreds of thousands of tonnes of rubbish have built up near camps.

Israel has restricted access to Gaza's two main landfills, at Juhor ad-Dik in the north and al-Fukhari (also known as Sofa) in the south, where this rubbish would normally be taken.

As of February 2025, the continued denial of access to the Sofa landfill, located in the no-go zone, is preventing the transfer of solid waste from the 30 temporary dump sites and numerous persistent ad hoc sites.

“We often find ourselves in situations where we know that people are living in dangerous or undignified environments near sewage, waste dumps or unsafe shelters, but we simply have no alternative to offer them,” Saeed says.

Sleeping area

Sleeping arrangements are rough; the best people can hope for is to find a thin foam mattress to sleep on, but there isn't one for each family member, and many end up sleeping on the ground. Blankets and pillows are stowed away during the day.

Toilet facilities

With few functioning toilets, people are forced to dig latrines or use buckets. According to MAP, on average, up to 600 people are forced to share a single latrine, 30 times more than the minimum standards.

Sewage and human waste flow into streets and near shelters as a result.

Lack of sanitation and hygiene

Access to basic sanitation and hygiene remains severely limited in Gaza, particularly for women.

Wafaa Nasrallah, a displaced mother of two, cannot afford to buy sanitary pads and has tried using rags and even nappies.

She is one of many women who cannot access hygiene items, and some have resorted to taking medication to stop their menstrual cycles entirely.

Menstruating women and girls also do not have access to enough water to wash or privacy in bathroom facilities to enable them to do so, even if they find the water.

“Girls are sleeping on bare ground during their periods due to the lack of clean bedding or private space,” says Saeed.

Israel has rendered more than 85 percent of Gaza’s water and sanitation infrastructure inoperable, from wells to treatment facilities.

Disease spreading

Preventable diseases are spreading in the camps due to overcrowding, the lack of clean facilities and a lack of medication.

According to a Journal of Medicine, Surgery, and Public Health paper published in April, Gaza currently faces an enormous infectious disease caseload, with 700,000 officially reported cases.

Contaminated water sources will “propagate waterborne illnesses such as cholera and dysentery, exacerbating the public health crisis”, where poverty, overcrowding, inadequate hygiene, contaminated food and a lack of safe drinking water all serve as significant risk factors for cholera.",literal
"Israeli forces have killed at least four Palestinians and wounded several others across Gaza despite a six-week ceasefire, as a Palestinian armed group announced recovering the body of another captive in the war-torn territory.

The victims on Monday included a Palestinian man who was killed in a drone attack in the southern town of Bani Suheila, in an area controlled by Israeli forces beyond the so-called “yellow line”.

Separately, a Palestinian child was also killed in northern Gaza City when ordnances left behind by Israeli forces exploded, according to the territory’s civil defence.

The group said several more children were wounded, with some in critical condition.

Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum, reporting from Gaza City, said Israeli attacks also continued throughout the day, with artillery, air raids and helicopter strikes reported in both northern and southern parts of the enclave.

In Beit Lahiya, Israeli fire hit areas outside the yellow line. In the south, tanks and helicopters targeted territory northeast of Rafah and the outskirts of Khan Younis.

“There are extensive Israeli attacks beyond the yellow line that have led to the systematic destruction of Gaza’s eastern neighbourhoods,” Abu Azzoum said.

Testimonies gathered by families, he added, point to a “systematic attempt to destroy Gaza’s neighbourhoods and create buffer zones, making these areas completely uninhabitable, which complicates a return for families”.

In central Gaza, civil defence teams, operating with police and Red Cross support, recovered the bodies of eight members of a single family from the rubble of their home in the Maghazi camp, the Palestinian Wafa news agency reported, which was struck in an earlier Israeli attack.

The Gaza Government Media Office said the number of bodies retrieved since the ceasefire began has now reached 582, while more than 9,500 Palestinians remain missing beneath the ruins of bombed-out districts.

Captive’s body recovered

The Palestinian Islamic Jihad, an armed group allied with Hamas, meanwhile, announced it had recovered the body of an Israeli captive in Nuseirat camp in central Gaza.

If the body is identified, two more will have to be recovered under the first phase of the Gaza ceasefire deal. Israel is supposed to return the bodies of 15 Palestinians in exchange for each captive’s body.

Hamas has previously said the widespread destruction has hampered efforts to locate the remaining bodies.

Also on Monday, the GHF, a US-backed entity that operated parallel to United Nations aid structures, announced the end of its activities in Gaza.

The organisation cited provisions in the October ceasefire as the reason for its withdrawal.

UN experts say at least 859 Palestinians were killed around GHF distribution points since May 2025, with Israeli forces and foreign contractors regularly opening fire on crowds desperately seeking food.

The scheme drew widespread condemnation for bypassing established humanitarian channels.

Israeli attacks on the West Bank

Across the occupied West Bank, Israeli forces stepped up raids overnight, arresting at least 16 Palestinians, according to Wafa. Arrests were reported in Iktaba near Tulkarem, in Tuqu southeast of Bethlehem, in Kobar near Ramallah, and in Silat al-Harithiya west of Jenin.

Israeli troops also detained residents in Tubas and the surrounding areas.

Violence escalated further on Sunday night when Israeli forces killed a 20-year-old law student, Baraa Khairi Ali Maali, in Deir Jarir, north of Ramallah.

Wafa reported that clashes erupted after Israeli settlers attacked Palestinian homes on the village’s outskirts. Fathi Hamdan, head of the local council, said troops entered the village to protect the settlers, then opened fire on Palestinians confronting them.

Maali suffered a gunshot wound to the chest and died shortly after arrival at hospital. His killing follows the fatal shooting of another young man by settlers in Deir Jarir last month.

Elsewhere in the West Bank, Israeli soldiers injured two Palestinian women and detained two brothers during a raid in Kafr Qaddum, east of Qalqilya.

Settler attacks also continued. Fires were set on agricultural land between Atara and Birzeit, north of Ramallah, destroying farmland belonging to residents.

In a separate incident in Atara, settlers from a newly established outpost torched olive trees and stole farming equipment.

Israeli settler violence has surged over the past two years; since October 7, 2023, at least 1,081 Palestinians have been killed in the occupied West Bank by Israeli forces and settlers, including 223 children, with more than 10,614 wounded and more than 20,500 arrested.

Israeli ceasefire violations in Lebanon

In Lebanon, Hezbollah held a funeral for senior commander Haytham Ali Tabatabai, assassinated by Israel on Sunday.

Images from Beirut’s southern suburbs showed mourners carrying his coffin, wrapped in yellow and green, as Hezbollah flags lined the streets. The group has not yet announced how it will respond.

Mahmoud Qmati, vice president of Hezbollah’s Political Council, called the killing “yet another ceasefire violation”, accusing Israel of escalating the conflict “with the green light given by the United States”.

Security analyst Ali Rizk said Hezbollah is weighing its options carefully, warning that the group is unlikely to “give Netanyahu an excuse to launch an all-out war against Lebanon”, which he said could be more devastating than the current limited exchanges.

Geopolitical analyst Joe Macaron said the US is “no longer restraining Israel” and is instead supporting Israeli operations in Syria, Gaza and Lebanon.

Reporting from Beirut, Al Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr said that Hezbollah, in turn, faces a strategic dilemma: retaliation could risk a massive Israeli assault, yet inaction could erode its deterrence.

Imad Salamey of the Lebanese American University said any Hezbollah response could be met with a “severe” Israeli reaction.

Speaking to Al Jazeera, he added that Israel’s right-wing government “is eager to escalate because escalation will serve that government staying in power”.

Salamey argued that Hezbollah’s deterrence capacity has been “severely damaged” and that the group “no longer has the support it used to have or the logistical routes it used to utilise via Syria”.",figurative
"In April 2022, the wild and inquisitively wilful British free-jazz keyboardist and composer Pat Thomas was improvising with his eyes shut in the company of his quartet أحمد [Ahmed] at Glasgow’s Glue Factory. The music was dedicated to the 1950s-70s legacy of the late Art Blakey and Thelonious Monk bassist, oud player and early global-music pioneer Ahmed Abdul-Malik, the inspiration for the group’s work. When Thomas emerged from his trance, he was astonished to hear that an ecstatic crowd had been dancing the night away around him.

View image in fullscreen The artwork for Sama’a (Audition) by أحمد [Ahmed].

He shouldn’t have been surprised. Since أحمد [Ahmed]’s inception, their collective heat has fused abstract improv and groove music from all over the world: Duke Ellington, Thelonious Monk, dub, jungle, electronics, and the 1990s free-improv of Derek Bailey, Lol Coxhill and drummer Steve Noble have all inspired Thomas. Saxophonist Seymour Wright has absorbed the sax vocabulary of Evan Parker and the insights into collective improv and avant-swing of AMM drummer and teacher Eddie Prévost. Eclectic partners Joel Grip (bass) and Antonin Gerbal (drums) power and expand these infectious, volatile energies.

The Arabic term sama’a loosely translates as meditative listening to music and poetry, taken from Thomas’s perspective as a follower of Sufism, and this new set’s four tracks manifest that spirit. The opening Ya Annas (Oh, People) joins ghostly split-note sax sounds with graceful bowed-bass figures before turning to a pulsating piano-vamping dance and then a furious melee, while Isma’a (Listen) is a drum’n’bass hook that evolves into hoarsely urgent free-sax improv against exhilaratingly splashy, pummelling piano chords. El Haris (Anxious) resolves brittle, pad-flapping horn exhalations and long-tone harmonies into a gripping robotic strut, and Farah ‘Alaiyna (Joy Upon Us) begins as delightfully dissonant folk-dance and becomes rocketing jazz swing. The group’s Monk tribute follows in 2026 which on this evidence is a riveting prospect.

Also out this month

Guitarist John Scofield and bassist Dave Holland have been regular collaborators for years, but Memories of Home (ECM) is their first duo album, equally sharing their boppishly hip, country-bluesy, warmly engaging originals. Scofield’s voicelike harmonies and sure-footed chord-rooted improv on his dreamy Meant to Be, and Holland’s deep, enveloping tone on his luxuriously languid swinger Mr B (Dedicated to Ray Brown) are highlights of a very classy set.

Unseparate (Out of Your Head), the second release by Canadian composer and flautist/saxophonist Anna Webber’s powerful big band co-led with her saxophonist compatriot Angela Morris, joins this inventive pair’s jazz, contemporary-classical and folk enthusiasms in a subtle balance of their ingenious arrangements and their fine young lineup’s improv ideas.

And UK composer Mike Westbrook’s epic 1980 session The Cortège – a celebration of landmark 20th-century European literature as well as cutting-edge jazz – reappears as the previously unissued The Cortège Live at the BBC 1980 (Cadillac).",literal
"Supposedly feuding for over 25 years might be bad karma, but it’s great for ticket sales. Of course, Brandy and Monica aren’t actually fighting, they just did such a good job of pretending to hate each other on their 1998 duet The Boy Is Mine that the world has been convinced of it ever since. The R&B legends have taken pains to point out that their relationship is harmonious in multiple interviews leading up to this 32-date co-headline tour, even making fun of the drama in a recent Dunkin advert that featured them fighting over a frappe.

Happily, Brandy and Monica’s sisterhood also means they’re playing their biggest venues in decades. After emerging on stage from a vintage elevator wearing sunglasses and scowling expressions, the duo launches into a kind of sing-and-dance-off, trading places and performing a trio of classics apiece as the other watches with disdain. It’s a knowing nod to their purported rivalry that begins to take on the feeling of a variety segment, which isn’t helped by the trimming of songs like What About Us? and Like This and Like That to 90 seconds apiece. Even so, their camaraderie shines through as Brandy quickly breaks character to sway and sing along to Monica’s Don’t Take It Personal (Just One Of Dem Days), a showcase for her slightly raspy, soulful vocals during which she winds her hips and aims gun fingers at the audience.

Brandy and Monica’s respective music shines brightest tonight in their solo sets. Brandy’s mid-tempo Full Moon is already impossible to sing by 99% of people, but she confirms her honorific as the “vocal Bible” by further complicating it tonight, adding in extra octave-scaling runs and ad-libs. She’s captivating in tightly choreographed performances of Afrodisiac and Who Is She 2 U, and a certified kook to boot, gently needling her co-headliner like a sassy sibling. After Monica delivers a heartfelt speech about how her partner has taught her that love can cross oceans, Brandy’s eyebrows shoot upwards and she quickly informs the audience: “She still can’t swim!”

It doesn’t seem that any live instruments were involved in tonight’s show, save for the organ that accompanies Brandy’s gorgeous rendition of the Never Say Never deep cut Put That on Everything. That doesn’t deter Monica, who adds a dash of Las Vegas camp to Street Symphony with shirtless male dancers and prop violins. The First Night is extended into a Diana Ross mashup that plays off the song’s Love Hangover sample, performed with hip-hop moves and a shiny cane. Razzle-dazzle isn’t always needed to pack a punch, though. Her pristine vocals fill the arena during a stripped-down, belting rendition of Angel of Mine, a tender love song with attitude and bite.

Other moments are more jarring. While there are minimal stage changes throughout the show, elaborate and strange video interludes punctuate the show’s six acts: one features Brandy and Monica as marionettes that get tied up together in a bundle of puppet strings, while others recap their chart achievements and memorable videos as if they’re an X Factor guest about to perform. As well as three opening acts (Kelly Rowland, Muni Long, and recent American Idol winner Jamal Roberts), tonight’s show also features a slightly perplexing array of special guests including Ciara, who performs a brilliantly athletic four-song medley, as well as Fat Joe, Tyrese and NYC cult rapper Max B. “If you got time, we got time,” beams Monica around three-quarters through the show, as Fabolous strides on to the stage to perform Into You. Ma’am, it is 11.30pm on a school night.

Soon, Brandy and Monica reunite on stage. In tribute to Whitney Houston, who mentored both artists, the pair duet on a fun, loose cover of I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me), before closing the show out with – what else? – The Boy Is Mine. On a stage filled with dry ice, the pair go all in on scenery-chewing, as Brandy tosses her hair and stamps her feet while Monica purses her lips and rolls her eyes. It’s been a strange couple of hours to get here, but the reward is a sing-off for the ages.",literal
