"Sweaty, maddening, sleepless. That’s what it was like to be part of Cop30 in Brazil. And yet more than 190 countries came together in the rainforest of the Amazon and reaffirmed their faith in multilateralism, the Paris agreement and the need to redouble our efforts to keep global warming to 1.5C.

We went to Cop because working with other countries to tackle the climate crisis is the only way to protect our home and way of life. We know the UK produces just 1% of emissions, which is why, as the prime minister said in Belém, our government is “all-in” on working with others to reduce the remaining 99%.

We also know there are huge opportunities from driving the transition forward, which is why in Britain we are making historic investments in renewables and nuclear, upgrading millions of homes, and acting to protect nature.

It is true that Britain wanted more from this Cop, including details of how we would speed up the global energy transition through an agreement that explicitly pledged a roadmap for the transition away from fossil fuels. This didn’t happen because some countries would not agree.

Yet on this issue, we have seen the emergence of an impressive coalition of 83 countries from the global north and global south, backed by more than 140 global businesses and civil society groups. And Brazil will launch a roadmap to help countries transition away from fossil fuels and scale up clean energy.

This offers such an important lesson: that detailed negotiations matter, but the movements we build around them profoundly influence what can be delivered. The roadmap to achieve our goal to halt and reverse deforestation by 2030 offers the same opportunity to drive forward our global efforts to tackle the nature and climate crises together.

There is also a larger picture here. This year’s summit was a test of whether, at a time of political challenge, countries would keep working together on the greatest collective threat we face or, with the US stepping out of the Paris agreement, there might be a domino effect of others departing. For all the challenges, countries chose the path of cooperation.

Cop30 therefore forms part of the long history of these negotiations that have seen the world change its trajectory from 4C of warming around a decade ago to 2.3- 2.5C. Despite that progress, our goal is 1.5C for a reason – because the science is clear that every fraction of a degree matters in limiting the impacts people will face here and around the world. That is why it is important that the world has pledged to enhance efforts to meet it through the Belém Mission to 1.5 and Global Implementation Accelerator.

Ambition on emissions reduction goes hand-in-hand with finance to make that possible, including for developing countries. Last year, countries agreed that, by 2035, we would need to mobilise at least $300bn (£230bn) of climate finance annually for developing countries. This year, as a core part of our fight against climate change, we agreed that this finance needs to be targeted at aiming to treble the support to building resilience to climate impacts.

Our Brazilian hosts were determined to make this the implementation Cop – and much progress was made outside the negotiating halls. This was, of course, the first Cop in the Amazon, and the UK was proud to work with Brazil in the two years running up to the summit to help it develop the Tropical Forest Forever Facility, which offers an incredibly inspiring solution to global deforestation.

We also worked alongside Brazil and many others on the Global Climate Action Agenda, which is about building the coalitions spanning governments, businesses, cities and civil society needed to accelerate action on the ground – on issues from reducing methane emissions and phasing out coal, to unlocking investment in clean energy.

Thousands of British businesses were involved in these initiatives. Our researchers, universities, mayors and others were also deeply engaged on climate issues at this Cop. And the UK was key to delivering the final outcomes of this summit, because of our record of climate leadership at home and abroad, as well as the extraordinary skill and determination of our civil service.

The message coming out of Belém was clear: despite the noise, clean energy and climate action remain the foundation on which the global economy is being remade and rebuilt. We are up against the march of time and massive global forces that would slow down or stop action. In the face of this opposition, multilateralism is our best hope. For all its flaws, Cop has reaffirmed the belief of the vast majority of the world in this ideal. Those who would deny or prevent action are not winning the argument, they are losing.",figurative
"With U.S. leadership in doubt, can its allies chart their own course?

Ben Bland is the director of the Asia-Pacific Program at Chatham House, an international policy think tank based in London. He is also the author of two books on Asian politics.

Even before President Trump returned to the White House earlier this year, conversations with diplomatic and security officials across Europe and Asia revealed a deep contradiction. On the one hand, U.S. allies fear the breakdown of the international order that has underpinned their stability in recent decades. On the other, they are hesitant to invest in the structural changes needed to adapt to a more uncertain world.

But this may be changing. U.S. allies in Europe and the Indo-Pacific have shown an increasing willingness in recent months to coordinate and cooperate across a wide range of shared interests, from trade to defense and alliance management to China. As democratic middle powers that are committed to open trade and investment, the U.K., France and Germany, Washington's most important European allies, have much in common with Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea, the Indo-Pacific pillars of the U.S. alliance system.

The foreign ministers of these seven countries and Poland, another key European security player, met recently on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York, acknowledging that ""peace, security and resilience in the Indo-Pacific and Europe are becoming more intertwined"". Meeting in a new format, and without the U.S. present even while on U.S. soil, they promised to cooperate more closely on maritime security, cybersecurity, economic security, climate change and broader geopolitical uncertainties.

On economic policy, these countries are looking to shield themselves from Beijing's weaponization of its dominance in manufacturing and emerging technologies. They are also seeking better defenses against growing protectionist pressures emanating from the U.S., which pre-date the return of President Trump to the White House.

How can U.S. allies organize among themselves?

Whether or not autarky makes sense for a superpower like America, its allies in Europe and the Indo-Pacific will suffer in a world where barriers to trade and investment continue to rise. Large, advanced, open economies such as the U.K., France, Germany, Japan, South Korea and Australia will need to work much harder together in the coming years to defend the free flow of goods, services and investments.

One avenue for doing so is cooperation around the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), a regional trade agreement that was backed by Washington before President Trump withdrew in 2017. Australia, Japan, New Zealand and the U.K. are CPTPP members, while South Korea is considering joining, and the European Union has discussed deepening trade linkages with the CPTPP.

Another area where these nations could form a stronger coalition is technology. Both China and the U.S. are taking ever more assertive measures as they vie for leadership in key technologies from artificial intelligence and semiconductors to electric vehicle batteries. None of Washington's major allies have the financial heft or corporate base to compete in their own right. But they can pool knowledge and resources to try to ensure they are not left behind. And they can discuss how to prevent being isolated in a world of bifurcating technological systems and standards.

On defense and intelligence, there is clearly no substitute for the anchor role that Washington plays. However, European and Indo-Pacific allies are already expanding the linkages between themselves, rather than relying on the U.S. for leadership, connections and defense procurement. For example, instead of procuring fighters from the U.S., Italy, Japan and the U.K. are already working together to develop their own next-generation aircraft under the Global Combat Air Program. This could be the start of a broader push to interweave defense and security between allies in Europe and the Indo-Pacific.

Overcoming tensions and leading without a leader

This shift is not about severing ties with Washington. On the contrary, it is about reacting to changes in U.S. domestic politics, and ensuring that U.S. allies in Europe and the Indo-Pacific can make more meaningful contributions in their own right.

However, coordinating between middle powers in Europe and Asia without the heft of U.S. leadership will be challenging.

Within the EU, France and Germany still clash, with their own joint fighter jet program, the Future Combat Air System, in doubt because of political wrangling and commercial rivalry. The U.K. is mending fences with its European neighbors after Brexit but standing outside the EU makes defense and industrial cooperation difficult.

In the Indo-Pacific, the historical tensions between Japan and South Korea have in the past limited their ability to cooperate with the U.S. and other allies.

It will take vision to look beyond these tensions and smart leadership to find creative, flexible and cost-effective solutions. If U.S. allies in Europe and the Indo-Pacific fail to do more together, alone they will not have the resources or scale to thrive in these uncertain times.

"A federal judge dismissed the criminal indictments against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James on Monday, finding the prosecutor who brought the cases, former Trump attorney Lindsey Halligan, was not lawfully appointed.

U.S. District Judge Cameron Currie said she agreed with Comey, who moved to dismiss the case on the grounds that Halligan's appointment was illegal.

""Because Ms. Halligan had no lawful authority to present the indictment, I will grant Mr. Comey’s motion and dismiss the indictment,"" Currie wrote in finding that Halligan lacked the authority to present a case to a grand jury.

""All actions flowing from Ms. Halligan’s defective appointment, including securing and signing Mr. Comey’s indictment, were unlawful exercises of executive power and are hereby set aside,"" the judge wrote, describing the insurance lawyer as ""a former White House aide with no prior prosecutorial experience.""

She issued a separate, similar ruling dismissing the James case.

“This case presents the unique, if not unprecedented, situation where an unconstitutionally appointed prosecutor, 'exercising power [she] did not lawfully possess,’… acted alone in conducting a grand jury proceeding and securing an indictment,” the ruling said.

Because Halligan, who was appointed interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia at President Donald Trump's direction, was the only prosecutor to present the cases and sign the indictments, the indictments should be voided, the judge found.

Attorney General Pam Bondi reacted to the dismissal of the cases by saying during a news conference in Memphis that the Justice Department will ""be taking all available legal action, including an immediate appeal.""

Bondi also defended Halligan, calling her ""an excellent"" attorney.

After the ruling, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters, “Lindsey Halligan was legally appointed, and that’s the administration’s position.”

The U.S. attorney’s office for the Eastern District of Virginia declined to comment. Halligan did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Comey, in a video on Instagram, said, ""I’m grateful that the court ended the case against me, which was a prosecution based on malevolence and incompetence and a reflection of what the Department of Justice has become under Donald Trump, which is heartbreaking.""

“This case mattered to me personally, obviously, but it matters most because a message has to be sent that the president of the United States cannot use the Department of Justice to target his political enemies,” he said.

""I know that Donald Trump will probably come after me again, and my attitude is going to be the same. I’m innocent. I am not afraid, and I believe in an independent federal judiciary, the gift from our founders that protects us from a would-be tyrant,"" he added.

Responding to Comey's statement, Bondi told reporters that she was ""not worried about someone who has been charged with a very serious crime,"" adding that ""his alleged actions were a betrayal of public trust.”

James praised the judge's ruling.

“I am heartened by today’s victory and grateful for the prayers and support I have received from around the country. I remain fearless in the face of these baseless charges as I continue fighting for New Yorkers every single day,” she said in a statement.

Her attorney, Abbe Lowell, said in a statement that the judge's order ""acknowledges what’s been clear about this case from the beginning. The President went to extreme measures to substitute one of his allies to bring these baseless charges after career prosecutors refused.""

""We will continue to challenge any further politically motivated charges through every lawful means available,” Lowell said.

Both indictments were dismissed ""without prejudice,"" meaning they could be brought again later.

Comey attorney Patrick Fitzgerald said in a statement that his reading of the ruling suggests the case can't be refiled because the five-year statute of limitations has expired since the indictment was brought.

Fitzgerald said the ruling ""indicates that because the indictment is void, the statute of limitations has run and there can be no further indictment.""

The Justice Department has said in court papers that it believes the case could still move forward because of U.S. Code 3288. The federal statute says in part, “Whenever an indictment or information charging a felony is dismissed for any reason after the period prescribed by the applicable statute of limitations has expired, a new indictment may be returned in the appropriate jurisdiction within six calendar months of the date of the dismissal of the indictment or information.”

Comey's attorneys have countered that the six-month grace period doesn't apply in this case because Halligan didn't have the power to bring an indictment to begin with, so all of her official actions are void — a prospect the judge expressly agreed with.

Comey and James have other motions pending before the judges presiding over their cases, contending the charges should be dismissed because they are the result of “selective and vindictive” prosecutions. Those motions seek to have the cases tossed ""with prejudice,"" meaning prosecutors couldn’t revive them.

Carl Tobias, the Williams Chair in Law at the University of Richmond School of Law, told NBC News that Monday's ruling would be difficult for the government to overcome.

“I think the government will do whatever it can to overturn this, but I don’t see how that’s going to happen,” he said.

The invalidation of Halligan’s appointment was fatal to the Comey and James indictments because of the unique role Halligan played in the cases against two of Trump’s political enemies, and it could have ripple effects on other cases that were handled under more typical processes.

Another high-profile defendant being prosecuted by Halligan's office, Kabul airport bombing suspect Mohammad Sharifullah, also filed a challenge to her appointment this month, charging she doesn't have the authority to supervise or participate in his case. Sharifullah was indicted by Halligan’s predecessor, and his motion is still pending.

A ruling disqualifying Alina Habba as the U.S. attorney in New Jersey has resulted in a number of criminal cases brought under her leadership being stuck in legal limbo while she appeals the decision.

Currie seemed largely skeptical of the Justice Department's defense of Halligan at a rare joint hearing on the issue with lawyers for Comey and James on Nov. 13, when a prosecutor portrayed questions about Halligan's appointment as ""a paperwork error.""

Comey's attorney said it was much more than that and a ""fatal flaw"" in the prosecution of his client.

Comey was indicted on charges of making a false statement to Congress and obstructing a congressional investigation, while James was indicted on charges of bank fraud and making a false statement to a financial institution. Both pleaded not guilty.

In a highly unusual move, Halligan was the lone prosecutor to present their cases to the grand jury and the lone prosecutor to sign their indictments. Other prosecutors in her office had recommended against charging Comey and James because they didn't believe there was enough evidence to secure convictions, NBC News previously reported.

Trump said he was naming Halligan U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia on Sept. 20 — the day after he forced out his initial pick, Erik Siebert, who resisted pressure to prosecute Comey and James.

Halligan's appointment was immediately viewed as problematic because, according to federal statute, people in that post may serve for only 120 days after having been appointed U.S. attorney unless they are confirmed by the Senate before then.

The Senate had not confirmed Siebert, so federal judges of the Eastern District of Virginia exercised their independent appointment authority to keep him on beyond the 120-day limit.

Lawyers for Comey and James contended that after Siebert was forced out, the responsibility for naming his replacement belonged to the judges, not Attorney General Pam Bondi. To rule otherwise, Comey's attorney said in a filing, would render the 120-day period ""meaningless, and the Attorney General could indefinitely evade the alternate procedures that Congress mandated.""

The Justice Department maintained that Halligan's appointment was valid since the office was vacant after Siebert's departure. The ""Senate has not refused advice and consent to Ms. Halligan — her nomination remains pending. The Attorney General therefore lawfully appointed Ms. Halligan as interim U.S. Attorney"" and ""the motions to dismiss should be denied,"" the Justice Department said in a filing.

Trump's Truth Social post naming Halligan to the position came the day after Siebert was forced out — and shortly after another social media post in which he publicly urged Bondi to push ahead with prosecutions of Comey, James and another perceived political adversary, Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California.

""Pam: I have reviewed over 30 statements and posts saying that, essentially, 'same old story as last time, all talk, no action. Nothing is being done. What about Comey, Adam ‘Shifty’ Schiff, Leticia??? They’re all guilty as hell, but nothing is going to be done,'” said the post, which a source previously confirmed to NBC News had been intended as a direct message to Bondi, not a public post.

""We can’t delay any longer, it’s killing our reputation and credibility,"" Trump continued, while praising Halligan as ""a really good lawyer.""

Five days after the post, Halligan, who had no prosecutorial experience, presented the Comey case to a grand jury. The presentation came days before a five-year statute of limitations on the charges was set to expire.

Currie, a Bill Clinton appointee who is based in South Carolina, heard the arguments on the disqualification issue instead of a judge from the Eastern District of Virginia since local judges would be involved in selecting Halligan's replacement.

The Trump administration's stance on the 120-day rule has led to U.S. attorneys in California and Nevada being disqualified, as well. The Justice Department is appealing those rulings.",figurative
"Opinion: Farewell, equid program

toggle caption Mark Wilson/Getty Images/Getty Images North America

Some honored veterans will soon be let out to pasture. The U.S. Army has announced plans to dramatically scale back its Military Working Equid program. 141 of the 236 horses, donkeys, and mules who work for the U.S. military, mostly in ceremonial processions, are being put up for adoption.

Those four-legged troopers ""are part of the Army family,"" Army spokesperson Steve Warren told reporters. ""We're going to treat them with compassion.""

U.S. Army horses have not been deployed in combat since the 26th Cavalry Regiment led a mounted charge in the Battle of Bataan in 1942. (A dozen Green Berets did ride on horseback during the war in Afghanistan, but they were supplied by their Afghan allies, the Northern Alliance.)

Yet a horse who serves their country is no less vital when their service is mostly ceremonial — in parades, honor guards, and funerals.

""The horses were never just horses,"" Captain Lydia Laga, a public affairs officer for the 3rd Combat Aviation Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division, wrote in The Military Times. ""They were part of a living, breathing connection to American military heritage, bridges to a time when thundering hooves marked both ceremony and strategy... a piece of Army culture that stood defiantly in contrast to the digital age.""

I have been to military funerals at Arlington National Cemetery, sometimes as a reporter, sometimes as a mourner. There is something extraordinary and eloquent in seeing horses pull the caisson that bears the casket of a fallen soldier, under the folds of the stars and stripes.

The clop of the horse's hooves is a kind of muted drumroll. The horses, so beautifully trained, are elegant and stately.

Their presence seems a symbol. Soldiers may serve at different ranks, and over different decades. But whether the deceased was a four-star general, or long-retired infantryman who came under fire in battles long ago, the U.S. Army, and the American people, memorialize their service with the same respect and ritual: Army horses bring them to a final rest.

Paring back the Working Equid program should save the Army about $2 million a year — out of an annual budget of more than $185 billion. But they will continue to keep ceremonial animals at Arlington National Cemetery and Joint Base San Antonio. Those horses will continue to serve as only they can.",figurative
"Top diplomats from the US, EU and Ukraine are meeting in Geneva to discuss Donald Trump’s 28-point proposal to end the war with Russia.

Top United States officials are holding talks with Ukrainian and European diplomats in Geneva to discuss US President Donald Trump’s peace plan aimed at ending the nearly four-year-old war between Russia and Ukraine.

But the so-called 28-point plan pushed by the Trump administration has alarmed Ukraine and its European allies, who see it as a capitulation to Russian demands, particularly territorial concessions and limits on the size of Ukraine’s military.

Trump had set a November 27 deadline for Ukraine to accept his peace plan, but after pushback from European leaders, Washington appears to have softened its stance, with Trump saying the plan did not represent a “final offer” for Ukraine.

This will likely create some wriggle room for diplomacy at the high-stakes talks in Geneva, Switzerland.

So, why are Ukraine’s European allies opposed to the draft plan? Who’s participating? What’s on the agenda in Geneva? And does the plan favour Moscow?

What’s on the agenda at the US-Ukraine talks in Geneva?

The talks are an attempt to reconcile the contentious draft peace plan, as Kyiv and its European allies want Kyiv’s long-term security interests protected.

Representatives from Ukraine, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and the European Union will join top US officials, including US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, to discuss how to end the war – Europe’s deadliest since World War II. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said there will also be a Russian presence.

The talks, Al Jazeera’s Hashem Ahelbarra said, “could be the most decisive moment for Ukraine”.

“There is a great deal of anxiety among Ukrainians and Europeans about the nature of the 28-plan drafted by the Americans,” said Ahelbarra, reporting from Geneva.

“The concerns are about the territorial concessions: We’re talking about Luhansk, Donetsk and Crimea, which the Ukrainians, as per the plan, have to give up in exchange for the potential of a permanent deal with Russia. They have to freeze the front lines, particularly in Kherson and Zaporizhia.

“The third element is the reduction of the capacity of the Ukrainian armed forces from 900,000 soldiers to 600,000, and this is widely perceived by the Ukrainians as a major concession they cannot afford to make,” Ahelbarra said.

In a post on X on Sunday, Zelenskyy said he hopes “there will be a result”.

“The bloodshed must be stopped, and we must ensure that the war is never reignited,” the Ukrainian leader said. “I am awaiting the results of today’s talks and hope that all participants will be constructive. We all need a positive outcome.”

Who is participating in the talks?

The US’s Rubio and Witkoff are leading the Geneva talks, which will also include US Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll.

Nine Ukrainian officials are attending the talks, including Ukraine’s presidential office chief Andriy Yermak and top envoy Rustem Umerov, who have been empowered to deal directly with Russia by the president.

National security advisers from the E3 alliance of France, Britain and Germany will also join the discussions, alongside other officials from the EU, including Italy.

Why are European leaders raising concerns about Trump’s peace plan?

Ukraine’s European allies say the current peace plan does not address Ukraine’s security concerns. They say Russia cannot be rewarded with territory for invading Ukraine.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Sunday that “any credible and sustainable peace plan should first and foremost stop the killing and end the war, while not sowing the seeds for a future conflict”.

She spelled out three elements required for a just and lasting peace, stating that borders should not be changed by force, that there should not be a cap on Ukraine’s military, and that the EU should be central to securing peace for Ukraine.

“Ukraine must have the freedom and sovereign right to choose its own destiny. They have chosen a European destiny,” von der Leyen said.

On the sidelines of the Group of 20 (G20) summit in Johannesburg, South Africa on Saturday, European and other Western leaders pushed back against Trump’s plan, saying it required “additional work”.

“We are ready to engage in order to ensure that a future peace is sustainable. We are clear on the principle that borders must not be changed by force,” said a joint statement signed by the UK, Canada, Finland, France, Spain, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Germany, Norway and the Republic of Ireland.

The statement noted that the allies were “concerned by the proposed limitations on Ukraine’s armed forces, which would leave Ukraine vulnerable to future attack”, adding that any decisions regarding NATO and the EU would require the consent of member states.

Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 and has since captured large parts of the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk region. Moscow had annexed the Crimean Peninsula in 2014.

According to Trump’s draft plan, Crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk will be recognised as de facto Russian territory. Ukrainian forces will be required to withdraw from parts of Donetsk that they currently control, while Kherson and Zaporizhia will be frozen along the line of contact.

The proposed plan would also see Ukraine cut its army and renounce its ambitions to join NATO, which has been a major sticking point in the earlier proposals. The size of the Ukrainian armed forces will be limited to 600,000 personnel.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said that he spoke with Trump in a long phone call on Friday and conveyed that Europe needed to be a part of any peace process.

“An end to the war can only be achieved with the unconditional consent of Ukraine,” Merz said during the G20 summit briefing. “But we are still quite a way from a good outcome for everyone.”

Von der Leyen noted that a key principle for Kyiv’s European allies was “nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine”.

Speaking with reporters ahead of the G20 summit, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said, “Time and again, Russia pretends to be serious about peace, but their actions never live up to their words.”

French President Emmanuel Macron said on Saturday that Russia would “betray” its promise and “come back” if there are no elements of deterrence and if Ukraine were to cut its army size and follow Trump’s plan.

In a post on X, Macron welcomed US efforts to bring peace, but said that the current proposal “must be strengthened” and “Ukraine must never be left vulnerable”.

Macron wrote, “Everyone wants peace – except Russia, which continues to stubbornly bomb Ukraine”, adding that support for Ukraine was “decisive”.

EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said: “Russia has no legal right whatsoever to any concessions from the country it invaded.”

But US Vice President JD Vance has rebuked criticism of the peace plan.

“There is a fantasy that if we just give more money, more weapons, or more sanctions, victory is at hand,” the vice president posted on X on Saturday. “Peace won’t be made by failed diplomats or politicians living in a fantasy land. It might be made by smart people living in the real world.”

What has Ukraine’s Zelenskyy said about the plan?

Zelenskyy said that Ukraine was trying to defend its sovereignty while retaining the support of its most important ally, the United States. Trump had said Zelenskyy can “fight his little heart out” if he rejected the proposal.

“Now is one of the most difficult moments of our history. Now, the pressure on Ukraine is one of the heaviest. Now, Ukraine can face a very difficult choice — either losing dignity or risk losing a major partner,” Zelenskky said.

In a 10-minute speech outside the presidential palace, Zelenskyy said that if his country follows through on the proposed plan, it would leave Kyiv “without freedom, dignity and justice”.

Accepting the plan, which has been widely viewed as favouring Moscow, would also mean believing “someone who has already attacked us twice”, said Zelenskyy.

“I will present arguments, I will persuade, I will propose alternatives,” said the Ukrainian president. He then referred to the Russian invasion in February 2022, saying: “We did not betray Ukraine then, we will not do so now.”

On Sunday, Zelenskyy said that Ukraine’s focus at the talks is “on working as constructively as possible on the steps proposed by the United States”.

“We are working to ensure that the path toward ending the war is real and that the principled elements are put into action,” he said after a call with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.

Does Trump’s peace plan favour Moscow?

European leaders are concerned that Trump’s proposal heavily favours Russia, which has been seeking to control all of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Moscow currently holds parts of that territory, though it has been slowly gaining more ground on the battlefronts.

A group of US senators said on Saturday that they were told by Rubio, who is also Trump’s national security adviser, that the widely leaked draft peace plan did not reflect the US position, but was a Russian “wish list”.

“It looked more like it was written in Russian to begin with,” Senator Mike Rounds, a Republican from South Dakota, said at a security conference in Canada.

However, Rubio denied the assertions, insisting that the plan was “authored by the US” and it was “based on input” from both Russia and Ukraine.

Rounds said he had been assured that the plan was presented to Witkoff, Trump’s overseas envoy, by “someone … representing Russia”. The senator continued: “It is not our recommendation. It is not our peace plan.”

Later, a US Department of State spokesperson said Rounds’s account of his conversation with Rubio was “blatantly false”.

Russian President Vladimir Putin, meanwhile, said Washington’s 28-point plan could “lay the foundation for a final peace settlement”.

Putin also threatened to seize more territory if Ukraine does not accept the proposal, warning that the reported capture of the Ukrainian city of Kupiansk “will inevitably be repeated in other key areas of the front line”.

Speaking from Kyiv, journalist Audrey MacAlpine said Russia has been making battlefield gains in regions of Ukraine where the peace proposal would hand it territory along the line of contact.

She told Al Jazeera that Moscow had carried out overnight attacks on Kherson and Zaporizhia, two regions where Russia would gain de facto control under the 28-point plan being discussed in Geneva.

“No doubt Russia is trying to make gains in these particular regions, and they’ve been successful,” she said. “They’ve been making slow but concerted gains.”

Is Trump likely to seal the peace deal this time?

We do not know yet.

During his presidential campaign leading up to the 2024 US election, Trump claimed that he could end Russia’s war on Ukraine within a day. But a deal proved elusive despite Washington’s diplomatic push.

Since returning to power for a second term in January, Trump has made resolving foreign conflicts central to US foreign policy. He claimed to have helped end several wars, including Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza, the India-Pakistan war, and the Thailand-Cambodia war, among others. Trump even asked for a Nobel Peace Prize for stopping wars.

But he has struggled to end the Russia-Ukraine conflict, despite holding a summit with Putin in Alaska in August.

Trump’s first meeting with Zelenskyy ended in acrimony back in February. The US president made up with the Ukrainian leader, hosting him twice at the White House since the February White House meeting. But his attempt to organise a meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy has not materialised.

In August, Trump warned Russia of severe consequences if Putin refused to end the war. He even announced sanctions on Moscow to force it to end the war. He also slapped hefty tariffs on India for buying Russian oil, which he said was financing Moscow’s war efforts.

As the talks were under way in Geneva on Sunday, Trump again took aim at Ukraine, saying Kyiv has not been grateful for American efforts related to the war with Russia.

“UKRAINE ‘LEADERSHIP’ HAS EXPRESSED ZERO GRATITUDE FOR OUR EFFORTS, AND EUROPE CONTINUES TO BUY OIL FROM RUSSIA. THE USA CONTINUES TO SELL MASSIVE $AMOUNTS OF WEAPONS TO NATO, FOR DISTRIBUTION TO UKRAINE,” Trump said in a Truth Social post on X, echoing remarks he made during a heated exchange in the White House in February in which Trump and US Vice President JD Vance berated Zelenskyy.",literal
"Just a few months ago, it seemed that the political landscape was changing permanently, with young people shifting right – especially young men. Democrats spun up a vortex of efforts to win them back, but they often appeared to be flailing. This month’s elections, however, told a different story.

Young men in the US face a political identity crisis. It should not be controversial to say that the world that many were promised as children has not come to fruition. Two decades of war and a turbulent economy have combined with a massively changing workforce. Young men’s disaffection should come as no real surprise.

An entire ecosystem of hucksters has emerged to take advantage of these young people, peddling a dark vision that offers violence and control as a response to a changing world. Meanwhile, the Democratic party failed to imagine a political future that included these young men. In Democrats’ parlance, anyone who took one step in that direction was hopelessly lost, unable to see the beautiful egalitarian future that we could create together.

There is a fine line here. I am not arguing for the redemption, welcome, or whitewashing of the people who have peddled this bleak reality. But we can and should build a political coalition that includes this generation, that doesn’t leave them out in the cold, only to find a home in the most bleak fringes of a political movement that tells them that a lust for control over other people, especially women, is the only way to find meaning.

On the left, we tell ourselves the story of our own vaunted sympathy, and yet we assign only blame to the young men who do something similar, looking for community and only finding it among the most opportunistic and dangerous political movements. We have done little to welcome them in.

And while Democrats had solid policies and economic plans, Republicans, backed by an army of digital content, were able to take the mantle of running on the economy and framing the left as cultural warriors out of touch with the majority of Americans.

But the good news is that this month’s elections in Virginia, New Jersey and New York City show Democrats have learned a lesson.

The three marquee campaigns of this year were all remarkably similar, despite coming from different parts of the ideological spectrum. Their messaging was relentlessly focused on affordability – how expensive and difficult life has become for the working and middle-class people of their communities. Their solutions covered a wide ideological range, but the focus remained the same.

Most young men, like most trans people and Black people and immigrants and everyone else, are dealing with housing that has skyrocketed in price, especially compared with our parents’ generations. Instead of having one career in our lifetimes, we now have to continually seek new jobs. Living independently as an adult is much more expensive and complicated now than it has been. These affordability campaigns gave young men something to do about those pressures rather than ceding that frustration to the most cynical actors.

Undoubtedly this conversation is easier to have when Donald Trump is taking three steps every day to dismantle the economy. There’s a real sense that the economy is getting worse. That it’s more difficult to pay bills and keep food on the table, especially when Republicans are, quite literally, ensuring that 42 million people cannot afford to keep food on their table by refusing to fund Snap during their government shutdown.

Republicans got distracted, trying to defend Trump and also trying to repeat his playbook of tying Democrats to the culture war of the moment. But without Trump’s singular ability to control a media narrative, Republicans with far less political talent and capital floundered, making themselves look weak and silly in the process.

The political miracle is that this ruthless focus on affordability and cost of living may have brought in many of those same young men who had followed Trump a year ago. In Virginia and New Jersey, men under 30 broke for their new Democratic governors, with about six in 10 supporting Spanberger, according to the AP. In New York, young men went for Zohran Mamdani over Andrew Cuomo by a margin of nearly 40 points, according to a Tufts Circle analysis.

It turns out that these young men are not completely lost to us. We just failed to imagine a reality where they could be in our camp.

Affordability broke through amid the longest government shutdown in US history, as consumer prices were rising ever higher thanks in part to Trump’s tariffs. For all of his bluster, eventually the economic reality becomes an unavoidable political crisis for anyone not far gone in his cult of personality who has to pay their bills.

Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey, Abigail Spanberger in Virginia, and Mamdani in New York City showed us that the frustration that every working and middle-class person feels could be directed into a political coalition that sees marginalized people as people also affected by the greed and corruption that has made life unaffordable for so many.

Young men, like everyone else, are looking for a politics that can make life a little better. Democrats are finally figuring out how to offer them that chance.",literal
"Olive harvest season is under way across the occupied West Bank.

In every Palestinian home, there is a ""teta"" - a grandmother and keeper of family traditions, who shares her recipes for using olives and tells stories of when the whole family gathered to harvest them.

The small green or black fruits are primarily used to produce oil, a staple never missing from a Palestinian dinner table, as well as table olives that accompany many meals.

In this visual explainer, Al Jazeera looks at what makes the olive so special to Palestinian identity and life.

Olive trees have been cultivated across Palestine for thousands of years, serving as a source of livelihood, cultural heritage and resilience.

The olive harvest, known as ""mawsim al-zaytoun"", begins in October, with preparations starting in September.

Families ready their tools as the first September rains, talat al-matar, soften the soil, wash the trees and, as many Palestinian proverbs say, bring ""barakeh"" (blessings) for the harvest and the year ahead.

More than 100,000 families rely on the harvest for their income. It runs through to November and brings together the entire community.

In the years before Israel's war on Gaza began in October 2023, almost half of all cultivated land across the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip was planted with an estimated 10 million olive trees.

Palestinians use olives predominantly for oil, but every part of the tree finds a purpose:

Olive oil - About 90 percent of olives are used to extract oil, with different regions of Palestine producing distinct varieties.

Table olives - Eaten fresh, pickled or seasoned, table olives are a central feature of Palestinian cuisine, festivals and hospitality.

Soap - The city of Nablus is famous for its olive oil soap, which is rich in antioxidants and gentle on the skin.

Wood crafts - Handcrafted olive wood items are made from pruned branches, fallen wood, or old trees that are no longer productive.",literal
"JERUSALEM — The U.S.- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, set up to distribute aid to Gaza as an alternative to the United Nations but which Palestinians said endangered the lives of civilians as they tried to get food, said Monday it would shutter operations.

The foundation had already closed distribution sites after a U.S.-brokered ceasefire took effect six weeks ago in Gaza. It announced Monday that it was permanently shutting down, claiming it had fulfilled its mission. “We have succeeded in our mission of showing there’s a better way to deliver aid to Gazans,” GHF director John Acree said in a statement.

The operations of the GHF were shrouded in secrecy during its short time in operation, and the group never revealed its sources of funding and said little about the armed contractors who operated the sites.

It said its goal was to deliver aid to Gaza without it being diverted by Hamas.

Palestinians, aid workers and health officials have said the system forced aid-seekers to risk their lives to reach the sites by passing Israeli troops who secured the locations. Soldiers often opened fire, killing hundreds, according to witnesses and videos posted to social media. The Israeli military says it only fired warning shots as a crowd-control measure or if its troops were in danger.

GHF said there was no violence in the aid sites themselves but acknowledged the potential dangers people faced when traveling to them on foot. However, contractors working at the sites, backed by video accounts, said the American security guards fired live ammunition and stun grenades as hungry Palestinians scrambled for food.

GHF shutters

Acree said that GHF would hand off its work to the U.S.-led center in Israel overseeing the Gaza ceasefire, called the Civil-Military Coordination Center.

“GHF has been in talks with CMCC and international organizations now for weeks about the way forward and it’s clear they will be adopting and expanding the model GHF piloted,” he said.

Tommy Pigott, a deputy spokesperson for the U.S. State Department, said on social platform X that GHF had “shared valuable lessons learned with us and our partners.”

GHF began operating in late May, nearly three months after Israel had halted food deliveries to Gaza, pushing the population toward famine.

Israel intended for the private contractor group to replace the U.N. food distribution system, claiming Hamas was diverting large amounts of aid. The U.N. denied the claims.

The U.N. had opposed the creation of GHF, saying the system gave Israel control over food distribution and could force the displacement of Palestinians. Throughout the war, the U.N. led a massive humanitarian effort with other aid groups, distributing food, medicine, fuel and other supplies at hundreds of centers around Gaza.

In the release, GHF said it had delivered over 3 million food boxes to Gaza, totaling 187 million meals.

Israel’s military chief and defense minister in rare public clash

On Monday, Israel’s defense minister clashed publicly with the military’s chief of staff over the army’s latest probes of its failures in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel by Palestinian militants that sparked the Israel-Hamas war.

Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz had said earlier that he would order a re-examination of the military’s latest internal review into what happened Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251 people to Gaza. He also said he would be freezing new appointments in the army pending the conclusions of this new review. Israel’s government has long resisted the establishment of a state commission of inquiry into the Oct. 7 attack.

In response, military Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir said in a sharply worded statement Monday that the defense minister’s move was “puzzling” and “not substantive.” He said that freezing appointments would harm the military’s “capabilities and its readiness for the upcoming challenges” and claimed he would continue to “hold posting discussions as planned, in accordance with his authority.”

The army “is the only body in the country that has thoroughly investigated its own failures and taken responsibility for them,” wrote Zamir. “If any further examination is required to complete the picture, it must take the form of an external, objective and independent commission” that will also probe “the interface between the military echelon and the political echelon.”

Moments after Zamir put out the statement, Katz doubled down on his decision, releasing a statement saying he “respects” the military chief of staff, “who knows very well that he is subordinate to the prime minister, the defense minister and the government of Israel.” He added he “does not intend to argue in the media” and reasserted his authority to decide on military appointments.

Following the military’s latest review, Zamir sanctioned 13 army officials who were top commanders on Oct. 7, censuring some and forcing others into retirement.

The attack kick-started the war in Gaza, in which over 69,700 Palestinians have been killed and over 170,800 injured, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry.

The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but has said women and children make up a majority of those killed. The ministry, part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals, maintains detailed records viewed as generally reliable by independent experts.

Israel says it kills wanted militant in West Bank

In the occupied West Bank, the Israeli military said it killed a militant wanted in a May 2024 car ramming attack that killed two Israeli soldiers in the northern city of Nablus.

The army said that the suspect, identified as Ala Raouf Shetiyya, was armed and barricaded himself inside a building before he was shot dead.

Israel has launched a military offensive in the West Bank since the Oct. 7 attacks in what it says is a crackdown against Palestinian militants. Tens of thousands of civilians have been displaced, and while many of the dead were militants, Palestinians and rights groups say scores of stone throwers and uninvolved civilians have been killed.",literal
"What books shaped you in high school? Here's what you said

Maansi Srivastava/NPR

This summer, we asked you to tell us about the books you read in high school that profoundly affected you. It turns out you had a lot to share. More than 1,100 of you wrote back to tell us about the formative texts you were assigned as teens.

You told us about books that broadened your perspectives and stuck with you as you got older. These dog-eared volumes got packed and unpacked every time you moved homes. They led you to become English majors, librarians, writers, teachers and editors. They inspired tattoos, pet names and baby names. Many of you shouted out the English teachers who, decades ago, pressed these texts into your hands, your heads and your hearts.

We're sharing your thoughts here. This list reflects a time when fewer female authors and writers of color were being published and assigned in high schools — and many of you expressed hope that today's syllabuses are more varied and diverse.

So, at the start of a new school year, with gratitude to English teachers past, present and future, here's what you told us about the books that shaped you.

Readers' responses have been lightly edited for length and clarity.

Two books came up far more often than any of the others:

To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee

Reading about racism from the perspective of a child — 6-year-old narrator Scout Finch in Harper Lee's Pulitzer Prize-winning 1960 novel — was an eye-opening experience for many who responded. Steve Kennebeck, 65, of Ranchos de Taos, N.M., was in seventh grade when his family moved from San Diego to Memphis, Tenn. ""Not long after I arrived, my English teacher, sensing I was having difficulty adjusting, asked how I was doing. … I told her I didn't like the humidity and that I didn't understand why all the Black kids seemed so angry. She reached for the bookshelf and handed me a copy of To Kill a Mockingbird and said: 'Read this — it will help you understand.'"" Christopher Anderson, 60, of Gloucester, Mass., felt such a connection to Scout's lawyer father that he named his first child Atticus. Nathaniel Hardman, 41, of Midvale, Utah, acknowledges: ""I know some object to the 'white savior' narrative. That's fine. Let that be part of the discussion.""

1984 by George Orwell

Whitney Todaro, 44, of Louisville, Colo., remembers being so upset by the ending of 1984 that she threw the book across the room. Many of you told us that George Orwell's dystopian novel encouraged you to think critically, question authority and be wary of state surveillance. There was a strong consensus that high schoolers should still be reading the book today. ""More important than ever — but retitle it to 2025,"" writes Thom Haynes, 65, of Apex, N.C.

The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger

Holden Caulfield gave voice to the angst and alienation many readers felt in their teen years. His disdain for ""phonies"" resonated with Jennifer Morrison, 56, of Buffalo, N.Y., and she admired the way Holden described his calling — catching kids at the edge of a rye field, just before a cliff. ""Much to my surprise, that's what I ended up doing for my career: I work at colleges, helping students who are failing, or who have failed out, to get back in the game. I love my work, which has never felt like work, and I owe it in part to Holden Caulfield,"" Morrison writes. Gene Kahane, 66, Alameda, Calif., remembers ""getting"" Holden as a teen — and he grew up to become a high school teacher himself. Kahane says now, more than ever, it's ""so powerful, so poignant, so real"" for young people to read stories about characters struggling with mental health. (And PS: Kahane now has a tattoo of a skate key on his forearm. IYKYK.)

Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury

Lauren Gradowski, 35, of Glen Burnie, Md., has taught Ray Bradbury's 1953 novel for a decade. It takes place in a future America where books are prohibited. ""With every passing year, I become more and more alarmed at how quickly our society has begun to mimic the dystopia it depicts,"" Gradowski writes. ""The book shows us how easily a society slips into apathy and contempt for critical thinking. … Our kids need to understand the risks, the price that we pay if we let this sort of world become normalized. … They already live in the early stages of Bradbury's dystopia. They at least deserve the chance to realize where things will end if they lean into it without question.""

The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck

""I never looked at a hot meal the same,"" says Colleen Johnson, 55, of Granbury, Texas. ""I vividly remember finishing a chapter about the starving families traveling to California, then sitting down to eat dinner with my family. I stared at my plate of food, so grateful for what I had."" John Steinbeck's 1939 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about tenant farmers in the Great Depression was a perspective shift for many of our readers. ""Class consciousness, baby,"" writes Eric Garneau, 41, of Chicago. ""That part of Steinbeck's story, although wildly obvious, somewhat glanced off me when I was younger — but, did it? Maybe it just burrowed itself into me, helping to foster empathy for migrants and the exploited even at an age when I could barely articulate what 'privilege' was."" We also got a lot of votes for East of Eden and Of Mice and Men.

"Consider being a young homeless person on benefits today. Those aged 16-24 who can’t live at home often end up in supported housing. This could be a shared flat or a hostel, where specialist staff are on hand to help. But such young people frequently have to cover service charges and bills – at an age when they should be building a future, not worrying about basic costs.

It’s good that the state steps in to support vulnerable young people. But wrong that it can undermine that help in practice. For the last eight years, campaigners have warned that young people in supported housing are penalised more harshly for earning than their non-homeless counterparts – and it’s a UK-wide problem. For every £1 these youngsters earn over their small earnings allowance, their housing benefit is reduced by 65p, compared with 55p for those in the private rental sector. Perversely, the flaw crept in during reforms meant to guarantee people on benefits were always better off in work.

Penalising young homeless people who want to work more is clearly counterintuitive. Anecdotally, those in the housing sector say it causes plenty of young people to forego meaningful work. You can see why: someone working 10 hours could lose more than £100 a month for picking up an 11th hour of work. That can narrow their options, as they find themselves having to be prescriptive about their hours, competing with peers who can be more flexible. In the longer run, it can reduce their prospects. In some cases, staff find themselves in the unenviable position of dissuading young people from taking a job lest they put their housing in jeopardy.

For a government that wants to “make work pay”, this can’t be right. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has a chance to fix the problem in the budget. Young people have been the worst affected by rising unemployment, and while Ms Reeves has made the right moves – promising paid work for young people on universal credit who haven’t found education or employment after 18 months – those plans remain sketchy. It surely makes sense for Ms Reeves to ensure that incentives to work apply equally to all young people.

A new campaign, fronted by 150 youth and homeless organisations, warns of a financial “cliff edge” that makes rent unaffordable and increases the risk of arrears. Charities say the earnings allowance should rise from a token £5 to about £57, and the housing benefit taper should be brought down from 65% to 55% to match universal credit.

These are sensible, practical measures that would ensure that some of the country’s poorest people get financial help. It would also signal that the government is invested in making the country fairer for them. The homeless charity Centrepoint says it’s a win-win policy. The Treasury, it calculates, will gain £5m a year as more young people move into work. Once wider outcomes – such as improved health and reduced crime – are considered, the net gain is £13m annually.

There is a generational crisis bubbling under Britain’s surface in which young people face rising unemployment, insecure housing and falling real wages. Their futures, it feels, are being shaped less by opportunity and more by precarity. If ministers truly want to “make work pay” for everyone, they’ll have to explain why 30,000 young homeless people are the one group excluded from that promise. It’s time to act.",literal

"Opinion: Why I'm handing in my Pentagon press pass

toggle caption Andrew Harnik/Getty Images

Today, NPR will lose access to the Pentagon because we will not sign an unprecedented Defense Department document, which warns that journalists may lose their press credentials for ""soliciting"" even unclassified information from federal employees that has not been officially approved for release. That policy prevents us from doing our job. Signing that document would make us stenographers parroting press releases, not watchdogs holding government officials accountable.



No reputable news organization signed the new rule — not mainstream outlets like NPR, The Washington Post, CNN, and The New York Times, nor the conservative Washington Times or the right-wing Newsmax, run by a noted ally of President Trump. Some 100 resident Pentagon press will be barred from the building if they don't sign by the end of business on Tuesday.



I've held my Pentagon press pass for 28 years. For most of that time, when I wasn't overseas in combat zones embedding with troops, I walked the halls, talking to and getting to know officers from all over the globe, at times visiting them in their offices.

Sponsor Message

Did I as a reporter solicit information? Of course. It's called journalism: finding out what's really going on behind the scenes and not accepting wholesale what any government or administration says.

I remember how then-Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld was ecstatic after the fall of Baghdad in 2003, insisting that it showed the success of the U.S. invasion. Not long after, I ran into an officer at the Pentagon who told me, ""No, Tom. It's not a success. Saddam Hussein's supporters are attacking our supply lines. Now, we have to send more troops back to guard them."" That was because the United States, at Rumsfeld's insistence, never sent an adequate number of forces to Iraq to begin with — a fact another Army general warned me about, unsolicited — and I reported on, before the war even began.



Instead of toeing the official line, that reporting helped people understand what U.S. troops were really facing. Far from being a success, the fall of Baghdad marked the beginning of an insurgency that stretched on for years.

(Defense Department officials, by the way, have already restricted reporter movements in the Pentagon. They closed that particular hallway to reporters several months ago.)



In 2009, when the Obama administration announced a ""surge"" of State Department employees to Afghanistan to help the military keep the peace in restive, far-flung provinces, one Marine officer told me months later: ""If there was a surge, we never saw it."" And when the administration touted an Afghan ""government in a box,"" to bring experienced Afghans to the provinces, it proved to be a failure. One general told me: ""Next time they tell you there's a government in a box, check the box.""



Again, I reported both stories. That's my job.



Over the years, to be able to inform the public and hold the government to account for the wars being waged in Iraq and Afghanistan and the fight against the Islamic State in Syria, NPR reporters, producers, photographers and I have spent a lot of time in combat zones.

We got to know soldiers and Marines over the years while embedding with them, talking with them and getting their perspective, which was often far different from what we were told officially at the Pentagon. Sometimes officials at the Pentagon would declare progress or success. Out in dusty combat outposts or on patrols, we would learn the truth was far more complicated. I'm still in touch with many of those soldiers and Marines we met long ago. I'm having a beer with one of them the end of this week. They want the truth to get out, too.



In June 2016, U.S. officials were insisting that Afghan troops were making progress against the Taliban. I was part of a team of NPR reporters that embedded with Afghan forces to find out if that official line was indeed true, trying to get the ground truth about what had become America's longest war. We were travelling in an Afghan convoy in western Afghanistan when we were ambushed. I lost two friends and NPR lost two brave colleagues, photographer David Gilkey and translator Zabihullah Tamanna, that day. Producer and colleague Monika Evstatieva and I were in that convoy, took small arms fire, but were unharmed.



When we flew by helicopter to bring David and Zabi's bodies to a nearby American base, the U.S. general there ordered an honor cordon, a tribute that is usually reserved for fallen troops, not civilians from the United States and Afghanistan. Out of respect for two people who'd lost their lives in their line of duty, doing their jobs documenting the truth as journalists, U.S. soldiers lined up in the darkness on either side as David and Zabi were carried off the helicopter. I fought hard not to weep at one of the most decent, humane, and heartfelt gestures I've ever seen.

In NPR's lobby, there's a memorial to David and Zabi, including one of the cameras David was carrying that day, scorched and damaged.



So yes, we've received solicited and unsolicited information on everything from failed policies and botched military operations that led to unnecessary military and civilian deaths, to wasteful government projects that both Democratic and Republicans administrations would rather stay in the shadows.



That's our job.



Now, we're barely getting any information at all from the Pentagon. In the 10 months that the Trump administration has been in office, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has given just two briefings.

Sponsor Message

And there have been virtually no background briefings, which were common in the past whenever there has been military action anywhere in the world, as there has been with the recent bombings of Iran's nuclear facilities and of boats off the coast of Venezuela alleged to be carrying illicit drugs. In previous administrations, Defense Department officials — including the acerbic Rumsfeld — would hold regular press briefings, often twice a week. They knew the American people deserved to know what was going on.



Thomas Jefferson, no fan of the press himself, once wrote that our liberty depends on the freedom of the press, ""and that cannot be limited without being lost."" He knew a free and fair press is an essential safeguard to a functioning democracy.



So now, how will the American people find out what is being done at the Pentagon in their name, with their hard-earned tax dollars, and more importantly, the decisions that may put their sons and daughters in harm's way? With no reporters able to ask questions, it seems the Pentagon leadership will continue to rely on slick social media posts, carefully orchestrated short videos and interviews with partisan commentators and podcasters.



No one should think that's good enough.

"I volunteered in Gaza as a doctor. The anger, guilt, and helplessness I continue to feel are unbearable.

It has been more than a month since a “ceasefire” took hold in Gaza. That, of course, does not mean that the killing of Palestinians has stopped. It simply means that it has been reduced to a rate that allows international media to ignore it.

And so, the world has largely moved on from the story. But I haven’t.

In July 2024, I joined a medical mission to Gaza and spent 22 days there, volunteering at hospitals. What I came back with is something I cannot easily explain.

The man my family knew, the son, brother, and husband they laughed with, the father who played with his children, feels lost to them now.

I call him the “previous Talal”.

My children, wife, siblings, parents, friends and colleagues, they all see the change. They tell me I have become distant, quiet, detached, and sometimes hard to reach. My emotions are messy and raw in ways words often fail to capture. It is not a single feeling, but a swarm of emotions that is not going away despite the news of a “ceasefire” and reassurances of “reconstruction”.

After witnessing human tragedy of indescribable proportions, I still feel anger bubbling at the injustice of it all, guilt for leaving behind the vulnerable, and a constant, aching helplessness at not being able to do something to stop this continuing annihilation.

I still feel uneasy when I see a lavish buffet meal on a table in front of me, knowing people continue to starve in Gaza.

The faces and scenes I have witnessed continue playing like a never-ending movie in my head: Starving children reduced to skeletons, parents who held onto body parts of their beloved children, completely charred humans, cozy blankets used as shrouds for human body parts, a bombed hospital, levelled buildings emitting the odour of decomposing bodies buried in their rubble.

Advertisement

I am still haunted by the choices I had to make: which patient to treat because there were not enough dialysis machines, or what words to use to explain to a child why their parent will not wake up.

Gaza has transformed me from a nephrologist to a journalist, storyteller, and humanitarian. Since I came back, I have written articles, spoken at mosques and universities, led talks at fundraisers, stood at marches, and met lawmakers, advocating for the oppressed people of Gaza in every way I can. Just like other colleagues who have been on medical missions to the Gaza Strip, I have tried to turn bearing witness into action so that Gaza is not forgotten.

I have tried to go back several times. Each time, Israel has denied me entry. Each denial has made my heart ache worse.

The distance between what I can do here and what is needed there feels unbearable. I constantly ask myself, “Am I doing enough? Have I failed?”

Is this sadness? Trauma? A conscience that refuses to be at peace? I do not know the proper label, and labels do not lessen the load.

What I do know is this: Gaza changed me in a way that cannot be undone, and to pretend otherwise would be a betrayal of what I saw and of the people I met.

The previous Talal is lost, but this new Talal is more humane, kind, compassionate, more realistic, more courageous and vocal, driven by the resilience and faith of the people of Gaza.

No medical training could prepare me to maintain a “life-genocide balance”.

Still, the despair and pain I carry now are only a pinch of what the Palestinians have endured day after day, for more than two years now. They have experienced unimaginable horrors, torture, starvation, injury and death.

If you read my story, please read not to offer sympathy but to remember: The genocide in Gaza is not over, and the besieged people of Gaza are still suffering. Behind every statistic in Gaza, there are human souls, ambitions, hopes and dignity.

The ceasefire is a temporary relief from the mass bombardment; true peace will come only when the occupation ends and justice is served.

As I share my emotions and experiences in Gaza, I am also heartbroken about what is happening in Sudan. It feels like watching a tragic replay of suffering and loss, human devastation livestreamed every day.

What troubles me even more is how easily the world seems to be getting used to it. This realisation is harrowing. Human civilisation has achieved so much in terms of progress and development, yet we seem to be regressing when it comes to compassion and humanity.

Advertisement

I write these words to call on people to take action.

To my fellow healthcare workers and humanitarians who have volunteered in Gaza, I say: we cannot let the world turn its back. We must not stop speaking about what we witnessed and what continues to happen in Gaza. We must continue to inform, rally and insist that full humanitarian and medical access to Gaza is granted.

To my fellow Americans, I say, we bear responsibility for what is happening in Gaza. Our country is directly involved in it, our taxpayers’ money is funding it. Do not stay silent because of intimidation. Speak, write, post and talk about it in your communities. Call your lawmakers. Do not allow the mass bombardment, torture and starvation of another people to be normalised.

And to all people of the world who still believe in the possibility of a free and just world, I say: the responsibility is ours to make sure it is. We have witnessed a livestreamed genocide, one of the greatest moral tests of our time. So do not fall into silence. Rise. Refuse to let a temporary ceasefire in Gaza or a protracted war in Sudan become a curtain that hides the genocidal reality. Keep insisting on an end to the violence, for the dignity of every human life.

Let us be the force that helps Gaza and Sudan heal, rebuild and remember, so that “never again” becomes “never again for all”!

"Donald Glover revealed he suffered a stroke last year during a concert tour as his musical alter ego Childish Gambino.

“I had a really bad pain in my head in Louisiana and I did the show anyway,” Glover, 42, told a concert crowd during a Nov. 22 performance at the musical festival Camp Flog Gnaw, per videos shared on social media.

After the tour moved to Houston, he said he went to a hospital.

“The doctor was like, ‘You had a stroke,’” he said.

“The first thing I thought was like, ‘Oh, here I am still copying Jamie Foxx,’” he joked, referring to the stroke the “Ray” star suffered in April 2023 that left him hospitalized for weeks.

“That’s really like the second thing. The first thing was like, ‘I’m letting everybody down,’” Glover continued.

He said doctors went on to find “a hole in my heart,” leading to him having two surgeries.

He then reflected on what his health scare has taught him while speaking with the crowd.

“They say everybody has two lives and the second life starts when you realize you have one. You’ve got one life, guys and I gotta be honest. The life I’ve lived with you guys has been such a blessing. I love seeing and performing for you guys,” he said. “As my wife says, which I love, she says, if this life is a flavor, soon as I’m done give me another scoop.”

“You should be living your life how you want because it can only get better,” Glover concluded. “If we have to do this again, it can only get better.”

"NEW DELHI — Dharmendra, one of Indian cinema’s most popular stars whose versatile performances made him a defining screen presence of 1970s and 1980s Bollywood films, died Monday.

He was 89.

The actor, who would have turned 90 on Dec. 8, had been in and out of a hospital in the financial capital, Mumbai, over the past few weeks.

A senior police official who had spoken with Dharmendra’s doctor confirmed the death on the condition of anonymity.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered his condolences, saying the actor’s death marks the end of an era in Indian cinema.

“He was an iconic film personality, a phenomenal actor who brought charm and depth to every role he played. The manner in which he played diverse roles struck a chord with countless people,” Modi said on the social media platform X.

Often called Bollywood’s “he-man,” Dharmendra combined the old-school heroism of an action star with the tenderness of a romantic lead, making him one of India’s most iconic actors. Though most of his fame came from roles in which he embodied the archetype of a larger-than-life hero — upright, patriotic and fearless — his charming performances in romantic hits equally made him popular with the masses.

Dharmendra’s performance in “Sholay” (1975) — Bollywood’s take on the Spaghetti Western and regarded as one of India’s greatest films — earned him enduring popularity. His roles in other Hindi-language hits, from the romantic comedy “Chupke Chupke” (1975) to the action drama “Mera Gaon Mera Desh” (1971), made him one of the most recognizable film faces from that era.

His role in Bollywood classic “Sholay,” in which he played an affable character alongside Amitabh Bachchan, his co-actor in the film, cemented his status as a superstar. The duo’s on-screen partnership also became one of Bollywood’s most iconic pairings.

His on-screen chemistry with actress Hema Malini, whom he later married, became one of Bollywood’s most popular collaborations, as the pair acted together in more than two dozen films. But their union was rooted in scandal. Dharmendra had married Prakash Kaur before his film debut, and went on to have four children with her, including two who would follow in his acting footsteps — Sunny Deol and Bobby Deol.

Despite his marriage to Malini in 1980, he reportedly never divorced Kaur and continued to live with her. According to local media reports, he briefly converted to Islam before marrying Malini as Indian law disallows Hindus to marry twice, especially if their spouse is alive.

Dharmendra and Malini had two daughters, including Bollywood actor Esha Deol. His nephew, Abhay Deol, also joined the industry.

Later in his career, Dharmendra moved to more character-driven roles, frequently portraying paternal figures in the 1990s and 2000s in a career that continued through 2025. He was last seen in war biopic film “Ikkis.”

“I never thought I would come this far,” he said in a 2021 interview with Indian news website Rediff.

Born Dharmendra Kewal Krishan Deol in India’s northern state of Punjab in 1935, he grew up in a farming family and moved to Mumbai in the late 1950s, making his Bollywood debut in 1960. Over a career spanning six decades, he acted in more than 300 films.

In 2012, Dharmendra was awarded the Padma Bhushan, India’s third-highest civilian honor, in recognition of his contribution to Indian cinema. He also briefly turned to politics, serving as a Bharatiya Janata Party lawmaker in Parliament from 2004 to 2009, though his political stint was short-lived.

"The woman convicted of brutally stabbing her sixth-grade classmate to please the fictional horror character ""Slender Man"" was apprehended in Illinois after having left her Wisconsin group home with a 43-year-old man, officials said.

Morgan Geyser, 23, cut off her Department of Corrections monitoring bracelet and left the group home Saturday night, the Madison Police Department said.

Police said they were notified at 10:34 p.m. Sunday that Geyser was taken into custody in Illinois. The Posen Police Department said officers were dispatched to Thornton's Truck Stop for a report of a man and a woman ""loitering behind the building.""

When officers arrived, they found people sleeping on the sidewalk, Posen police said.

""The female repeatedly refused to provide her real name and initially gave a false one,"" Posen police said in a statement. ""After continued attempts to identify her, she finally stated that she didn’t want to tell officers who she was because she had 'done something really bad,' and suggested that officers could 'just Google' her name.""

Once she provided her true identity, however, police confirmed she was Geyser. Posen police said in a statement that the man with Geyser was also taken into custody.

A police report identified the man with Geyser as Chad Mecca, 43, who did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It's unclear whether he has an attorney.

According to the report, Geyser told officers that she felt she was treated unfairly at her group home and that she was ""upset that Chad was not allowed to visit her."" She added that the man had snuck in through her window on multiple occasions to see her at the group home.

""When asked about her ankle monitor she stated that she cut it off with scissors and that she and Chad discussed potentially making their way to Nashville, Tennessee,"" the report said.

Geyser appeared in court Monday and was ordered to be detained at the Cook County Jail. The Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office said in a statement that an out-of-state warrant from Wisconsin was executed, and her next court date is Tuesday in Chicago.

Waukesha County District Attorney Lesli Boese told reporters that her office does not have jurisdiction in Geyser’s case as her group home is in a different county. The decision to charge Geyser in relation with the escape would fall to officials in Dane County, according to Boese.

Dane County District Attorney’s Ismael R. Ozanne told NBC News that the case is still under investigation by the Madison Police Department and has not yet been referred to his office.

A petition to revoke Geyser's conditional release in light of recent events would have to be filed by the state, which Boese said her office ""fully"" supports. Geyser would be returned to full-time institutionalized care if her release were to be revoked.

""Not only should she have been in custody from 2014 forward, but also, attorney [Abbey] Nickolie argued vehemently for her not to be released to conditional release in I believe it was January of this year,"" Boese told reporters.

Wisconsin's Department of Health Services noted that Geyser is considered a patient and therefore protected by patient privacy laws, limiting its ability to comment on her case. The Department of Corrections is similarly limited, it added.

In an update earlier Sunday night, police included a tentative timeline covering Geyser's departure. The department said it was not notified of Geyser’s status until officers were dispatched to the group home Sunday morning based on a 911 call.

About 8:15 p.m. Saturday: Geyser was last seen at the group home.

Someone from the home called 911 to report Geyser had vanished, characterizing her as a missing person. 7:58 a.m.: Madison police were sent to investigate the missing person report.

The dispatch was ""the first time the Madison Police Department was made aware that Geyser was missing,” the police department said.

The police department also said it did not receive the Department of Corrections' request for law enforcement to apprehend Geyser.

A judge ruled in January that Geyser should be released from a psychiatric hospital. She had spent nearly seven years in the Winnebago Mental Health Institute and was then moved to a group home.

Geyser was 15 when she was sentenced to a maximum of 40 years in a mental hospital for the 2014 stabbing attack. She and another girl lured their classmate Payton Leutner to a suburban Milwaukee park and attacked the girl, with Geyser stabbing her.

At the time, all three girls were 12 years old, and the victim barely survived.

Geyser and her classmate believed they had to attack the victim or risk having Slender Man, the fictional boogeyman, come after their families, defense lawyers said at the time.

Anthony Cotton, Geyser's attorney, shared a video statement Sunday on social media urging Geyser to turn herself in.

""We just heard the news that Morgan has walked away from the group home that she was housed at. Obviously it’s in her best interest to turn herself in immediately and not continue with this course of action,"" he said. ""If anybody has contact with Morgan, hears from her, or if Morgan happens to see this, turn yourself in. Do not continue to remain on the run like this.""

Leutner’s family said they were aware of Geyser’s disappearance.

“Payton and her family are safe and are working closely with local law enforcement to ensure their continued safety. The family would like to thank all of the law enforcement entities involved in the efforts to apprehend Morgan,” the statement said. “The Leutner family also wish to thank the outpouring of support from family, friends, and well-wishers who have contacted them during this difficult time.”

Police did not give more information about the group home Geyser left. The Department of Corrections has multiple programs for post-prison rehabilitation, drug treatment and supervision of those ""conditionally released from mental health facilities,"" according to the website for the department's Division of Community Corrections.",figurative
"First it was mechanisation threatening our jobs, then AI and now this: the Great Feminisation is taking over the workplace. Well, that’s according to American journalist Helen Andrews, who popularised this thesis in a speech to the National Conservatism conference in Washington DC.

The idea is that too many women in the workplace, and in positions of power, has led to the dominance of stereotypical feminine values, to the detriment of everyone. Girly things like conflict resolution rather than manly plain speaking, fussy HR departments, or a lack of healthy aggressive competition, have all created an imbalance in the workplace and in the world, suppressing stereotypical masculine values. Andrews fears for her sons and their future in the feminised world that she believes threatens us all.

The thesis makes two fundamental errors. First, stereotypes attached to femininity don’t represent all women, any more than stereotypes about masculinity define all men. Second, nobody needs a feminised world, whatever that nonsense even means, but we all need a feminist world. There’s a big difference.

For centuries, it was policy to keep women out of education and most professions, although women have, of course, always worked – in agriculture, in factories, or in service to rich people. Much of this was not in the formal economy, it was cash in hand. Work like childcare, washing or sewing was done at home, rather than in the public sphere. Yet work has always been gendered as masculine, because formal, paid employment outside the home has been seen as the preserve of men. So work comes to define masculinity, and therefore men, being viewed as core to men’s identity.

It is not only conservatives making these kinds of arguments. Scott Galloway, an American academic and author of a much-discussed new book, Notes on Being a Man, has summarised masculinity thus: “getting up at fucking six in the morning and going to work and doing shitty work such that you can protect your family economically”. In his book, he links falling wages and unemployment rates with a crisis in masculinity, and in men’s sense of identity. While he doesn’t argue for women’s removal from the workplace, he does frame these issues – that affect everyone, across the labour market – as male concerns.

The real problem facing men is that, like femininity, masculinity is still defined by backward stereotypes about what men should be. These stereotypes – including visible signifiers of financial success, respect and seniority in the workplace and public sphere – have always been put out of reach for many men, and perhaps now for most. A new report, The State of UK Men, from Beyond Equality, revealed that 88% of the men surveyed believed that being a man means providing financially for your family – and just over half felt it was more important that men, rather than women, were the breadwinners. However, 40% reported that their income was not enough to meet their daily needs, and more than half constantly worried about their financial future.

Women face these same economic challenges. The same survey found that equal numbers of men and women lack any sense of purpose or meaning in their life. The gender pay gap in the UK is around 13% across all employees and women are still more likely than men to be in part-time work, traditionally lower paid. Women are also more likely to be heads of households and raising children; they are what charities such as the Women’s Budget Group call the main “shock absorbers” of poverty.

The violence of poverty affects everyone, yet society responds with peculiar sympathy and grief when men face barriers to success in the arenas we have picked out to define their worth. This is what I call the masculinity burden. Attacks on men’s income, employment or job security are viewed not only as challenging in a human way, as they would be for anyone, but doubly challenging because they are portrayed as attacks on, and affronts to, masculinity itself. From this perspective, it is not that 50% of the experiences of precarity – women’s – are not seen; it’s that they are just not seen as being as bad for women, because women don’t carry this extra burden of masculinity.

The gendered effects of life experiences, such as redundancy or low pay, are clearly real. The State of UK Men finds that work and stable finances are still very much classed as the measure of men’s worth, leading to failure feeling like an existential threat. This is the pain and shame of not meeting gendered expectations. Women are no strangers to this either, in the ceaseless pressure of beauty standards attached to femininity, the presumption of motherhood and judgments about mothering, or in status being attached to male partners. The expectations can be different, but it’s the gendered rules that are the problem, rigging the game for us all, setting us up for failure in one area or another.

What men need to succeed in the workplace has nothing to do with the numbers of women employed – it has to do with job security, livable wages, affordable rents, reliable sick pay and flexible work around parenting and caring. This is what men say they want, too: one of the many positives from the report is that 83% of men believe in sharing housework and care with their partner, and 80% want practical support to help fathers be more present in family life. These policies would help everyone – not just at work, but out in the world, because all of us have human needs to give and receive love and care in our families and communities. If you want to call that feminised, then so be it. I call it feminist.",literal
"Former Sen. Doug Jones announced Monday that he has filed paperwork to run for governor of Alabama, setting the stage for a potential rematch with Republican Sen. Tommy Tuberville.

Jones announced his candidacy in a video on social media, saying he would officially kick off his campaign after the Thanksgiving holiday.

""In the meantime, what I know and what we have heard all along is Alabama wants their next governor to be someone who lives here, who works here, who listens to the people of this state, who understands the people of this state,"" Jones said in the video.

Gov. Kay Ivey, a Republican, cannot run again because of term limits.

Jones also made a thinly veiled reference to Tuberville, the top Republican candidate in the race, saying Alabamians are looking for a governor who ""treats this state with grace and dignity and not just like a rest stop on the way to the Florida beach.""

Tuberville, who launched his run for governor in May, has been dogged by questions about his residency in past campaigns amid revelations that he voted and owned property in Florida. Tuberville has insisted he is a full-time Alabama resident.

Tuberville, a former Auburn University football coach, defeated Jones by 20 percentage points in 2020, when Jones ran for a full Senate term. Jones, a former U.S. attorney, won a 2017 special Senate election in the deeply Republican state against former state Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore, who faced allegations of sexual misconduct with underage girls. Moore denied the allegations.

Jones is the latest Democrat to join the primary field, which includes educator Yolanda Flowers, who lost to Ivey by 38 points in 2022.

The race will be an uphill climb for any Democrat in the solidly Republican state. Tuberville has also been building up his campaign coffers, having ended October with $6.2 million in his campaign account, according to recent fundraising reports.",literal
"Chip Kelly’s time in the NFL has ended. Again.

The Raiders announced that they have parted ways with their first-year offensive coordinator.

“I spoke with Chip Kelly earlier this evening and informed him of his release as offensive coordinator of the Raiders,” coach Pete Carroll said a press release. “I would like to thank Chip for his service and wish him all the best in the future.”

Kelly, hired as part of Pete Carroll’s staff after spending 2024 with Ohio State, was the highest-paid coordinator in the NFL, reportedly at $6 million per year.

An interim coordinator has not yet been identified.

Kelly went from a successful run as head coach at Oregon to the Eagles in 2013. He was fired after three seasons, and he was one-and-done as head coach of the 49ers.

From 2018 through 2023 he was the head coach at UCLA. His job with the Raiders was his first NFL stint as a coordinator.

It had seemed for weeks as if Carroll and Kelly could not co-exist over the long term. As it turned out, they couldn’t co-exist in the short term.

Whatever the Raiders do next, it likely won’t change their eventual fate for the season. They’re currently 2-9. And the overriding question is whether Carroll, who has lost five games in a row for only the second time in his 28-year career as a pro and college coach, will be back in 2026.",literal
"Europe’s leaders cannot stop talking about democracy. President Emmanuel Macron says he wants to kickstart a democratic “resurgence”, and Friedrich Merz, the German chancellor, has warned of an “axis” of autocratic states targeting liberal democracy in Europe. Having promised to “fight” for what she calls European “values”, Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, has just announced a new “democracy shield” and a Centre for Democratic Resilience to prevent foreign interference and deal with external threats. I keep hoping for similar scrutiny of democratic backsliding within the EU – but so far it has not happened.

Foreign interference, disinformation and the creeping illiberalism of Hungary, Poland and Slovakia deserve attention. But lost in this fretting is a more inconvenient truth: within Europe’s “mature” democracies, there is a steady corrosion of the rule of law, a degradation of political discourse and the normalisation of racism, xenophobia and discrimination.

Growing up in a country where democracy was fragile and frequently interrupted, I learned early that the issue is not merely about elections. It is about the quality of governance and of politicians. It depends on protecting human rights and dignity, ensuring social justice, respecting minorities – and minority views – and creating a genuine sense of belonging for all citizens.

That is why I am troubled when EU governments and political elites undermine the rule of law, constrain free speech, normalise police violence and ignore signs that racism and xenophobia have seeped into public life. Across the bloc, the demonisation of racialised refugees and migrants has become common. Ironically, even as they champion democratic renewal, Merz, Macron and von der Leyen are chipping away at the very values they claim to defend.

When Merz urged journalists to “ask your daughters” about why Germany’s changing “cityscape” threatens their security, he did more than infantilise German women. He activated toxic colonial and orientalist tropes of Black and brown men as violent, hypersexual, uncivilised aggressors, as bodies to be policed, controlled and deported. Though he later acknowledged migrants’ economic contributions, the damage was done. Merz moved Germany’s Overton window on what is considered acceptable in political discourse, thereby giving more oxygen to the far right.

In France, too, Macron’s legacy will be marked not only by his attempts at liberal reforms but by his legitimisation of far-right narratives. By echoing Marine Le Pen’s rhetoric on national identity, Islam and migration, Macron has normalised what was once unsayable for centrists. The far-right National Rally now stands as a respectable government-in-waiting precisely because the so-called liberal centre helped embed its ideas in the mainstream.

A similar dynamic is playing out within EU institutions. Italy’s Giorgia Meloni may have set the shameful example by outsourcing the processing of asylum seekers to Albania, but it is the European Commission that has incorporated deportation as a legitimate policy tool in the EU’s new migration pact – and von der Leyen who keeps signing migration-deterrence deals with regimes such as those in Tunisia and Egypt that are accused of abuse and torture.

Israel’s genocide in Gaza has laid bare the many ways in which the EU is in violation of its own norms and principles, as well as in flagrant breach of its obligations under international law to prevent and punish genocide. In Germany, police forces have been condemned by UN experts for criminalising and suppressing legitimate Palestinian solidarity activism. In Belgium, the use of teargas, batons and water cannon against peaceful protesters outside the European parliament prompted calls for an investigation from Amnesty International. EU institutions are quick to condemn state violence in other parts of the world, but are silent when it occurs within their own borders.

After every European election, we reassure ourselves that the “centre is holding”. The reality is that whether in national governments or in the European parliament, far-right parties are increasingly shaping the European agenda. The conservative European People’s party has grown ever-more comfortable forming majorities with far-right groups, especially on environmental policy. Politicians across Europe are adopting far-right talking points on migration and Muslims. The excuse is always that this is being done to contain the hardliners, even though studies consistently show that such mimicry amplifies and normalises extremism.

Still, there are glimmers of hope. Spain’s Pedro Sánchez has shown moral clarity on Gaza and adopted a national migration policy which is rooted in dignity and solidarity. In the Netherlands, Rob Jetten of the centre-left D66, expected to lead a new coalition, ran on a platform of hope rather than hate and spoke out against Israel’s genocide. The UK Green party’s Zack Polanski and Ireland’s new president Catherine Connolly are helping to revive a progressive political discourse in their countries. And across the Atlantic, New York’s new mayor, Zohran Mamdani, a proud son of immigrants and unapologetic advocate for justice, housing and solidarity, has demonstrated that democracy’s vitality depends on moral courage and inclusive coalitions – and that racial and religious identity can be a source of pride.

European leaders should take note that, even as the EU arms itself with a “democracy shield”, strengthening democratic resilience is not only about fighting external threats, adversaries and disinformation. It is also about building inclusive democracy at home, dismantling racism, ensuring equality and creating a sense of belonging for all European citizens.",figurative

The annual Latin Grammy awards are always full of glamour and glitz. But they're also an ideal time to take the pulse of the industry — which is exactly what Anamaria Sayre did this year, perusing the red carpet to talk with the most exciting names in Latin music.

In this episode, Ana brings Felix her report from Las Vegas, where Bad Bunny won Album of the Year, the independent Brazilian music scene made a splash, and the whole industry seemed to be saying: ""Show us where you're from.""

"This year's lethal spread of measles in rural West Texas and other pockets of the U.S. was a strong warning about how protection against deadly childhood diseases is eroding around the nation.

This was a key conclusion of a six-month NBC News investigation, in collaboration with Stanford University, resulting in the most comprehensive analysis of vaccinations and school exemptions to date.

NBC News gathered massive amounts of data from state governments and archives of public records reaching back years or decades. With the help of infectious disease researchers at Stanford, NBC News filed scores of requests for documents, including materials obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, and wrestled different types of data into a standardized format to map and compare rates across thousands of counties.

The analysis found that a large swath of the U.S. currently does not have the basic, ground-level immunity medical experts believe is necessary to stop the spread of measles, which had once receded into the past.

NBC News data investigation: How progress against childhood diseases is backsliding. The Vaccine Divide: Much of the U.S. currently doesn't have the protection needed to prevent outbreaks, the monthslong investigation reveals. One key finding of the analysis is stunning.

St. Louis offers a window into the overwhelming problem communities face nationwide.

How protected is your community? Search for current vaccination exemption rates in thousands of counties across the U.S. and see how the numbers have changed over time.

The idea for this project originated from a conversation about how to cover changes in vaccine policy and opinion between the NBC News Health and Medical unit and Dr. Peter Hotez, a vaccine expert and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Dallas.

The conversation led to infectious diseases scientist Dr. Nathan Lo at Stanford University, who had mapped out vaccination and exemption data in a few states. Lo became a collaborator in this monthslong data project, helping identify the limitations of the broader state-level vaccination trends that are collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Outbreaks start locally

We put vaccination trends under a microscope, down to the county level. The findings could help public health officials better predict where the next outbreak may occur and how to best allocate resources to stop it.

Or parents of children at high risk of complications from infectious diseases could find out if their community is a potential hot spot.

The analysis has identified unexpected trends.

For example, St. Louis, a diverse, major metropolitan area, is in the midst of a slide in immunization rates. That’s why it is a reporting focus.

These findings uncover a fracture in an already fragmented society: The vaccine divide.

Our Methodology

How NBC News collected the data

NBC News built a database of kindergarten vaccination and exemption information using data provided by state governments, primarily health agencies. The data combines public information available for some states and data provided directly to NBC News.

The data covers kindergartner vaccinations for each academic year.

After collection, the data was collated and exemption rates were calculated in order to be analyzed. The analysis focuses on four facets of the data:

Medical exemptions: Exemptions granted when students have a medical condition that would make vaccination potentially harmful. Nonmedical exemptions: Exemptions for students who opt out of required vaccinations due to personal beliefs or religious convictions. MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) vaccinations: For states in which data is subdivided by number of doses, MMR vaccination is counted by the second dose. Up-to-date vaccinations: Students are considered “up-to-date” with their vaccinations if they have received the full vaccination series required for enrollment in their school.

How the data was processed

With a hodgepodge of formats, jurisdictions and collection practices across states, the task required extensive work to ensure that possible inconsistencies in the data were managed.

Certain states, such as Ohio and New York, required further calculations to aggregate the state-supplied data.

Other states required hand input of hundreds of rows of tabular data.

All data was checked for accuracy.

Analyzing the data

Each state collects its data differently. Some use health districts instead of counties. Some states provided over a decade of data, others only two years. Some states redacted certain data due to privacy concerns.",literal
"Novo Nordisk said on Monday an older oral version of its semaglutide drug failed to meet its main goal in late-stage trials testing whether the medicine can slow cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s patients, sending its share price down 10%.

The setback is a blow to hopes that Alzheimer’s could open a major new market for GLP-1 medicines such as semaglutide, as Novo faces rising competition to its blockbuster drugs in its core treatment areas of obesity and diabetes.

Alzheimer’s patients currently have limited treatment options. Novo's trial was being closely watched as an indication about whether GLP-1 drugs — used by millions for diabetes and weight loss — might slow disease progress.

The drug tested was Rybelsus, a pill approved only for type 2 diabetes. Like Novo’s blockbusters Ozempic and Wegovy, it contains semaglutide.

‘Lottery ticket’ fails to win

The company’s Executive Vice President for Product and Portfolio Strategy, Ludovic Helfgott, had described the Alzheimer’s trials as a “lottery ticket” in September, a reference to its uncertain prospects yet huge potential.

Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias affect more than 55 million people globally. There is no cure.

“While semaglutide did not demonstrate efficacy in slowing the progression of Alzheimer’s disease, the extensive body of evidence supporting semaglutide continues to provide benefits for individuals with Type 2 diabetes, obesity, and related comorbidities,” Chief Scientific Officer Martin Holst Lange said in a statement.

The results from the two trials of early-stage patients, called EVOKE and EVOKE+, are another setback for the Danish drugmaker and new CEO Mike Doustdar, which had seen booming success, driven by Ozempic and Wegovy, before slowing sales growth and a tumbling share price prompted a CEO change and mass layoffs.

The setback reinforces analyst skepticism about Novo‘s Alzheimer’s ambitions, with UBS having estimated just a 10% probability of success.

Participants aged 55 to 85

The trials, covering a combined 3,808 patients, were the first large trials for patients with early stage Alzheimer’s and Rybelsus.

The trials used a ratings system to assess clinical changes in areas such as memory and how patients were able to care for themselves over a two-year period. The studies aimed for a 20% slowing of cognitive decline, trial details show.

Doustdar, who took over as CEO in August, is restructuring the company to compete with Eli Lilly.

Wall Street analysts viewed the trials as high-risk, high-reward, and had said the data would determine if Novo’s Alzheimer’s program could become a future growth driver.

Treatments launched in the past several years by companies including Eli Lilly and an Eisai-Biogen partnership are the first drugs ever shown to slow cognitive decline in people with Alzheimer’s after years of failed trials, but they require infusions or injections and can cause significant side effects.",literal
"Opinion: Remembering Bob Trumpy — NFL great, broadcaster, and life-saver

toggle caption Sporting News via Getty Images

Bob Trumpy, who died this week at the age of 80, was an All-Pro tight end for the Cincinnati Bengals, then took his booming voice and blunt opinions into broadcasting.

He had a show called Sportstalk on Cincinnati's WLW Radio. Sports radio can be loud and raucous, blaring with bluster and bellowing. ""Can you believe that? What were they thinking?""

But one night in 1983, the first person to call in said her name was Sugar. She said she had been drinking, and was married to a man who beat her. She said that she hadn't worked for more than a decade and could not support her 19-year-old son. And, Sugar said, she wanted to end her life.

""I don't know why she called a sports talk show,"" Trumpy told the Los Angeles Times, years later. ""It was probably just the first number she heard on the radio and decided to call it.""

And he kept Sugar talking, and safe — live, on the air — for two and a half hours.

""It would be a shame for you to check out by yourself when you like people so much,"" Bob Trumpy told her, according to an Associated Press story about the call. ""This is a cry for help, and I'm not going to let that go unheard.""

Sugar's son finally came on the line and revealed where they lived. Emergency workers were able to reach her before she harmed herself.

Trumpy received praise for how he handled Sugar's call, but the experience jarred him. ""I sure didn't feel like a hero after that,"" he told the Los Angeles Times years later. ""She wasn't the only one who had to go to a crisis center for therapy. So did I.""

Trumpys' grandfather had taken his own life when Trumpy was six years old. After his conversation with Sugar, he told the Cincinnati Post, ""I kept seeing my grandfather in his coffin.""

He would go on to announce NFL games, Super Bowls, and the Olympics for NBC Sports. But the broadcast of Trumpy's life was the night he stayed on the line for hours with a stranger who needed help. He helped save Sugar's life, and in speaking so bluntly about his own struggles, he may have moved others to ask for help, too.",figurative
"This year marks three decades since the end of the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, in which an estimated 100,000 people lost their lives. The war culminated in the Srebrenica genocide in July 1995, in which the Bosnian Serb forces, led by General Ratko Mladić, known as the “Butcher of Bosnia”, massacred more than 8,000 men and boys in a United Nations-designated “safe area”.

In the following decades, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia heard hundreds of witnesses and sentenced dozens of high-ranking Bosnian Serb political and military leaders, including those convicted of genocide. Meanwhile, the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina and foreign donors put significant funds into the study, victim recovery and remembrance of the genocide.

When the genocide in Gaza began, many Bosnians who survived the 1992-1995 war saw striking parallels between their own experiences and the suffering of Palestinians. Many took to the streets and spoke out against the genocidal war in Palestine.

However, many Bosnian intellectuals, especially those researching war crimes and genocide, have remained silent. Their refusal to speak out harms not just efforts to deliver justice for Gaza but also undermines the field of genocide studies.

Voices of conscience

Before we explore why Gaza has become such a taboo topic for Bosnian genocide scholars, it is important to point out that not all have remained silent. A relatively small group of Bosnian scholars who are not only academics but also active advocates for Palestine and human rights have chosen to speak up.

University professors and researchers, such as Lejla Kreševljaković, Sanela Čekić Bašić, Gorana Mlinarević, Jasna Fetahović, and Sanela Kapetanović have underscored that there is moral responsibility not to remain silent. They have led by example, participating in protests and speaking out in public.

Belma Buljubašić, a professor at the Faculty of Political Science at the University of Sarajevo, has criticised European and other political leaders who express sympathy for Srebrenica while justifying Israel’s actions in Gaza as acts of “self-defence”. Such double standards, she has argued, reveal a troubling pragmatism that undermines both solidarity and accountability.

In a recent interview, Edina Bećirević, a genocide scholar at the University of Sarajevo’s Faculty of Criminalistics, Criminology and Security Studies, said the genocide in Gaza clearly mirrors the dynamics seen in Srebrenica, defined by dehumanisation, ideological mobilisation and international complicity.

Ahmet Alibašić, the director of the Center for Advanced Studies and professor at the Faculty of Islamic Studies at the University of Sarajevo, has also been outspoken. Last year, he co-organised a seminar called From the Balkans to Gaza: A Critical Analysis of Genocide, which examined contemporary dynamics of mass violence through a “comparison between the Srebrenica genocide, the Sarajevo siege and the unfolding genocide in Gaza”.

Nidžara Ahmetašević, a Sarajevo-based journalist and media scholar, has also not hesitated to draw parallels between Gaza and the experiences of Bosnian survivors from besieged Sarajevo and Srebrenica.

For months, members of the Sarajevo Feminist Anti-Militarist Collective have been conducting demonstrations in downtown Sarajevo in which they read the names of children killed in Gaza, juxtaposing war crimes in the occupied Palestinian territory to Sarajevo’s own war horrors.

These individuals have all responded in various ways to the late Palestinian scholar Edward Said’s enduring exhortation that intellectuals must claim the space to speak truth to power, connect local memory to global justice and resist the politics of convenient truth-telling. Silence remains not a neutral stance but a political choice that sustains harm.

‘Not our battle’

Still, Said’s call has not stirred everyone to action. Paradoxically, many Bosnian genocide scholars have remained conspicuously silent, even as their colleagues abroad, among them Israeli genocide scholars Omer Bartov, Amos Goldberg and Shmuel Lederman, have publicly accused Israel of committing genocide in Gaza. This did not change even after the International Association of Genocide Scholars, the world’s largest academic body in the field, passed a resolution in August declaring that Israel’s actions in Gaza constitute a genocide.

Advertisement

Various experts on genocide at the University of Sarajevo’s Institute for Research of Crimes Against Humanity and International Law, lecturers at the Faculty of Law of the University of Sarajevo and genocide scholars at the Institute for Islamic Tradition of Bosniaks have been reluctant to comment on Israeli war crimes in Gaza.

As an institution, the Institute for Research of Crimes Against Humanity and International Law publicly addressed Gaza only after it was clear a ceasefire was soon to take effect. On October 8, it issued an evasive statement that did not mention Israel as the perpetrator of atrocities. This prompted some observers to accuse the institute, led by Muamer Džananović, of a calculated and opportunistic approach to the issue.

However, probably the most notable is the case of Emir Suljagić, genocide survivor and director of the Srebrenica Memorial Center. When asked about his stance on Gaza in late 2023, Suljagić told Haaretz: “This is not our battle.”

Many Bosnia-watchers swiftly condemned his remarks, pointing at the double standards of his position, given that just a year earlier Suljagić published an op-ed urging Ukrainians “not to lay down their arms”.

Furthermore, under his leadership, the Srebrenica Memorial Center produced a series of case studies funded by the United Kingdom government on Ukraine, Syria, South Sudan and Ethiopia, highlighting early warning signs of mass violence and genocide.

When the Palestinian community in Bosnia and Herzegovina expressed surprise over the lack of solidarity from Srebrenica with the people of Gaza, questioning whether the Srebrenica Memorial Center’s ties to the World Jewish Congress had something to do with its silence, Suljagić responded by accusing them of anti-Semitism.

He went even as far as to compare Hamas members to Chetniks, Serb nationalist and royalist forces that collaborated with German, Italian and at times Croatian fascists during World War II. Chetniks were responsible for some of the most brutal atrocities, including acts of genocide, against the Bosnian Muslim population. Almost half a century later, their enduring ideology fuelled war crimes and genocide against Bosniaks during the war in Bosnia.

The price of silence

The silence of many of Bosnia’s genocide scholars is not accidental. Some of them fear professional repercussions in Western academia and feel that accusing Israel of genocide would be unfavourable for their careers. Many are reluctant to jeopardise external financial support from foreign embassies, particularly funding provided by American, British and European Union donors to their projects and “side hustle” NGOs. Others are reluctant to alienate diplomatic partners who still wield influence over Bosnia’s fragile peace.

None of this, of course, justifies the silence of scholars working at institutions funded by Bosnian taxpayers rather than foreign donors. As genocide researchers whose work is sustained by public funds, they have an obligation to serve the public interest, which entails upholding scientific integrity, defending evidence-based genocide research and contributing to the global scholarly consensus without fear of professional repercussions.

When scholars, genocide researchers and lecturers at public institutions fail to speak out on war crimes or humanitarian crises, they contribute to legitimising a discourse that conceals harm. Such a discourse frames certain acts of mass violence as unworthy of the same scrutiny applied to other cases, creating a hierarchy of victimhood that serves political interests rather than universal principles and scholarly integrity.

Said’s universal call on intellectuals to speak out remains relevant and urgent. It reminds us that we need to move beyond comfortable silence, expose distortions of power and advocate for justice, transparency and accountability. In his view, silence is a form of complicity that undermines the very pursuit of truth that academia claims to uphold.

In this sense, public intellectuals must never allow themselves to slip into the realm of political bargaining where silence about one genocide is traded for recognition of another. If their advocacy becomes selective, then they risk turning genocide studies into a political tool. If that happens, genocide scholars will cease to be independent academics and instead become an interest group, stripped of the moral pedestal they so readily claim.

By foregrounding Gaza within the Bosnian context, we argue for a renewed ethic of intellectual responsibility and integrity, one that aligns scholarly discernment with public accountability and humane justice.

"By her own admission, Donna Jean Godchaux was not a fan of the Grateful Dead when she arrived in California – then Donna Jean Thatcher – in 1970. Already a music industry veteran at 23, she had spent five years as a member of Southern Comfort, a group of singers regularly employed as backing vocalists at the renowned Fame studios in her native Alabama. But she was rigidly unimpressed with her San Francisco friends’ undying devotion to Jerry Garcia and co. She hated the band’s name and loudly opined that the only reason people liked them was because they were invariably out of their minds on drugs when they went to see them live. In fact, she could prove she was right: she offered to attend a Dead show sober, certain she would hate it.

It proved a fateful decision. By the end of the Dead’s set at the Winterland Ballroom, Thatcher – ostensibly retired from music – had announced: “If I sing again, it will be with this band”. Through attending other Dead shows she met a local pianist named Keith Godchaux, whom she subsequently married, and after meeting Garcia and angling for him to give her new husband a job, she found herself hired as well.

On one occasion during the Europe ’72 tour, Godchaux took to the stage having taken 15 hits of LSD

It says something about the Grateful Dead’s unique position in American rock that Godchaux’s eight-year tenure with the band came to define her. It wasn’t as if her CV were lacking before she joined. Fame Studios was notoriously spotty when it came to crediting backing vocalists, so no complete record of her performances there exists, but she sang on Elvis Presley’s Suspicious Minds and In the Ghetto; Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman, and Warm and Tender Love; and with Aretha Franklin, Otis Redding and Dionne Warwick among others.

Her timing in joining the Dead was fortuitous: their sound had taken a turn for the rootsy with 1970’s Workingman’s Dead and American Beauty – two key texts in the development of what would come to be called Americana – but the band’s usual source of traditionally soulful vocals, the blues-influenced keyboard player Ron “Pigpen” McKernan, was ailing, stricken by the alcoholism that hastened his death in 1973. Steeped in a different musical tradition to the rest of the band, Godchaux’s voice swiftly became part of their sound, as evidenced by her contributions to guitarist Bob Weir’s solo debut Ace – a Dead album in all but name – and Europe ’72, the triple-vinyl live set that documented the band’s visit to the continent in the spring of that year, and a strong contender for the title of greatest Grateful Dead album of all.

But Godchaux’s apparently seamless integration into the band wasn’t quite as straightforward as it looked. She was a studio singer rather than a live vocalist, and the nightly high-wire act of the Grateful Dead’s live shows was quite the baptism by fire. Their three-hour-plus gigs were performed without a setlist, with members either calling for songs on stage in the style of jazz musicians at a jam session, or else by steering improvised passages towards the next track on the spot. In addition, it was a high-wire act that, in the early 70s at least, was often performed on acid. On one notable occasion during the Europe ’72 tour, Godchaux took to the stage having taken 15 hits of LSD, unaware that the band’s supply – which had been weakening in strength as the tour progressed – had been replenished with fresh, undiluted provisions. In her account, she spent most of the show lying prone under her husband’s piano, but somehow still made it to the microphone in time to sing.

Furthermore, while there were certainly some formidable women within the Dead’s inner circle – including Garcia’s partner Carolyn Adams, audio engineer and producer Betty Cantor-Jackson, and drummer Bill Kreutzmann’s wife Susila, who more or less singlehandedly started the band’s merchandising empire – its core was exclusively male and, as their biographer Dennis McNally tactfully put it, “not a bastion of feminist liberation”. But Godchaux, the only female member of the Grateful Dead during their 30-year history, was clearly made of stern stuff. She seldom took a lead vocal but demurred at the label “backing vocalist”, preferring the term “ensemble singing” – which certainly fits the sound of Godchaux and her band members belting out the choruses of Playing the Band or Eyes of the World en masse.

Still, she proved a controversial figure. The culture of fans obsessively taping Grateful Dead shows meant that mistakes as well as transcendent moments were captured for posterity, and the mistakes often involved re-creating complex vocal harmonies on stage. But it seemed hugely unfair that Godchaux’s voice was singled out for criticism given how pitchy the other members could sound. And Godchaux was often magnificent in concert, as the belatedly released live albums One from the Vault or The Closing of Winterland proved.

In the studio, her voice was unimpeachable. Hear the depth her harmonies bring to Row Jimmy and Stella Blue, two impossibly beautiful ballads from 1973’s Wake of the Flood, the raw soulfulness of her voice on 1975’s The Music Never Stopped or her fantastic contributions to 1977’s slick Terrapin Station. And if you want to venture away from the Grateful Dead per se, her vocals on Palm Sunday and the brief Down Home from the Jerry Garcia Band’s 1978 album Cats Under the Stars are incredible.

Keith and Donna Godchaux both left the Grateful Dead after 1978’s patchy Shakedown Street, an album that sounded distinctly coked-out. The couple moved to Alabama to deal with Keith’s worsening drug problem, and he had apparently conquered his addictions when he was killed in a car crash in 1980.

Donna Jean married bass player David MacKay in 1981, becoming Donna Jean Thatcher Godchaux-Mackay, and formed a succession of other bands, but she never really left the Grateful Dead behind. She still performed their songs. Her version of Crazy Fingers is a highlight of the 2014 album she recorded with Jeff Matson, and Matson is a member of the Grateful Dead tribute band the Zen Tricksters, with whom Godchaux also recorded an album. She also happily sat in on stage with the Dark Star Orchestra, a band dedicated to recreating classic Dead shows live, became involved with the unending stream of archival Grateful Dead releases, and occasionally appeared on stage with various former band members.

Once a controversial addition, her role in the band seemed to be burnished by the passing of time. Deadheads can argue for hours about which of their lineups was the best, but the Godchaux-bolstered 70s version is always in strong contention. It was something that the band’s official statement about her death seemed to touch on: “Her contributions will forever remain part of the tapestry that continues to be woven.”",figurative
"The flu has started spreading earlier than usual in some parts of the country, prompting concerns that cases could soon erupt as millions of Americans travel and gather for Thanksgiving and other upcoming holidays.

The warning signs come as a form of the virus, called H3N2 subclade K, has set off massive outbreaks in Canada and the U.K.

Dr. Cameron Wolfe, an infectious disease specialist at Duke University School of Medicine in Durham, North Carolina, said he’s noted a sharp increase in flu cases over the past few weeks.

“Typically, I might see one or two cases a week at this point,” Wolfe said. “At the moment, we’ve had two, three, four per day coming in.”

Alicia Budd, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s domestic influenza surveillance team, said: “We certainly do expect we’re going to see influenza activity increasing over the next several weeks.”

The majority of flu circulating so far this season in the U.S. is the H3N2 strain, according to the CDC. H3N2 flus tend to cause more hospitalizations and deaths in older adults.

An early uptick in cases, Wolfe said, can create unique risks for this age group.

“If you’re seeing a really early flu season, you run the risk that some nursing homes may not have finished their vaccine deployments. Maybe a hospital hasn’t fully vaccinated its staff,” Wolfe said. “The community in general may not be as protected as it might have been if a virus turns up in January, for example.”

While flu activity is considered low overall, the CDC’s latest flu report shows cases are on the rise. The agency estimates that at least 650,000 people have had the flu so far this season. Around 7,400 people have been hospitalized and 300 have died, according to the report.

The uptick in cases and emergency room visits are occurring mostly in children, Budd said.

Last year, 280 children in the U.S. died from the flu. It was the deadliest flu season ever recorded for children, aside from the 2009-10 H1N1 pandemic.

No pediatric deaths have been reported so far this season. Still, the early rise in flu activity is unsettling for doctors who spent last winter watching the virus sweep through schools, day cares and, consequently, hospitals.

“It feels like the calm before the storm,” said Dr. Buddy Creech, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee. “We may have a difficult influenza year.”

The H3N2 strain is known for its ability to mutate easily. The subclade K form of the strain popped up over the summer with a handful of mutations. It emerged after the makeup of this season's flu shots had been set.

Budd, of the CDC, said the agency is studying how well the flu vaccine matches this latest flu strain. Still, she encouraged people to get the shot.

The majority of flu circulating so far this year is an A strain, called H3N2, according to the CDC. H3N2 is known for its ability to mutate easily.

This particular H3N2 variant, referred to as subclade K, popped up over the summer, after the makeup of this year’s flu shots had been set. It’s already caused massive outbreaks in Canada and the U.K.

Budd said the agency is studying how well the flu vaccine matches this latest flu strain. Still, she encouraged people to get the shot.

“Even in years where the strain in the vaccine may not be as similar to the strains that we’re seeing circulating, we know that the vaccine can help prevent severity of illness,” Budd said.

Doctors across the U.S. are closely monitoring increases in flu cases.

“Does it turn on our antenna a little bit more? Yes,” said Dr. Daniel Varga, chief physician executive at Hackensack Meridian Health in New Jersey. “It makes us be even more vigilant at looking at the traditional monitoring we do locally.”

Dr. Melanie Kitagawa, medical director of the pediatric intensive care unit at Texas Children’s Hospital in Houston, said it’s still not too late to get a flu shot.

“The more people we can get vaccinated prior to the start of the flu season, the better it’s going to be,” Kitagawa said.",literal
"White House cites groups’ alleged support for Hamas, accusing them of waging campaign against US interests and allies.

Washington, DC – United States President Donald Trump has ordered his aides to start a process to label the branches of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, Lebanon and Jordan as “terrorist” organisations, citing their alleged support for the Palestinian group Hamas.

Trump issued the decree on Monday as Washington intensified its crackdown on Israel’s foes in the region.

The decree accused Muslim Brotherhood leaders in Jordan of providing “material support” to Hamas and the Lebanese branch of the group – known as al-Jamaa al-Islamiya – of siding with Hamas and Hezbollah in their war with Israel.

It also claimed that an Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood leader “called for violent attacks against United States partners and interests” during Israel’s war on Gaza. But it was not clear what the White House was referring to. The Muslim Brotherhood has been banned in Egypt and mostly driven underground.

“President Trump is confronting the Muslim Brotherhood’s transnational network, which fuels terrorism and destabilization campaigns against US interests and allies in the Middle East,” the White House said.

Trump’s order directs the secretary of state and the treasury secretary to consult with the US intelligence chief and produce a report on the designation within 30 days.

A formal “foreign terrorist organisation” label would then officially apply to the Muslim Brotherhood branches within 45 days after the report.

The process is usually a formality, and the designation may come sooner. The decree also opens the door to blacklisting other Muslim Brotherhood branches.

The White House is also pushing to label the groups as “designated global terrorists”.

The designations would make it illegal to provide material support to the group. It would also mostly ban their current and former members from entering the US, and enable economic sanctions to choke their revenue streams.

Longstanding demand of right-wing activists

Established in 1928 by Egyptian Muslim scholar Hassan al-Banna, the Muslim Brotherhood has offshoots and branches across the Middle East in the shape of political parties and social organisations.

Across the Middle East, Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated parties take part in elections and say they are committed to peaceful political participation.

But the group has been outlawed by several countries across the region.

Blacklisting the Muslim Brotherhood has been a longstanding demand for right-wing activists in the US.

But critics say that the move could further enable authoritarianism and the crackdown on free political expression in the Middle East.

The decree could also be used to target Muslim American activists on allegations of ties to the Muslim Brotherhood or contributions to charities affiliated with the group.

Right-wing groups have long pushed to outlaw Muslim American groups with unfounded accusations of ties to the Muslim Brotherhood.

Nihad Awad, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), said the designation should not have an impact on Muslim American advocacy groups and charities.

“The American Muslim organisations are solid,” Awad told Al Jazeera. “They are based in the US. The relief organisations serve millions of people abroad. I hope that this will not impact their work.”

But he noted that anti-Muslim activists have been trying to promote “the conspiracy theory that every Muslim organisation in the US is a front to the Muslim Brotherhood”.

Recently, Republican Texas Governor Greg Abbott designated both the Muslim Brotherhood and CAIR as “foreign terrorist organisations and transnational criminal organisations”.

CAIR has sued the governor’s office in response.

Analysts say Trump’s order was aimed at pandering to domestic audiences, and the threat of a terrorism designation means very little to the Middle East.

“It’s very amateurish foreign policy, but it appeals to the right-wing zealots in the US and Israel,” said Rami Khouri, a distinguished fellow at the American University of Beirut.

He noted that the order comes as the US tries “desperately to make progress” on the ceasefire in Gaza, which “the Israelis largely ignore, and Hamas largely adheres to”.

The White House wants to “keep showing that the Trump administration is doing everything it can to fight terrorism and bring peace and a happy, good life for all. This is, of course, fantasy,” Khouri said from the US city of Boston.

“I don’t think many people take it seriously. It’s not aimed at the Middle East. It’s aimed at domestic television audiences in the US and donors who provide the Republican Party with support, and the Republican Party is haemorrhaging support now because of its various and ineffective policies,” he added.",literal
"Opinion: Jane Goodall helped humans understand their place in the world

toggle caption Bela Szandelszky/AP

Outside the Field Museum in Chicago, a bronze sculpture by artist Marla Friedman captures a moment a friendship was made.

It's called ""The Red Palm Nut."" A young woman sits barefoot on the ground, reaching out her hand to a chimpanzee, who sits about a yard away. And he lightly, seemingly shyly, takes her human fingers into his own. A bright, red palm nut has dropped on the soil between them.

The woman in the sculpture is the great primatologist and conservationist Jane Goodall, at the moment she first earned the trust of a wild chimp. ""He reached out and he took and dropped that palm nut,"" she later remembered. ""But then very gently squeezed my fingers and that's how chimpanzees reassure each other. So in that moment we understood each other without the use of human words, the language of gestures.""

Jane Goodall called the silvery-chinned chimp David Greybeard. She met him when she was in her 20s, a former secretary from Bournemouth, England, who saved cash tips she'd earned as a waitress to journey to Africa, where she talked herself into a job as assistant to the famed anthropologist Louis Leakey.

She had no college experience. But Jane Goodall convinced Leakey she would be just the person to live among and study a group of chimpanzees he had discovered on the shores of Lake Tanganyika.

And on what she recalled was a rainy morning, November 4, 1960, she saw David Greybeard and other chimps take twigs from a tree, pluck their leaves, and use them as sticks to pierce a termite mound and slurp the insects off the end — almost like how those primates called human beings might lick peanut butter off a spoon.

What she saw and documented was startling: the chimps had made the twigs into tools. When she wrote about it to Louis Leakey, he famously replied, ""We must now redefine man, redefine tools, or accept chimpanzees as humans.""

By the time Jane Goodall died this week, at the age of 91, she'd been honored around the world for her work with chimps and people, and established animal sanctuaries and forest conservation programs.

"Severe weather throughout the country threatens widespread disruptions during what's expected to be a record-high Thanksgiving travel week.

A tornado watch is in effect for parts of southeast Texas, including Houston, until 7 p.m. CT. Isolated large hail and damaging wind gusts up to 70 mph are also possible.

A flood watch remains in effect for parts of northeast Texas, southeast Oklahoma and southwest Arkansas, including Texarkana. Those areas are forecast to get 1 to 3 inches of rain in a short period of time.

Travel is expected to be slow across parts of east Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas and the western Gulf Coast on Monday.

A separate storm system affecting the northern Rockies will move across the Upper Midwest into New England through Wednesday.

Montana and western North Dakota are experiencing snowfall Monday, and scattered showers are affecting areas in Iowa, Kansas, Missouri and Illinois.

The storm will strengthen by Tuesday, bringing snow to Minnesota and northern Michigan. Heavy rain is also possible from the Gulf Coast up into the Northeast.

On Wednesday, snow will pass through Wisconsin and Michigan, with lake-effect snow picking up later in the day.

Snowfall totals are expected to be 3 to 6 inches from North Dakota to northern Michigan through Wednesday, with higher amounts possible in northern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.

Conditions are expected to clear in most of the country by Thanksgiving, except for lingering lake-effect snow and gusty winds across the Northeast and the Pacific Northwest.

The two storm systems could cause flight delays and dangerous driving conditions, as 82 million people in the United States are projected to travel at least 50 miles from home during the Thanksgiving holiday period from Tuesday to Dec. 1, according to the AAA.

""In regard to air travel, this is going to be the busiest Thanksgiving that we have on record,"" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said at a news conference Monday afternoon.

""The airports are going to be packed,"" Duffy added, encouraging all Thanksgiving flyers to arrive at airports early.

Tuesday will be the busiest travel day, with 52,000 scheduled flights, Duffy said.

Because of weather concerns, Duffy advised travelers to stay in touch with their airlines and to check their flight statuses on their airlines' apps.

Drawing from the Transportation Department's civility campaign, which was launched last week, Duffy encouraged people to have common courtesy, civility and patience when traveling.

He urged Thanksgiving flyers to ""say please and thank you"" to their pilots and flight attendants.

He also asked people to practice ""dressing with some respect"" at airports.

""Whether it's a pair of jeans and a decent shirt, I would encourage people to maybe dress a little better,"" Duffy said. ""Let's try not to wear slippers and pajamas as we come to the airport.""

Federal Aviation Administration Administrator Bryan Bedford expressed confidence ahead of the record-high travel period.

"With another set of global climate talks behind us, the Australian government faces some tricky tasks before it takes over negotiations at the next round of talks next year in Turkey.



Cop30 in Belém, Brazil, did not deliver the bold fossil fuel phase-out roadmap we needed, but it did nudge the system forward with more scrutiny of fossil fuel producers.



And despite the weakness of the outcome, one can gain some important comfort by the fact that Bélem – and the G20 in Johannesburg at the weekend – both solidly endorsed the Paris agreement, its central goal of keeping warming to 1.5C and the importance of net zero emissions.



Cop30 agreed that an “ambition accelerator” will be needed to fill the gap between what governments are planning (projected to warm the world by 2.6C) and the agreed guardrails of the Paris agreement: a limit of 1.5C.



It also, crucially, began the momentum for developing a roadmap for a just transition away from fossil fuels, with more than 80 countries – including Australia – signing the “Belém declaration” on a transition away from fossil fuels.

While this declaration didn’t get support from the whole conference, Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has promised to move forward on its implementation during the course of this year, until he hands over to Cop31 in Turkey.

And there, Australia, under its deal with Turkey, will take over that momentum.

But there are significant questions as to whether the government will be able – or more importantly willing – to move this momentum for a fossil fuel phase-out forward.



This is especially so given that the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has just doubled down on his patently false claim that gas is needed for the energy transition.

The International Energy Agency released its annual report in the first week of Cop30. Its net zero emissions pathway confirms our concerns about Australian gas. The IEA’s new net zero scenario clearly states there is no need for new long-lead oil and gas projects, or coalmines.



It says fossil gas use needs to reduce quickly to 40% below today’s levels by 2035. Importantly, it also warns that a massive glut of liquefied natural gas supply is developing, a glut that is consistent with the IEA’s current policy scenario that would warm the world by 3C by 2100.



Gas is not needed to replace coal, and is not doing so across Asia – the destination for the vast majority of Australian fossil gas exports.



Add to this the leaked Deloitte draft report to the Western Australian government that warned Australia’s gas export bonanza to Asia would crowd out renewables and lock in CO 2 emissions for years to come.



Yet yesterday the prime minister was still dancing around this question, saying Australia’s gas would be needed as a backup to renewables but also that this “firming” would not require any new gas fields and should see the government move toward a phase-out of the massive export program it has approved all the way to 2070.

The truth is that much less gas is going to be needed to “firm” renewables, as grid-scale battery technologies take over the market.

In the next breath Albanese confirmed that his government would continue to allow new gas fields to go ahead, just as he allowed the massive North West Shelf development go ahead to 2070.



These two statements are in direct contradiction with each other and do not bode well for the prospect of his government moving forward a global agreement that aims to get the world to transition away from fossil fuels.

The IEA has also confirmed that carbon capture and storage is not the magic bullet Australia claims it is to deal with fossil gas emissions. Indeed our work shows that if Asian countries – and Australia – continue with expansion plans for deploying CCS, they could add an extra 25bn tonnes of CO 2 emissions to the atmosphere by 2050.

There are many in Australia’s political scene who ask, what does all of this have to do with us?



For those who love Australia’s bush, forests, coral reefs, marine life and ecosystems, I would say nearly everything. Because all of this depends on keeping warming to 1.5C.

This month we’ve also seen reports emerge of massive coral mortality at Ningaloo reef, caused by climate change-fuelled marine heatwaves. This reef and others like it are finished unless we can get fossil fuels phased out quickly and achieve net zero CO 2 in the next 25 years or so.



It’s physics. Getting to net zero CO 2 globally means we can halt global warming.

And getting to net zero CO 2 means rapidly phasing out fossil fuels. There’s simply no other way.

Australia cannot continue to develop and expand fossil fuel exports and pretend it’s going to be a renewable superpower supporting a 1.5C limit.

These contradictions will come into sharp focus over the next year and they are likely to get increasingly dangerous for the Albanese government as people wake up to the climate catastrophe unfolding around them, while watching their government fumble on the world stage.",literal

"There have been at least six incidents of US strikes on boats in Venezuelan waters since the beginning of September.

On Thursday, the United States military carried out its latest strike on an alleged Venezuela drug smuggling vessel, as the admiral overseeing the Trump administration’s controversial campaign in the Caribbean Sea announced his early departure.

Officials did not offer additional details about the incident, in which they said there were some survivors — unlike the previous boat bombings.

US Secretary of War Pete Hegseth posted on X that Admiral Alvin Holsey of the Southern Command would be retiring at the end of the year, less than a year into the post, which is usually three years long.

The latest attack on a boat came a day after United States President Donald Trump confirmed that he authorised the CIA to carry out secret operations in Venezuela and suggested that he was mulling a land attack, too.

Trump told a reporter that he authorised the CIA to go into Venezuela because there are “a lot of drugs coming in from Venezuela, and a lot of the Venezuelan drugs come in through the sea, so you get to see that, but we’re going to stop them by land also”.

In a TV address on Wednesday, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro cautioned against further escalation, objecting to “failed regime changes … carried out by the CIA”.

So, how many Venezuelan boats has the US struck so far, how deadly have they been, and what troops has the Trump administration sent to the Caribbean Sea as it threatens the Maduro government in Venezuela?

How many vessels have been attacked so far?

The US has carried out at least six strikes on boats in Venezuelan waters since the start of September, killing some 27 people, after allegations that they were carrying narcotics.

However, the Trump administration has failed to provide evidence that the targeted boats were carrying narcotics bound for the US.

September 2

The US military killed 11 people in a strike on a vessel from Venezuela allegedly carrying illegal narcotics, Trump said on September 2. It was the first known operation since the US’s deployment of warships to the southern Caribbean.

Trump shared aerial footage of the bombing on his Truth Social account, stating, “Earlier this morning, on my Orders, U.S. Military Forces conducted a kinetic strike against positively identified Tren de Aragua Narcoterrorists in the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility. TDA is a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization, operating under the control of Nicolas Maduro, responsible for mass murder, drug trafficking, sex trafficking, and acts of violence and terror across the United States and Western Hemisphere.”

September 15

On September 15, Trump confirmed that three people had been killed by a US military strike on another Venezuelan vessel. He took to his Truth Social account to say that the operation had positively identified drug trafficking cartels. The post was accompanied by a video which appeared to show the boat exploding on the water.

September 19

This marked the third fatal attack on a vessel allegedly smuggling drugs. Trump posted on social media that the strike had killed three people who were affiliated with a designated terrorist organisation.

October 3

On October 3, the US government confirmed that four people had been killed when its forces destroyed a boat allegedly involved in drug trafficking on the high seas not far from Venezuela.

October 14

In its latest operation, the US killed six people on board a boat in international waters near the Venezuelan coast, Trump confirmed on social media on Tuesday.

In his post, he wrote, “Intelligence confirmed the vessel was trafficking narcotics, was associated with illicit narcoterrorist networks, and was transiting along a known route for smuggling.”

October 16

In Thursday’s attack on the suspected drug vessel, there were survivors, unlike the previous strikes. Unlike previous attacks on boats, US officials have not posted photos of the attack.

It is unclear whether US forces offered medical help to the survivors, whether they were captured, or where they are now.

Is the US breaking international law?

Human Rights Watch (HRW) has said the maritime strikes amount to “extrajudicial killings”.

“US officials cannot summarily kill people they accuse of smuggling drugs,” said Sarah Yager, Washington director at HRW. “The problem of narcotics entering the United States is not an armed conflict, and US officials cannot circumvent their human rights obligations by pretending otherwise.”

The use of military force against foreign ships in international waters is considered unlawful unless a clear legal exception applies. In a letter to Congress on September 4 Trump cited the right to self-defence as justification for the US’s actions at sea.

Coastal countries like Venezuela control the waters within 12 nautical miles (22km) of their shores, known as territorial waters, where they have full sovereignty. Beyond that, they can claim up to 200 nautical miles (370km) as an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).

Under the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), all states enjoy freedom of navigation and overflight on the high seas, which lie beyond any nation’s control. Ships there fall under the jurisdiction of the country whose flag they fly, except when involved in piracy or other illegal acts.

Where are US ships deployed?

In August, Washington started deploying warships just outside Venezuelan waters.

On August 14, the US Fleet Forces Command published a news release stating sailors and Marines assigned to the Iwo Jima Amphibious Ready Group had departed from Norfolk, Virginia and Camp Lejeune, North Carolina.

According to the latest United States Southern Command – one of 11 unified combatant commands of the Department of Defense responsible for Latin America, Central America, the Caribbean, and surrounding waters – various strike packages and naval assets are in proximity to Venezuela.

Additionally, air and naval assets, including Reaper drones, Poseidon aircraft, amphibious transport docks and strike packages, are stationed around the coast of Puerto Rico.",literal
"From the shir to the kgotla, Africa’s history demonstrates that democratic practice is indigenous, and reclaiming it is the key to a stronger future.

For far too long, African youth have been told that democracy is something imported, something borrowed, something foreign to their identity. But history gives us a very different truth. Democracy is not an idea that arrived from the West. It is a human idea. And Africa practised it long before modern states existed.

Africa’s democratic inheritance is older than the colonial borders that sliced the continent into fragments. In the Somali shir, every man could stand, argue, and vote in open councils that decided collective affairs. The Oromo Gadaa system developed rotating leadership and fixed term limits centuries before they became fashionable anywhere else. Igbo communities governed through village assemblies that rejected kings and insisted on consensus. The Ashanti used councils of elders to check the power of chiefs and remove them when they broke trust. In Botswana, the Tswana kgotla provided public debate forums where leaders listened more than they spoke. These systems did not look identical to modern democracies, but the principle was unmistakable: power must serve the community, and the community must hold power accountable.

Democratic ideas are not confined to any one civilisation. Ancient Athens developed its own form of citizen rule. Islamic governance emphasised shura, consultation. Confucian models in East Asia built a meritocratic civil service long before Europe did. And when modern democracy regained momentum in the 18th century, America made a historic contribution by not only establishing it but sustaining it through institutions that could survive war, crisis, and political division. That legacy is real and should never be dismissed. But democracy’s story is not Western. It is human. And Africa’s contribution to it is undeniable.

Today, young Africans face a new challenge. They are living in the attention economy, where anger spreads faster than reason and where misinformation travels in seconds. This environment creates enormous pressure on leaders to react rather than reflect. It rewards the strongman’s sprint instead of the institution’s marathon. But democracies win marathons, not sprints. The short-term appeal of authoritarian certainty can never match the long-term stability of accountable institutions. Africa cannot afford to trade long-term freedom for short-term frustration.

Modern African societies are not starting from zero. Botswana’s democratic resilience, Senegal’s peaceful transfers of power, Ghana’s strengthening institutions, and Kenya’s judicial independence show that African democracies can adapt, evolve, and correct themselves. At the same time, other countries face real challenges: contested elections, corruption, political exclusion, and the weaponisation of identity. Naming these problems honestly is not a weakness. It is how democracies grow.

Reclaiming democracy today must also mean expanding it. The systems of the past often excluded women and marginalised groups. A modern African democracy must belong equally to women, young people, minorities, and all those whose voices were historically silenced. Reclaiming an inheritance does not mean returning to the past. It means carrying it forward with greater justice.

Technology is Africa’s new multiplier. Artificial intelligence, digital platforms, and open learning resources can give young Africans something no previous generation ever had: the ability to learn globally and compete globally without asking permission from any gatekeeper. Connectivity is still uneven. Infrastructure is still expensive. Policies lag behind innovation. But the potential is unmistakable. Every major leap in human history rewarded the adopters: the printing press, steam power, electricity, the green revolution, the internet, and now AI. Africa has a young population. If it embraces AI early, with strong civic values and clear safeguards, the continent can achieve a leap no region has ever achieved.

Democracy is not protected by slogans. It is protected by habits. Young Africans can strengthen democracy not only in elections but in everyday practice. Reviving local consultative forums. Creating student parliaments. Running community debates. Challenging misinformation. Defending independent journalism. Building digital literacy campaigns. These small habits create big cultures. And perhaps most importantly, Africans must reject the narrative that democracy belongs to somebody else. Authoritarianism is not African. Silence is not African. The continent’s heritage is debate, dialogue, consensus, accountability, and community decision-making. To reclaim democracy is to reclaim what Africa has always known: that power must be held in trust, not taken by force.

Advertisement

The future belongs to the young. If African youth defend their voice, their freedom, their diversity, their truth, and their dignity, they will build institutions stronger than any individual. They will build a continent where unity does not erase nations and where sovereignty does not silence citizens. A continent where Africa rises not as a copy of another model but as itself. Democracy is not something Africa must borrow. It is something Africa is ready to lead.

"Roséwave: Simple Pleasures

toggle caption Lars Gotrich/NPR

The sun was ruthless, but the music was light. On the way home from work, I stepped into my neighborhood corner store, grabbed a bag of chips and something cold to drink. As I sipped a Cherry Coke ICEE, ""Diet Pepsi"" hummed in my headphones. Until that moment, Addison Rae's appeal eluded me: another TikTokker with a record deal. Suddenly, the syrupy sweet slushee clinked proverbial glasses with the pop song's uncomplicated-yet-satisfying elixir. And something clicked. Oh, this is what roséwave was built upon: simple pleasures in the summer.

Roséwave, for those not privy to its basic charms, is a series that we started in 2017 that celebrates a summer-y, feel-good lifestyle. There is truly a roséwave playlist for any occasion: swiping on the apps, catching the poolboy's eye, the summer getaway, poolside vibes, crying. It's always been meant as a hit-play-and-chill escape — even if just momentary — with a little something for everyone.

"A man called into a D.C. radio station and said he saw a dead body weeks earlier in Frederick, Maryland. Police searched the area and found someone dead.

A man who called himself Joseph called in to “Elliot in the Morning” on DC101 on Friday and launched into a story about being out “exploring nature.”

“Look what I came upon,” the caller said on audio the show provided to NBC News.

“Dude, you found a dead body?” the host asks.

“Yes,” the caller replies.

“Dude, call the police!” the host repeatedly urges him.

The radio caller said he saw the body in a “tent city” in Frederick and it remained there “as of, whatever, 18 days ago.”

Later Friday, the Frederick Police Department said they were aware of information shared on a radio show about someone found dead in a wooded area off East Street and Carroll Creek Crossing.

Detectives responded and found someone dead. An investigation is underway.

The name of the person who died was not immediately released, nor was information on how they may have died. It was unclear if the radio caller contacted police.",literal
"Opinion: A little league heartbreak

toggle caption Dylan Buell/Getty Images

The Senior League World Series championship, for Little Leaguers ages 13 to 16 from all over the world, is played today in Easly, South Carolina. But the Cacique Mara team from Maracaibo, Venezuela couldn't compete. They won the Latin American qualifier rounds in Mexico last month, but were denied travel visas to the United States.

President Trump signed a proclamation in June to ban or partly ban citizens from 19 countries including Afghanistan, Cuba, Iran, and Venezuela from entering the U.S. for national security concerns. But there were exemptions for athletes participating in the World Cup, the Olympics, or other major sporting events as determined by the secretary of state.

Sponsor Message

It is not clear why an immigration officer denied travel visas to this team of Venezuelan youngsters. A State Department spokesperson told us, they have ""a policy to grant national interest exceptions to qualified travelers participating in these types of sporting events on a case-by-case basis. Due to the additional processing time required, we recommend that applicants apply well in advance of their anticipated travel date.""

Of course, a baseball team playing in a championship tournament can't apply for a visa until they've won a spot in that tournament.

Kendry Gutiérrez, president of the Cacique Mara Little League, said in a statement that his players are ""...demoralized. All they know how to do is play baseball. They don't represent any threat; they are 15-year-old kids who want to win the World Cup.""

Not allowing this group of young athletes to come to the U.S. for a major sporting event raises some questions:

Will Iran's excellent national soccer team really be permitted to play 2026 World Cup soccer games in the US? Will athletes from Iran, Cuba, Venezuela and other listed countries really be given visas to compete at the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles?

Two other Little League teams from Venezuela, one from Valencia, another from Barquisimeto, were granted visas.

International sports competitions are often saluted for promoting respect across all boundaries. And so the decision not to give visas to these teenagers from Cacique Mara is hard to understand.

"University of Alabama at Birmingham offensive lineman Daniel Israel Mincey was charged Monday with attempted murder and first-degree assault after two teammates were stabbed hours before a game.

Mincey, 20, of Pompano Beach, Florida, was booked into the Jefferson County Jail on Saturday afternoon after campus police arrested him in connection with the attack that morning, according to jail records and a school spokesperson.

He remained behind bars Monday in lieu of $90,000 bail, jail records show. Charges were filed Monday, according to court documents.

One of two criminal complaints alleges that Mincey tried ""to intentionally cause the death of Jasire Peterson ... by stabbing him with a knife.""

The other alleges he committed ""assault 1st degree"" with ""serious physical injury to Joshua Underwood ... by stabbing him with a knife.""

Lawyer David Bigney said he represents Mincey's family, but said it's too early in the case to make public remarks.

""We are currently focused on gathering information and reviewing the evidence, which has not yet been fully received,"" he said. ""We ask for patience as the legal process moves forward.""

A spokesperson for the university, Alicia Rohan, said in a statement that the violence happened Saturday morning at the Birmingham campus' Football Operations Building.

The injured players were taken to a hospital, she said. ""Our thoughts are with them and their families as they recover,"" she said.

On Monday, UAB Blazers interim head coach Alex Mortensen said in video remarks posted to YouTube that he has met with the two injured players, who have been released from the hospital and are recovering.

The team lists both as defensive linemen.

Mincey has apparently been removed from the online roster. The Associated Press reported that he was an offensive lineman who transferred to UAB in May. The team’s online roster previously listed him as a 6-foot-4 redshirt freshman, who was previously at the University of Kentucky, the AP reported.

The university has not offered remarks about Mincey's status with the team.

Mortensen said at in a news conference after Saturday's loss against the University of South Florida that his team went ahead with the matchup to allow its seniors to play in their last game.

On Monday, he praised his players for pushing forward, even as some decided to sit it out. ""I think that was the biggest thing was that they wanted to play for each other on Saturday,"" he said.",literal
"Virginia police issued a statewide alert Monday for a missing high school football coach, who vanished in the midst of a law enforcement probe and his undefeated team's playoff run, officials said.

Travis Turner, the 46-year-old head coach of the Union High School Bears from Big Stone Gap, went missing on Thursday, according to a Virginia State Police posting.

The 6-foot-3, 260-pound man was last seen in Wise County, in the far southwest corner of the commonwealth, wearing a gray sweatshirt, sweatpants and glasses, police said.

Search teams, with the help of dogs and drones, were concentrating efforts Monday around the town of Appalachia, where Turner lives, state police spokesperson Matthew Demlien said.

""Virginia State Police has utilized a number of assets"" to ""hopefully locate Turner safely,"" Demlien added.

Agents of the VSP's Bureau of Criminal Investigation, based out of Wytheville, had been sent to Turner’s residence in Appalachia on Thursday as ""part of the investigation,"" Demlien said.

The agency spokesperson stressed that last week's visit was not aimed at arresting Turner, but he did not elaborate.

""While in transit, the agents were informed that Turner was no longer at the location,"" Demlein said.

Turner's disappearance came two days before his Bears defeated the Graham H.S. G-Men, 12-0, to advance in the Class 2 playoffs.

Union (12-0) will play Ridgeview in the region final on Saturday, with the winner going to the state semifinals on Dec. 6.

Wise County Public School Superintendent Mike Goforth said Turner is on administrative leave.

But the district administrator declined to elaborate on the nature of the leave or when exactly Turner's revised employment status began.

""A staff member has been placed on administrative leave with pay while an external agency reviews an allegation that was reported to the division,"" Goforth said in a statement Monday.

""This is standard procedure and is not a determination of wrongdoing,"" the statement said. ""This situation also involves an active law-enforcement matter, and the division cannot comment further.”",literal
"This week in books: Get stuck in a Nov. 18 time loop, and explore the world in 70 maps

NPR

Few dates on the calendar get shorter shrift than poor old November 18. Bereft of major holidays, all but anonymous, and cold — but not even cold enough to snow (at least in a lot of the U.S.) — it makes a strong claim for the year's least notable day.

So spare a bit of pity for Tara Selter. When readers first met the narrator of Danish author Solvej Balle's ongoing septology, On the Calculation of Volume, Tara was already on her 121st November 18 in a row. That number now stands well north of 1,100 (and counting) as the third installment of this mesmerizing time loop gets its English translation Tuesday.

For better or worse, though, her condition isn't catching. Ordinary folks like us only get one swing at this half-digested hairball of a date each year, so we may as well seize the day. Better yet, with new books on the docket from Joy Williams, Simon Winchester and Tracy K. Smith, among other talented writers, we probably ought to stay inside reading until the 19th.

On the Calculation of Volume Book III, by Solvej Balle, translated by Sophia Hersi Smith and Jennifer Russell

While six of the novels in Balle's seven-volume project have been published so far in the original Danish, this is the third to be translated into English, with the fourth expected in the spring. Don't be misled by the author's modest self-description – ""just another time-loop story"" – hers is an ambitious experiment nearly four decades in the making. ""It takes a familiar narrative trope – a protagonist inexplicably stuck in the same day – and transforms it into a profound meditation on love, connectedness and what it means to exist,"" said the judges who put Barbara Haveland's translation of the first volume on the shortlist for this year's International Booker Prize.

The Pelican Child: Stories, by Joy Williams

Williams is one of our most accomplished adepts in the art of estrangement — in literally making the mundane strange. The short stories in her latest collection are spiny little nuggets of jamais vu. Sure, they tend to bear the distinguishing characteristics of the familiar world, with all its stressed assistants and heiresses and bewildered man-children, but they're also moved by some alien inner logic that can be disquietingly difficult to discern. In Williams' hands, reality is a changeling with an occasionally wicked sense of humor.

Fear Less: Poetry in Perilous Times, by Tracy K. Smith

Speaking to NPR in 2017, Smith explained the human consolations of poetry in an era of disconnection and turmoil: It's ""a voice on a page that's saying, 'I have lived, I have felt, I have questions, and I have wishes.'""

In these essays, composed partly of close readings and broad commentary on the possibilities of poetry itself, Smith again proves to be an able ambassador for an artform.

"SANTA CLARA, Calif. — Christian McCaffrey gained 142 yards from scrimmage and scored a touchdown in his first game against Carolina since he was traded away three years ago, leading the San Francisco 49ers to a 20-9 victory over the Panthers on Monday night.

McCaffrey’s big night helped the 49ers (8-4) overcome three interceptions in the first half by Brock Purdy to remain in playoff position headed into the stretch run of the season.

Bryce Young and the Panthers (6-6) struggled to take advantage of their opportunities a week after he threw for a franchise-record 448 yards in a win at Atlanta. Young threw for just 169 yards with one touchdown and one interception as Carolina missed a chance to move into sole possession of first place in the NFC South.

The 49ers went conservative in the second half after Purdy’s rough start to the game, relying mostly on McCaffrey and short passes. The strategy worked with McCaffrey scoring on a 12-yard run to make it 17-3 and the Niners adding a field goal by Matt Gay.

Young did connect on one big play, a 29-yard TD pass to Tetairoa McMillan, but Carolina couldn’t convert on 2-point try after a penalty moved the ball to the 1.

Young then threw his second interception of the game to Ji’Ayir Brown with Carolina in scoring position with a 20-9 deficit.

McCaffrey, who has transformed the 49ers’ offense since being acquired in October 2022, finished with 89 yards rushing and 53 receiving for his 10th 100-yard game of the season — two shy of the franchise record he set in 2023.

The 49ers gave the ball to McCaffrey on the first five plays of the game, leading to the first opening-drive TD of the season against Carolina. Purdy connected on a 12-yard pass to Jauan Jennings for the score.

The two offenses did nothing after that. Purdy became the first player to throw three interceptions — Jaycee Horn got two of them — in the first half all season, but the Panthers turned those into only three points. Young ruined one drive when he was intercepted by Brown on a first-down play from the 1.

The teams traded field goals and the Niners led 10-3 at the half.",literal
"There was a grim familiarity to the unveiling of Donald Trump’s latest peace proposals for Ukraine last week. As in August, when the US president invited Vladimir Putin to a summit in Alaska, Kyiv and its European allies were excluded from discussions that ended up echoing Kremlin talking points. Yet again, Mr Trump publicly scolded Volodymyr Zelenskyy for not being more grateful for his ongoing mediation efforts. And as in the summer, Mr Zelenskyy and blindsided European leaders strove to stay polite while scrambling to limit the damage.

The salvage operation appears to have been relatively successful, following Sunday’s meeting in Geneva between the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and a Ukrainian delegation. The 28-point plan reportedly drafted by Mr Trump’s envoy, Steve Witkoff, and the Kremlin adviser, Kirill Dmitriev, was in effect a repackaging of Mr Putin’s maximalist demands. A deal premised on the handing over of new territory in the Donbas region to Russia, restrictions on Ukraine’s sovereignty, and drastic limits on the size of its future army, could never be acceptable to Kyiv. Mr Rubio, suggesting a more “refined” framework was now being developed, seemed to at least acknowledge this fundamental difficulty.

As the usual stream of self-regarding bluster and bombast emanates from the White House, it is impossible to know whether a negotiating endgame is truly at hand. But certain principles bear restating as a starting point for meaningful talks. Future European security, and the basic principles of international law, demand that Mr Putin’s brutal aggression is not simply rubber-stamped and rewarded, and that Ukraine’s sovereignty and independence is prioritised. To Kyiv’s persistent disadvantage, Mr Trump’s administration likes to position itself as a neutral broker between unequal warring parties. In response, European countries must insist on a proactive role in forthcoming peace negotiations, and try to exert some moral leverage.

Europe, after all, is now bearing the bulk of the cost of Ukraine’s continued resistance. It can use its influence and collective weight to furnish Mr Zelenskyy with the negotiating cards which Mr Trump has previously asserted that he lacks. If the EU can belatedly reach agreement on a €140bn “reparations loan” to Kyiv, underwritten by frozen Russian assets, Mr Putin’s apparent judgment that he can outlast Ukrainian resistance may begin to look questionable. A combination of arms and financial support, and greater economic pressure on Russia, are needed to alter calculations in the Kremlin and genuinely bring Mr Putin to the negotiating table.

This, rather than attempting to bully Mr Zelenskyy into a form of capitulation, is the path to achieving a just and sustainable peace. As Ukraine’s president wearily restated at the weekend: “The crux of the entire diplomatic situation is that it was Russia, and only Russia, that started this war, and it is Russia, and only Russia, that has been refusing to end it.”

There are already signs that the Kremlin is preparing to reject modifications to Mr Witkoff’s Putin-friendly plan. Yet whether through naivety, a crude notion of realpolitik or a greedy desire to open up Russian markets, Mr Trump and his aides seem repeatedly minded to lobby for peace on Moscow’s terms. Searching for a moral compass in the White House is a futile exercise. Europe’s leaders need to start trying to shape some facts on the ground.",literal
"In an astonishing victory, 34-year-old state legislator Zohran Mamdani won New York City’s mayoral election. Defeating former state Governor Andrew Cuomo, who enjoyed strong backing from US President Donald Trump and the political establishment, Mamdani became the city’s first Muslim immigrant mayor and its youngest in more than a century. The democratic socialist’s victory sent shock waves through national politics, emboldening progressives across the country to run and to win on agendas as unapologetically ambitious as the moment demands.

Campaigning across the city, Mamdani reached out to various social groups, including African Americans, Muslims, Jews, Hindus, East Africans and South Asians, and especially the youth, many of whom had grown politically disengaged after the Democratic Party’s demoralising performance in recent years. He brought people back into the political process, mobilising voters who otherwise might have stayed home.

Running on a platform calling for a more equitable distribution of wealth through higher taxes on the super-wealthy, a more affordable and accessible housing market, a free and faster public bus system, and universal, no-cost childcare for children from six weeks to five years old, Mamdani has brought into the mainstream a political discourse centred on equity, one the nation has arguably not witnessed since Eugene V Debs, the early 20th-century socialist organiser and five-time presidential candidate who championed workers’ rights and economic justice.

Advertisement

When asked live on television what “democratic socialist” means, Mamdani replied: “When we talk about my politics, I call myself a democratic socialist in many ways inspired by the words of Dr [Martin Luther] King [Jr] from decades ago who said, ‘Call it democracy, or call it democratic socialism. There has to be a better distribution of wealth for all of God’s children in this country.’”

But what, really, is “democratic socialism”? To many, the term “socialism” evokes the economic system of the former Soviet Union, characterised by inefficient allocation of resources, state control and ownership of productive assets, and political repression under a brutally totalitarian regime. Yet that is not what socialism means.

As the late Erik Olin Wright, one of the most influential sociologists of the past half-century and a pioneering scholar of class analysis in capitalism, detailed, what was practised by the Soviet Union was not socialism but “statism”, an economic system in which state incumbents control investment and production through a centralised planning apparatus. Indeed, in common parlance, most people use the term “socialism” to describe what is most accurately referred to as statism.

Over the past century, struggles for more equal alternatives to capitalism have been waged under the banner of “socialism”. Yet the term itself has long been contested, its precise meaning the subject of intense debate both within and without the academic and policy circles.

If nothing else, Karl Marx himself saw socialism as grounded in two essential principles. First, it required the democratisation of not only political life, which refers to the procedural democracy exercised in most developed countries, but also economic life, so that ordinary workers have a voice in how economic resources are distributed. Second, socialism envisioned a reduction in working hours, so that people could cultivate their creative capacities outside the workplace. Indeed, Marx’s critique of capitalism stemmed largely from his belief that it curtails “human flourishing and self-actualisation”.

Yet the socialist experiments of the 19th and 20th centuries across the world bore no resemblance to these humanistic ideals. Socialism, once seen as an economic system that would extend democracy into realms capitalism would never allow, turned into a centralised, grossly inefficient, and authoritarian state apparatus of command and control of both the economy and society. Soviet-style dictatorships rife with corruption and venality turned socialism into a vehicle for state domination rather than human liberation. With shortages, rationing, and long lines in stores, socialism came to be seen by the 1980s as a failed project of social transformation in the places where it was implemented.

So, what is “democratic socialism”?

The term is composed of two words: “democratic” and “socialism”. Democracy is fundamentally a socialist principle. Indeed, democracy is the most effective political mechanism we know for ensuring that the state serves as an agent of the people. If “democracy” is the term to signify the subordination of state power to people’s power, “socialism” is the term to signify the subordination of economic power to people’s power. In democratic socialism, control over investment and production is organised through genuinely democratic means. The central moral objective of democratic socialism is that a national economy should be organised in such a way as to serve the needs and aspirations of ordinary people, not those of elites.

Democratic socialism thus represents an attempt to reconcile the egalitarian goals of socialism with the institutions of liberal democracy. It envisions an economy where markets still allocate resources, but the ownership of productive assets and the distribution of wealth are subject to participatory and democratic decision-making. The goal is not to abolish markets, but to make them answer to the public, to ensure that economic outcomes reflect shared values rather than private power.

It is now well understood that capitalism grants prosperity to some while consigning many others to poverty. It denies the conditions for genuine human flourishing and development from vast segments of the world’s population, even within the most advanced economies. “Freedom of choice,” often celebrated by capitalism’s defenders as its central moral virtue, is in fact only partial. The stark inequalities of income, wealth, and opportunity that capitalism produces narrow what might be called “real freedom”: the genuine ability of people to pursue their life plans and act on the choices that truly matter to them.

The promise of democratic socialism is not simply greater equality, but greater freedom. Its goal is to give all people the ability to truly shape their own lives. That’s what Zohran Mamdani’s platform represents. His policies, such as a rent freeze, fare-free buses and universal childcare, are not merely economic measures; they are instruments of real freedom for ordinary people. When most of one’s paycheque disappears into rent, freedom is constrained. Housing stability helps people feel secure, make long-term plans, and avoid the stress of potential eviction. Housing stability is tied to human dignity. Fare-free public transit extends the freedom of mobility across the city. Free buses make mobility a right, not a privilege, and open up the physical and social space of freedom itself. And universal childcare liberates parents, especially women, from an impossible trade-off between childcare and participation in society. When the burden of childcare is shared by society, everyone gains the freedom to work, study, and engage in public life on equal terms. These policies redefine freedom not as the privilege of the few to accumulate without limit, but as the shared capacity of all to live with security, opportunity, and power over their own lives. That is the freedom democracy promises, and the one democratic socialism delivers.

Among capitalist countries today, the social democracies of the Nordic countries (Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Finland) come closest to the ideals of democratic socialism. A much stronger working class, and its insistence on a firm commitment to social welfare over the narrow interests of elites, has long distinguished these nations from other varieties of capitalism. Yet in social democracies, wealth inequality remains strikingly high, despite a more even distribution of income compared to the other parts of the developed world.

Mamdani’s election as mayor of New York City is a glimmer of hope that democratic processes can still serve the many rather than the few. His equity-centred platform, once dismissed as naive, won the confidence of a diverse majority yearning for justice and dignity. That victory, achieved in the face of relentless racism and Islamophobia, marks a collective triumph.

Yet elections are only beginnings. The hard work now lies ahead: translating promises into policy and hope into tangible change for a more humane and equal distribution of economic resources. The people have spoken; now it is time to deliver.

"Todd Snider, the influential alt-country singer-songwriter who created Americana hits such as Alright Guy, has died at 59.

His passing was shared through announcements on his official social media accounts. Although no cause of death was provided, his family shared on Friday that he had recently been hospitalized with pneumonia.

His record label posted a statement on social media, writing: “Aimless, Inc. Headquarters is heartbroken to share that our Founder, our Folk Hero, our Poet of the World, our Vice President of the Abrupt Change Dept., the Storyteller, our beloved Todd Daniel Snider has departed this world. Where do we find the words for the one who always had the right words, who knew how to distill everything down to its essence with words and song while delivering the most devastating, hilarious, and impactful turn of phrases?”

It continued: “He relayed so much tenderness and sensitivity through his songs, and showed many of us how to look at the world through a different lens. He got up every morning and started writing, always working towards finding his place among the songwriting giants that sat on his record shelves, those same giants who let him into their lives and took him under their wings, who he studied relentlessly. Guy Clark, John Prine, Kris Kristofferson, Jerry Jeff Walker.”

Snider had previously spoken openly about the chronic pain he endured because of spinal stenosis. Earlier this month, his team called off the remainder of his tour, reporting before a scheduled performance in Salt Lake City: “Todd sustained severe injuries as the victim of a violent assault outside of his hotel.”

Not long after, police said that Snider had been arrested for disorderly conduct. Body-camera footage circulated showing Snider telling officers he was in pain. When asked whether he was unhoused, he replied that he was “famous”, explaining that his band had left town after the show was canceled.

Salt Lake City police also told reporters they had no record of the assault described in the earlier press statement, according to Variety.

Born in Portland, Oregon, Snider headed to northern California after graduating high school, then drifted to Texas during the 1980s. There he crossed paths with Jerry Jeff Walker, who became an important mentor. By the 1990s, Snider had settled in Nashville, where he became a defining figure of the gritty east Nashville scene. His 2004 release East Nashville Skyline remains a cornerstone of the alt-country world.",literal
"Israel continues to hold 80 Palestinian doctors and medical workers from Gaza and 15 from the occupied West Bank.

More doctors and healthcare professionals are mobilising and calling for action to demand the release of Dr Hussam Abu Safia and at least 94 other Palestinian medics currently held captive by Israeli authorities.

On Monday, in an event organised by Healthcare Workers Watch (HWW) and Amnesty International UK, doctors and healthcare workers protested outside St Thomas’ Hospital in central London, calling for the immediate and unconditional release of all the detained healthcare workers currently held in appalling conditions in Israel.

The protest comes just days after an Israeli court extended Abu Safia’s arbitrary detention for another six months under the widely condemned Unlawful Combatants Law.

A further five healthcare workers have died or been killed while in Israeli detention, and five more are missing, their whereabouts unknown. According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, at least 1,722 healthcare workers have been killed in Israeli strikes in the past two years.

According to HWW, most healthcare workers were abducted by the Israeli military from their hospitals or ambulances while they were on duty. Testimonies collected by HWW and other organisations catalogue the torture and abuse that Palestinians endure in Israeli detention.

Dr Rebecca Inglis, of HWW, says: “Israel’s continued detention of nearly one hundred healthcare workers is in clear contravention of International Humanitarian Law. We are gravely concerned for their welfare given the extensive evidence that Palestinian detainees are being tortured while in Israeli detention.”

Who is Dr Hussam Abu Safia?

Abu Safia, the director of Kamal Adwan Hospital in North Gaza, was arrested by Israeli forces on December 27, 2024, after troops raided the hospital, which at the time was one of the last functioning medical facilities in the region.

Amnesty International says that the hospital director has been held without charge or trial under an Israeli security law.

Despite relentless bombardment and the tragic death of his own son in an Israeli air strike, Abu Safia remained on duty, caring for patients and leading his team through unimaginable conditions.

Since his detention, credible reports have emerged of torture, physical abuse and degrading treatment, including suffering significant weight loss and the denial of adequate medical care, hygiene and timely access to legal counsel – in clear violation of international law.

Israel’s systematic attack on Gaza’s health infrastructure

At least 94 percent of hospitals in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed, with many no longer operational. In addition to this, skilled doctors and healthcare workers have been killed, and paired with the detention of healthcare workers – most of whom were detained while working within hospitals and healthcare facilities – it has added to the immense pressure on Gaza’s vulnerable health system.

Between October 7, 2023, to October 20, 2025, HWW documented a total of 431 cases of detained Palestinian healthcare workers.

As of October 20, 2025:

309 of the 431 detained healthcare workers are now confirmed to have been released; of which 67 were released as part of the latest exchange deal on October 13

Five healthcare workers are still missing (three senior physicians, an UNRWA pharmacist and a senior physiotherapist)

Five HCWs have reportedly been killed or died in Israeli detention, however, their bodies have not been returned to their families.

HWW has said it has not yet received an update from the families of 22 detained healthcare workers, who are not included in the “confirmed detained” or “confirmed released” figures.

Who are the other healthcare professionals being held?

The healthcare professionals still detained by Israel have spent an average of 511 days in detention, with some held captive since the early weeks of the war.

Of the 95 being held, 80 are from Gaza, while the remaining 15 are from the occupied West Bank.

From Gaza alone, 31 nurses have been detained, followed by 17 physicians, 15 hospital support and management staff, 14 paramedics, two pharmacists and one medical technician. Twenty-five held senior positions, 50 occupied mid-level positions, while five were junior healthcare workers. All except one are male.

Most of the healthcare workers lived in North Gaza, with 36 of the prisoners from there, followed by 24 from Khan Younis, 18 from Gaza City and 3 from Rafah.

"Intimate and intriguing, Patti Smith's memoir offers new revelations

Random House

The publication date Patti Smith chose for her latest memoir, Bread of Angels, is not just happenstance: Nov. 4 is the day her husband Fred ""Sonic"" Smith died (in 1994), and the birthday of her comrade-in-arts, Robert Mapplethorpe (in 1946). Both men died in their 40s, ""the love of my life and the artist of my life,"" the celebrated punk rock star and author writes.

Bread of Angels is Smith's most straightforwardly autobiographical book to date. It touches on material she's written about before, but her focus this time is her trajectory from a working class childhood in Pennsylvania and south Jersey into her stage and recording career — which she put on hiatus during her marriage and reignited during her widowhood. The title Bread of Angels refers to the ""unpremeditated gestures of kindness"" Smith has experienced along the way, which color her essentially optimistic attitude toward life.

Sponsor Message

In the last 15 years, Smith has produced a tidy collection of small books that braid ruminations on her current endeavors with memories and photographs of her much-missed lovers and friends. The best is her National Book Award-winning Just Kids (2010), an extraordinarily resonant record of her relationship with Mapplethorpe. A Book of Days, in which she commemorates her journeys, personal touchstones, and the birth and death dates of her various heroes with evocative snapshots and brief appreciations, underscores her associations of people and memories with specific dates.

Smith credits her parents for a stable, nurturing childhood despite economic and health challenges. Her father, Grant Harrison Smith, returned to Philadelphia from active duty in New Guinea and the Philippines ""emotionally broken and plagued with malaria-induced migraines."" Jilted by his longtime girlfriend, he reconnected with Beverly Williams, whom he had known in high school. Their first three (of four) children came in rapid succession. Unable to complete his education, Smith's father worked the night shift in a union factory; her mother waited tables.

Smith, born in 1946, writes that she was a sickly baby whose ""Proustian childhood, one of intermittent quarantine and convalescence,"" was marked by numerous contagious diseases, but also by free-ranging fantasy play with her siblings, ""a visceral need to be free,"" and an early passion for books, shared with her mother.

In her first four years of life, Smith's family relocated 11 times, forced out of a series of condemned buildings. When she was 8, her parents bought a house in a lower-middle class development for veterans in rural south Jersey. Her Bible-reading father rejected organized religion, but her mother became an active Jehovah's Witness, taking her children with her to knock on doors. By her teens, Smith discovered her calling in music and art. When she was 15, she writes, ""The angels served a new portion; I discovered [the French poet] Arthur Rimbaud.""

Much of the material in Bread of Angels will be familiar to readers of Smith's prior memoirs, including recaps of her early years in 1960s and 1970s New York City. But she goes into more detail about her swift rise from poet to punk rocker, and the production of her first album, Horses, now celebrating its 50th anniversary. ""There was no plan, no design, just an organic upheaval that took me from written to spoken word,"" she writes. ""From solitude to collaboration ... One thing tumbled into another.""

Sponsor Message

Her account of her devotion to Fred Sonic Smith, for whom she cast off ""the mantle of fame and fortune"" and moved to Detroit, is unabashedly gushing. ""I knew instantly he would be my life. Such is the terrible mystery of love, that draws us from all that we know,"" she writes. Grounded by domesticity and children, she turned to writing, but struggled with ""characters in stories reluctant to be born, until I shook the cage of imagination, shocked them free to wreak havoc, gather wishes and trample time."" What's shocking here is the overwriting from the ordinarily pitch perfect Smith.

At points, the last third of Bread of Angels reads like quick notes for future biographers. But there are intriguing revelations, including the surprising discovery that Grant Smith was not her biological father — whose identity was uncovered with the help of the daughter she gave up for adoption when she was barely 20.

Smith's tally of her many losses in the 1980s and 1990s brings to mind the 19th century French writer Gustave Flaubert, who, after the deaths of several close friends, commented: ""My heart is becoming a necropolis."" Smith might relate. But her attitude is better reflected by her new book's upbeat epigraph, from another 19th century author, Nikolai Gogol: ""Obstacles are our wings."" Smith is a survivor who has made it her mission to ""leap back up"" and keep going after setbacks. Now approaching the end of her 70s, she has remained active — performing, touring, traveling and writing.

The tone of Bread of Angels veers between elegy and engagement. She mourns ""the worlds I knew, the hopes of my generation,"" yet celebrates ""the concentrative energy of a new idea emerging."" She concludes that her ""incandescent restlessness has somewhat quelled"" but that she hasn't changed much. Her latest project: ""the excruciating yet exquisite process of letting go.""

"Rosalía and sombr crack the top 10 on the charts for the first time

toggle caption Mike Coppola/Getty Images for MTV; Photo by Aldara Zarraoa/WireImage

Taylor Swift has the top album and song in the country yet again, as The Life of a Showgirl and ""The Fate of Ophelia"" hold down the No. 1 spots for a sixth consecutive week. But even as sombr and Rosalía hit new career highs, there's a major churn taking place just below the top 10, as Mariah Carey, Wham! and their cheerful ilk gear up for yet another jingling assault on the charts.

TOP STORY

Last week, the Billboard charts absorbed the full force of spooky season, as a weekend of Halloween parties produced a Hot 100 full of scary-ish songs and a return to the top 10 for Michael Jackson's ""Thriller."" At the same time, a different holiday began its annual attack on the chart, as two Christmas classics — Mariah Carey's ""All I Want for Christmas Is You"" and Wham!'s ""Last Christmas"" — made an auspiciously early return.

Sponsor Message

A week later, ""Thriller"" and their ilk have been sent back to molder in their crypts once more, while Christmas streamers who couldn't wait for Thanksgiving (you know who you are) have gone ham — and not in the seasonally appropriate, honey-glazed way — on the Hot 100. We should consider it a small win that none of them crash the top 10, but with ""All I Want for Christmas Is You"" at No. 11 and ""Last Christmas"" at No. 13, we're merely delaying the inevitable here.

""All I Want for Christmas Is You"" came this close to thwarting a major career milestone: As ""Back to Friends"" ticks up a spot to No. 10, sombr has become just the 10th artist to hit the Hot 100's top 10 for the first time in 2025. Another would-be first-timer came close this week, as country star Cody Johnson debuts on this week's chart at No. 12 with his cover of ""Travelin' Soldier."" The track, written by Bruce Robison and popularized by the act known at the time as The Dixie Chicks, has become a signature song for Johnson; his 2022 performance of ""Travelin' Soldier"" has accumulated 59 million views on YouTube, and now it's got a studio version to match. But if he's going to hit the top 10 for the first time in his career — this is his eighth time hitting the Hot 100 — he's probably gonna have to wait until January.

TOP ALBUMS

The Hot 100 isn't the only major Billboard chart to welcome a first-timer to its top 10: Spanish polymath Rosalía, whose 2022 album Motomami peaked at No. 33, blows away that career high as Lux debuts at No. 4. For an album that expands her sound well beyond chart-friendly genres — she recorded it with the London Symphony Orchestra — Lux wasn't necessarily an easy sell as a pop hit. Future weeks will tell the full story, of course, as an initial sales burst gives way to word of mouth and what will likely be a tsunami of placements on ""Best Albums of 2025"" lists.

The other top 10 debut is also a first-timer, but with an asterisk: Yeonjun, a member of the K-pop boy band Tomorrow X Together, lands at No. 10 with his first solo effort, No Labels: Part 01. Tomorrow X Together is a frequent visitor to the top 10, but Yeonjun now has a hit of his own.

There's one other serious chart breakthrough worth noting this week: After months of teasing and leaked tracks — and after entering the Billboard 200 albums chart at No. 173 last week — Paramore's Hayley Williams makes a huge jump with her new solo record, Ego Death at a Bachelorette Party. Buoyed by an official release and the addition of two new tracks, the album zips all the way to No. 12.

TOP SONGS

""All I Want for Christmas Is You"" and ""Last Christmas"" are just two of the nine holiday songs in this week's top 50, and the order in which they appear is instructive. Because, while it might seem as if the exact same holiday songs appear on each year's charts in roughly the exact same order, it's possible to plot out incremental shifts in audience preferences, year over year.

For example, there was a moment when Brenda Lee's ""Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree"" seemed to be overtaking ""All I Want for Christmas Is You"" — roughly around the time the still-living Lee released a video in 2023 for her 1958 hit. But in the time since, ""Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree"" has ceded its chart dominance to Mariah Carey and Wham!. This week, Lee re-enters the Hot 100 at No. 19, so that pecking order looks to persist in 2025.

Bobby Helms' 1957 staple ""Jingle Bell Rock"" follows at No. 20, re-entering alongside its sibling in the microgenre of ""holiday songs that evoke rock and roll without actually rocking."" Next up are the two most recently minted holiday standards, both of which have climbed steadily in recent years: Ariana Grande's 2014 hit ""Santa Tell Me"" at No. 30 and, from 2013, Kelly Clarkson's ""Underneath the Tree"" at No. 41. Their strength, relative to other holiday hits, appears to be growing.

Then, rounding out this week's holiday selections — remember that old, previously charting songs can only re-enter the Hot 100 if they're in the top 50 — are two gelatinous slabs of moldy fruitcake (Andy Williams' ""It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year"" at No. 47 and Michael Bublé's ""It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas"" at No. 48) and one gleaming gem (Nat ""King"" Cole's ""The Christmas Song"" at No. 50).

Bublé's strength and momentum, year over year, is especially notable and alarming: The Canadian singer has yet to hit the Hot 100's top 10 in his career, but he looks extremely well-positioned to do so this time around. (He's also got this week's highest-charting holiday album: Christmas, at No. 25.)

And, because the charts are kind of inherently a zero-sum game, there's a whiff of bad news for the Ives Hive. Burl Ives has been a staple of the top 5 — as recently as December 2024 — with his 1964 recording of ""A Holly Jolly Christmas."" But, at least so far, it's absent from this year's initial chart flurries.

The Ives Dive can only be blamed on one Scroogey scourge: Michael freaking Bublé, whose own take on the song debuted at No. 37 at the very beginning of this year. If Bublé becomes the new literal standard-bearer where ""A Holly Jolly Christmas"" is concerned, then that's bad news for 1) the estate of Burl Ives; and 2) everyone with taste. Justice for Burl!",figurative
"The US president, Donald Trump, has said “something good just may be happening” at the talks in Switzerland intended to end the war in Ukraine. European and Ukrainian negotiators have been attempting to “rework” the 28-point peace plan that the president put forward last week into one more favourable to Ukraine. Trump keeps signalling that he is willing to compromise, but his original plan put Ukraine in a very tough starting position, handing Vladimir Putin concessions that Russia has so far failed to gain on the battlefield.

It is true Russia has made recent advances – especially around Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad in Donetsk province, and in parts of Zaporizhzhia. And Ukraine lacks the troops and firepower to retake all the territory lost since 2022, let alone Crimea. But the Ukrainian army isn’t about to unravel, and neither is Putin close to fulfilling his original objective: conquering the four Ukrainian provinces of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. Russia fully controls only Luhansk. This war could drag on until the summer. By then, Putin’s forces will have fought Ukraine for as long as Stalin’s fought Nazi Germany.

Ukraine’s shortages are well known: too few soldiers to hold an 800-mile contact line and inadequate air defences after Trump severely cut direct US military assistance. Europe’s stepped-up support hasn’t compensated. What is remarkable, given Ukraine’s disadvantages, is the scale of Russia’s losses: more than 1 million casualties according to the UK Ministry of Defence, nearly 150,000 confirmed dead, and more than 23,000 pieces of equipment destroyed or damaged. Ukrainian deep strikes on Russian refineries – at least 17 by mid-November – have caused fuel shortages, long lines at petrol stations, panic buying, higher prices, rationing and a cut in refining capacity by up to a fifth.

It is in this context that Trump unveiled his peace plan – an early Christmas present for Putin. It was negotiated by Kirill Dmitriev, a Putin confidant and CEO of Russia’s $10bn sovereign wealth fund, and on the US side by Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner. The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, seems to have played a minimal role.

Witkoff and Kushner may be shrewd business negotiators, but they have scant diplomatic experience and even less knowledge of Ukraine. (Witkoff has recited Kremlin talking points after meeting Putin.) Their influence stems largely from personal ties to Trump. Pitting them against someone like Dmitriev virtually guaranteed a deal tilted toward Russia. A few examples illustrate the imbalance:

Ukraine – not Russia – is required to cap its armed forces at 600,000. Russia faces no comparable constraints.

Ukraine must amend its constitution to drop its commitment to joining Nato.

Russia had long expressed concerns about Nato expansion; President Boris Yeltsin objected in the mid-1990s, well before Putin took the helm. But acknowledging Russia’s concerns is different from claiming Ukraine’s Nato membership was imminent in 2022. Between Nato’s 2008 Bucharest summit – where it vaguely promised eventual membership – and the invasion, Ukraine made no concrete progress toward accession. Had Nato truly wanted Ukraine in, it could have moved swiftly, as it did with Finland and Sweden.

And that’s only the beginning. Trump’s plan recognises Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk as de-facto Russian – granting Putin parts of Donetsk he hasn’t captured. It freezes battle lines, allowing Russia to retain territory seized in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. The plan doesn’t give Putin everything, but it gives him enough to claim victory.

What does Russia concede? Virtually nothing. The plan does say frozen Russian assets will help rebuild Ukraine, but Moscow was never going to recover that money anyway.

Meanwhile, Russia receives further rewards: readmission to the G8; reintegration into the global economy; negotiations toward a staged lifting of sanctions; and cooperation with the US on energy, infrastructure, AI and rare earths. The plan also demands Ukrainian de-Nazification, validating Russia’s absurd narrative that Ukraine is riddled with Nazis – something any visitor can see is false.

Despite Russia’s ongoing war crimes – atrocities in Bucha, Irpin and Borodianka; forced relocations to Russia of children; repeated strikes on apartment buildings, most recently in the western city of Ternopil; and abuse, torture, and execution of Ukrainian prisoners of war – the plan grants the Kremlin full immunity from prosecution, negating international criminal court warrants for Putin and his top officials.

None of this should be surprising. Trump has been open about his admiration for Putin. He has been disdainful toward Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He has even blamed Zelenskyy for starting the war.

Some commentators, echoing Trump, argue that Ukraine’s war is futile and not a vital US interest. But that hardly justifies forcing Ukraine to accept a one-sided deal crafted without its participation – and accompanied by an ultimatum of mere days.

Other supporters of the plan insist, as Trump has, that it’s time to end the blood-letting, even as Israel’s strikes in Gaza continue during the ceasefire underwritten by Trump. Some who rightly criticise Israel’s conduct seem oddly indifferent to Russia’s war crimes.

Trump certainly has the authority to halt weapons deliveries to Ukraine – his decision to do so was another boon for Putin. But he has gone far further. By concocting a plan that may as well have been written in the Kremlin and excluding Ukraine from negotiations, he hasn’t just put his thumb on the scale. He’s put his hand on it. That’s morally indefensible and strategically myopic.

There is some positive news. After reports that Rubio told members of Congress the 28-point plan was produced by Russia, he held talks with Andriy Yermak, Zelenskyy’s closest adviser, to rework it based on Ukraine’s reactions – although Rubio has denied this. Trump accused Ukraine of ingratitude but added that the plan was “not my final offer” and that his deadline could be extended. If the upshot of all this is that Trump’s proposal doesn’t fly, that will be a good thing – above all for Ukraine.",figurative
"On November 10, the Ukrainian anticorruption authorities revealed that close associates of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy were allegedly involved in a scheme to embezzle $100m from Ukraine’s energy sector.

Zelenskyy’s business partner Tymur Mindich as well as two government ministers have been named so far in the investigation, led by the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU), an agency backed by Western governments. Ukrainian and Western media have suggested that the president’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, may also be implicated.

The way the investigation is revealing facts and identifying suspects – slowly, theatrically, strategically – smacks of a political campaign aimed at achieving specific political outcomes under the cover of an anticorruption drive.

The scandal has delivered a devastating blow to Zelenskyy’s international reputation and to the Ukrainian cause at large. The Ukrainian president is emerging out of it as a lame duck who will do what he is told by whoever is pulling the strings, which may be the administration of United States President Donald Trump.

One area in which there is already dramatic change is Ukrainian policy on talks with Russia. On November 11, British newspaper The Times ran a story on Deputy Foreign Minister Sergiy Kyslytsya, the man tasked with leading the negotiations, in which he made clear that engagement with Moscow was suspended because it was yielding no result. Just a week later, Zelenskyy announced he wanted to reactivate talks with Russia.

Then immediately, talk began of an emerging American peace plan that envisages Ukraine succumbing to all the key Russian demands for ending the war, if we are to believe media leaks. Despite a couple of defiant statements by Ukrainian officials, Zelenskyy didn’t reject it outright and promised to cooperate with the US. The corruption scandal has drastically limited his room for defiance.

What makes the prospect of peace more realistic today is that there is now a clear scapegoat for what essentially is Ukraine’s looming defeat – the Ukrainian president himself.

Indeed, the talks spearheaded by Trump earlier this year did not progress primarily because nobody wanted to take responsibility for an outcome that contrasts drastically with the expectations the cheerleaders of this war had built. While a military defeat today may mean salvation for Kyiv, it would be a deadly blow for war-mongering politicians and lobbyists who promoted the idea that Russia, a major nuclear power, could be coerced into accepting Western primacy by force.

That illusion underpinned the entire Western policy with regards to Russia throughout the conflict. It is the main reason why Kyiv resisted accepting an outcome of the war that the West was unable to change.

It has long been clear that Ukraine’s Western allies have hit a wall when it comes to military supplies and funding for Ukraine and sanctions against Russia. Nineteen packages of harsh sanctions against Moscow have failed to stop its army, which has grown only stronger and far more technologically advanced than it was at the start of the conflict.

Meanwhile, Ukraine has been struggling with draft dodging and territorial and human losses. It could reportedly run out of Western funding by April. Worse still, close European allies – like Poland and Germany – have indicated they are not ready to keep funding the large numbers of Ukrainian refugees they are hosting.

The appetite for more war with Russia is largely exhausted in Europe, but of course, no one wants to be blamed for reaching a much worse settlement than could have been achieved had this all-out war been avoided altogether.

Being blamed for a Ukraine defeat is not a huge risk for Trump, who has long dismissed this conflict as “Biden’s war”, accusing his predecessor President Joe Biden of starting it.

It is much harder for European leaders and Zelenskyy himself to accept it, given how invested they have been in the promise that Russia could be defeated on the battlefield.

To understand their predicament today, one needs to recall December 2019 when Zelenskyy met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Paris, and the two sides agreed on a ceasefire in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region, which ended hostilities and froze the front line over the next 12 months.

The war could have ended then on terms Kyiv could only dream of today. In particular, Ukraine would have retained its formal sovereignty over the Donbas region, only a part of which would have become a Russian-influenced autonomy. Ukraine would have lost the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia occupied and annexed in 2014.

But with the arrival of Biden to the White House in January 2021, Zelenskyy made a U-turn on the peace process, embarking on a strategy of pressing Russia on all fronts to coerce it into agreeing to better conditions for Kyiv.

He clamped down on Putin’s main political ally in Ukraine and launched a loud campaign for Ukraine’s accession to NATO while his Western allies tried to pressure Germany into stopping work on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, a major Russian export energy project. London also challenged Moscow by sending a battleship into the waters off Crimea, which Russia considers its territory. More than a year of dangerous brinkmanship ended with Putin unleashing an all-out invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

This year, Ukraine finally ditched its rightful but entirely unrealistic demands for a full Russian withdrawal and reparations in favour of a comprehensive ceasefire along the current front lines. It did so after having lost swaths of territory, a lot of infrastructure, 14,500 civilians and up to 100,000 military personnel.

A peace agreement on Russia’s terms would be extremely unfair to Ukraine and would indeed be against international law. But the only alternative to it is the country being sucked even deeper into the black hole of devastation and collapsing nationhood.

The reaction to the draft of the peace plan was the expected mix of virtue signalling, performative defiance and jingoism. It reflects the complete absence of a realistic plan that could improve Ukraine’s negotiating position. Conveniently though, the corruption within Zelenskyy’s entourage gives pro-Ukrainian cheerleaders in the West a way out that absolves them from responsibility for the deadly mess they helped create.

"The US government has been shut down for 30 days. Al Jazeera visualises where things stand right now.

The US government shutdown, which began on October 1 when Democrats and Republicans failed to agree on a funding bill, has now passed one month. Americans are increasingly facing delays and interruptions to their everyday lives.

Around 730,000 federal employees (32 percent of the federal workforce) have been working without pay, according to data from the Bipartisan Policy Center, while 670,000 have been furloughed – sent home without pay – because government departments can’t legally pay them. That number will go up as the shutdown drags on and government departments run out of money.

The shutdown has led to the disruption to or even full cessation of a number of services, including essential food assistance.

How long has the shutdown been going on?

In the lead-up to the shutdown in October, US President Donald Trump threatened to pursue mass federal layoffs after Democrats refused to approve a Republican-backed spending bill without key amendments that would restore funding for public health programmes.

Neither side backed down, resulting in the shutdown, which is now the second-longest in US history.

It has been rare for government shutdowns in the past to last for longer than a few days, but they do happen sometimes.

The last shutdown was during Trump’s first term as US president. Albeit only a partial shutdown, it was the longest in US history, lasting 35 days from December 22, 2018, to January 25, 2019. It was sparked by a row over the building of a wall along the border with Mexico and ended only when Trump announced a tentative deal with congressional leaders to reopen the government for three weeks while negotiations continued.

Since 1976, when the current process for setting and approving government budgets was established, the government has experienced 20 funding gaps, resulting in 10 shutdowns.

What happens during a shutdown, and which services are affected?

During a government shutdown, non-essential federal services such as national parks and museums, or regulatory agencies, are halted or reduced, and many government employees are furloughed – placed on unpaid leave.

Essential personnel – such as military service members, law enforcement officers, air traffic controllers, and agents for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) – are required to keep working, often without pay, until funding is restored.

How many people work for the federal government?

More than two million people are employed by the federal government across the US.

Just over seven percent (162,489) of all federal workers are based in Washington, DC, followed by 6.7 percent (150,679) in California, 6.5 percent (147,358) in Virginia, 6.4 percent (144,497) in Maryland and 5.8 percent (130,686) in Texas.

The locations of 276,235 employees are not publicly available.

How many are furloughed or working without pay?

According to the latest estimates from the Bipartisan Policy Center, some 730,000 federal employees are working without pay, while about 670,000 have been furloughed.

At the Department of Veterans Affairs, 97 percent of 462,000 personnel are still performing their duties. Most are being paid as most of the department’s funding does not come from annual appropriations – Congress-approved budgets.

About 95 percent of the Department of Homeland Security’s 271,000 employees are still working – most without pay – including Secret Service agents, immigration and border control officers, airport security, Coast Guard workers and emergency workers in disaster relief.

Some 90 percent of the Department of Justice’s 115,000 employees are still working – mostly without pay – including law enforcement, FBI agents, criminal prosecutors and prison guards.

Conversely, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has 91 percent of its 4,300 employees furloughed. Only those involved in monitoring markets and handling urgent fraud issues continue to work.

About 89 percent of the Environmental Protection Agency’s 15,000 workers have been furloughed. Security guards, criminal investigators and emergency response workers continue to work.

About 87 percent of the Department of Education’s 2,450 government staff have been furloughed. Those still working include workers distributing student aid and grants to schools.

What is the impact on federal programmes?

Come November 1, some essential government programmes will lose funding altogether.

The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) said on October 10 that it would have “insufficient funds” to pay food benefits by the end of this month.

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) – overseen by the USDA – will run out of funds by the end of this week. More than 42 million Americans rely on food assistance.

SNAP does have access to a $5bn contingency fund, which might sustain benefits for a few weeks – SNAP costs the federal government $99.8bn each year, or roughly $8.3bn per month. But, according to Reuters, the USDA will not use these for assistance that is set to lapse in November.

The Trump administration has said it will not use emergency funds to prop up the programme.

Also facing a lack of funding is the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), which provides food, breastfeeding support and education to more than six million pregnant women, young mothers and children.

What will the economic impact be?

The impact of a shutdown on the economy is usually temporary and not far-reaching. Furloughed and unpaid workers’ pay is generally backdated once a shutdown ends and funding is released.

However, that doesn’t mean it has no impact. Contracted workers tend to be worse affected than others, as these workers will only receive back pay if their contracting employers are able to provide it.

The Trump administration has also threatened not to provide back pay or to fire workers altogether, meaning this time around, the shutdown could affect the economy more.

According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the partial shutdown in 2018-19 reduced gross domestic product (GDP) growth by about 0.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018 ($3bn) and by about 0.2 percent in the first quarter of 2019 ($8bn). This was mainly due to the loss of furloughed workers’ pay and delayed spending on goods and services.

About $3bn of these losses were not expected to be recovered, so GDP in 2019 was estimated to be 0.02 percent lower than it would otherwise have been.

This time around, analysts estimate that the shutdown will shave 0.1-0.2 percentage points off GDP for each week that it carries on, which equates to about $15bn a week.

In a JPMorgan briefing note, economist Michael Feroli wrote: “The impact could be worse this time due to the threatened layoffs and actual job loss, which could create risks for the labour market and consumer spending.”

Without the release of economic data, which has been delayed by the shutdown, and with the continuation of the shutdown itself, the full impact remains unclear.",literal
"Lily King's new novel constructs an erotically charged love triangle

Simon & Schuster

Earlier this month, I kept picking up and putting down Lily King's new novel, Heart the Lover. I love King's writing but the opening section was hard for me to take — not in a grisly Cormac McCarthy or scary Stephen King kind of way — but in an ""Ugh, I remember being that girl, that age"" kind of way.

Heart the Lover opens in a college class of the 1980s. The professor, a man, is teaching 17th-century British literature and he's selected a student's essay — a creative piece — to read aloud. But, first, he holds up the essay to remark on ""its vulgar packaging"" — the fact that it's typed on ""neon-orange"" paper.

Sponsor Message

The embarrassed student-author is a young woman nicknamed ""Jordan."" She tells us that Halloween construction paper was all she had available when she was typing the essay on deadline. Here's how Jordan, decades later, will remember what follows:

“There are two smart guys in the class. They sit up front together .... The professor runs things by them so often I assume they’re his grad school TAs. When my essay gets passed back to me, they both turn to watch where it goes.



After that day, the copper-haired one [Sam] begins migrating back. Three classes later, he takes a seat beside me.



Soon he is walking me across campus ....



We talk exclusively about the class.



‘He’s not focusing enough on Cromwell,’ [Sam] says, ....



I agree. What else can I do? I am a mere student, and he is a scholar. That much is clear right away. ... And Sam isn’t even a grad student. He’s a senior, like me.



Later I go to the library and read about who Cromwell was, ...

Ugh. Now, young Jordan is no pushover — she's ambitious, putting herself through college on loans and waitressing jobs and she harbors a barely formed desire to be a writer. But her path will take longer to carve out.

Sponsor Message

The well-read bright boys, meanwhile, house sit and are invited to dinners by their male professors. They're the heirs apparent to the kingdom of books and ideas; Jordan's gifts are wrapped in the wrong packaging, just like her orange construction paper essay.

King's writing is so vivid, so immediate, that her opening sparked flashbacks of my own time in such classrooms, but sexism is just the way things are, not the subject of this intensely moving novel. Heart the Lover is both a prequel and a sequel to King's novel, Writers & Lovers, which made my ""best of the year"" list in 2020. ""Jordan"" is the nickname that those two clever college boys give Casey Peabody, who some of us readers have met already in Writers & Lovers.

In that earlier novel, Casey is older, a 31-year-old who's been waitressing and writing her first novel for over six years. Heart the Lover suggests a big reason why Casey would have been stuck in her 20s. But the structure of Heart the Lover is so ingenious, its emotional charge so compelling, you don't have to have read the earlier novel to be drawn into what's essentially a great triangular love story.

The young Casey (again, here nicknamed Jordan) is pursued by Sam and then by his best friend, the other star student in that classroom, a boy named Yash. The ""first love"" erotic energy between Jordan and Yash is off the charts and the two envision an artsy adult life together in New York. Yash, however, feels conflicted by his loyalty to Sam and by his need to safeguard his autonomy. Guess which way the seesaw tips and who gets crushed beneath?

I'll stop the plot summary there because readers deserve to experience for themselves the devastation of the final section of Heart the Lover, which takes place at a reunion of the now middle-aged trio in a dying man's hospital room. If you've ever lived through such a moment you'll appreciate how King renders the all of it: the banality of visitors' small talk; the unreal sense of melodrama, the sporadic awareness that a deadline for final conversations is approaching.

Heart the Lover is about screwing up, wising up, finding yourself and realizing what you may have lost in the process. To quote Elena Ferrante, another great chronicler of women's lives, Heart the Lover is also about the ""velocity with which life is consumed.""",figurative
"Trump claims ‘big progress’, but signs of discord from Russia persist as Putin aide Ushakov says revisions ‘unsuitable for us’.

European allies of Ukraine have given a cautious welcome to efforts to refine a United States peace proposal initially criticised for appearing to be weighted in favour of Russia’s maximalist demands.

The leaders of Germany, Finland, Poland and the United Kingdom were among those agreeing on Monday that progress had been made in the previous day’s talks between Washington and Kyiv in Geneva that yielded what the US and Ukraine called a “refined peace framework”.

Still, the European leaders stressed that work remained to be done.

“It was possible to clear up some questions, but we also know that there won’t be peace in Ukraine overnight,” said German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, adding that the peace plan initially drafted by the US had been “modified in significant parts”.

He welcomed the “interim result”.

“The next step must be that Russia must come to the table,” Merz said from Angola, where he was attending a summit between African and European Union countries. “This is a laborious process. It will move forward at most in smaller steps this week. I do not expect there to be a breakthrough this week.”

US President Donald Trump had blindsided Kyiv and its European countries last week with a 28-point peace plan criticised by some as a Russian wish list that called for Ukraine to cede more territory, accept limits on its military and abandon its ambitions to join NATO.

Britain, France and Germany responded by drawing up a counterproposal that would cease fighting at the present front lines, leaving discussions of territory for later, and include a NATO-style US security guarantee for Ukraine, according to a draft seen by Reuters news agency.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Monday that the peace plan now contained fewer than 28 points and incorporated “correct elements”, stressing that he would discuss “sensitive issues, the most delicate points” with Trump.

UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said that Ukraine’s allies in the “coalition of the willing” – a broad term for about 30 countries supporting Kyiv – will hold talks about the negotiations on Tuesday by video.

The German Foreign Office said that the chief diplomats of Germany, Finland, France, the UK, Italy and Poland consulted Monday with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha on further steps towards ending the war.

Also attending the summit in Angola, European Council President Antonio Costa said there was “new momentum” in negotiations.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the European Union would “engage further tomorrow with our partners from the coalition of the willing”.

‘Big progress’

On Monday, Trump indicated Sunday’s talks had gone well.

“Is it really possible that big progress is being made in Peace Talks between Russia and Ukraine??? Don’t believe it until you see it, but something good just may be happening,” the US president wrote on Truth Social.

Trump had given Zelenskyy, who is under the doubled pressure of Russia’s continued advance on the front line and a corruption scandal that has tainted his administration, until Thursday to agree to a framework to end the war. He also accused Zelenskyy of showing “zero gratitude” for peace efforts.

Still, The Ukrainian president welcomed Trump’s “constructive” approach on Monday.

Earlier that day, he said on X that Ukraine would “continue working with partners, especially the United States, and look for compromises that strengthen but not weaken us”.

Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk also said on Monday that negotiations were a “delicate matter” since “no one wants to discourage Americans and President Trump from having the United States on our side in this process”.

The Kremlin said it had not been informed of the results of the Geneva talks, but that it was aware that “adjustments” were made to the US proposal.

In a call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin repeated his view that the initial US plan could “serve as a basis for a final peace settlement”.

During the call, Erdogan said Turkiye was ready to support efforts to bring Russia and Ukraine together, including helping to facilitate direct talks between the two.

However, Russian presidential aide Yuri Ushakov said the European plan appeared “entirely unconstructive and unsuitable for us”, according to a report in the Russian state-run TASS news agency.

Reporting from Moscow, Al Jazeera’s Yulia Shapovalova said Russia was unlikely to accept the European revisions.

“If all Russian conditions and interests are not taken into account, Russia is ready to continue fighting because, according to Vladimir Putin, Russia is pretty successful on the battlefield and it wants to achieve its goals,” she said.

In comments made by video to a meeting at the Swedish parliament, Zelenskyy had indicated that territory would still be a key sticking point, accusing Putin of seeking “legal recognition for what he has stolen”.

Grim reality

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has decimated the east of the country, forcing millions to flee their homes, ravaging towns and cities, and killing tens of thousands in Europe’s worst conflict since World War II.

On Monday, the nearly four-year war continued to grind on, with Russian forces keeping up their deadly and devastating strikes on civilian areas while making battlefield advances in Ukraine’s southeastern Zaporizhia region.

Russian drones hit residential areas of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, overnight, killing four people and wounding 13, including two children, authorities said.

On Monday, Russian forces struck the city of Pavlohrad in Ukraine’s Dnipropetrovsk region with drones, wounding three people and damaging industrial facilities, according to regional authorities.

That morning, Russian shelling killed a 61-year-old woman in Kherson, according to the military administration of the city in southern Ukraine.

Zelenskyy said on Monday that it was in Russia’s interests to disrupt the peace process and warned Ukrainians to pay particular attention to air raid alerts in the days and weeks to come “as we fully understand who we are dealing with”.

Across the border, Russian air defences downed Ukrainian drones en route to Moscow, forcing three airports serving the capital to pause flights.

"On Wednesday afternoon, 374 bagpipers gathered in Melbourne’s Federation Square to play AC/DC’s It’s a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock’n’Roll), setting a new world record just up the road from where Bon Scott and the band famously played the song on the back of a flatbed truck riding up Swanston Street 50 years before.

It’s the one hit AC/DC no longer plays live, retired out of respect to Scott after his death in 1980. But you barely notice it is missing when their live shows are this stuffed with classics: an audible thrill ripples through the 80,000 punters in Melbourne Cricket Ground when AC/DC opens with If You Want Blood (You’ve Got It) then tears straight into Back in Black. Who else could play such a huge hit so early in a show? But Accadacca can, in what is essentially a greatest hits celebration that goes for more than two hours.

Let’s address the elephants in the room: yes, Brian Johnson is 78 and, no, his voice can’t reach the heights or hold out as long as it did in the 1980s. He can’t screech as he once could on songs like High Voltage or Highway to Hell, but he sure gives it a go with a smile on his face. Johnson was forced to leave AC/DC’s 2016 world tour because of severe hearing loss (Axl Rose stepped in) but a fix was found and you can tell he’s happy to be back, cackling like a gremlin between songs. (Accadacca doesn’t do stage banter, and no one minds.)

Likewise, Angus Young – still wearing his schoolboy shorts at 70 – is noticeably slower on certain early tracks, including the frenetic opening to Thunderstruck. But it is still Thunderstruck, and who cares when a whole stadium is singing that loudly, that joyfully, as one?

With his shock of white hair and skinny legs poking out of his shorts, Young simultaneously looks like an ancient wizard and confusingly childlike; when he trots back to the band at the end of a song, he looks like a lost little boy running for his parents – until he launches into a frenzied solo, his fingers moving almost too fast to see. He can still duckwalk the length of a huge stage, wild-eyed and juddering around as though he’s been electrocuted.

He slowly loses clothes during the set, even using his tie like a violin bow to play his guitar. By the end, when his shirt is almost completely unbuttoned, he’s in charge of the whole show.

On Let There Be Rock, Young launches into a lengthy, indulgent and hugely entertaining guitar solo that almost feels like a challenge to any who thought AC/DC weren’t still up to it. The rest of the band fades away as Young struts, taking breaks only to revel in the cheers before throwing himself on the floor and rolling around like a man possessed. “Where did that come from?” Johnson asks afterwards; who could say?

Johnson and Young are our ringleaders but they have tight support in the rhythm guitar of Stevie Young, who officially came onboard in 2014 after his uncle Malcolm was diagnosed with dementia; as well as the bassist, Chris Chaney, and the drummer, Matt Laug, who plays with the determination of a man trying to trigger an earthquake. Your eardrums won’t be the same again.

2:00 Watch 374 bagpipe players break a world record with AC/DC tribute – video

Though the tour is named for the 17th album Power Up, released in 2020, they only play one song from it. Instead, we get the best of rest: Shoot to Thrill, High Voltage, Highway to Hell, You Shook Me All Night Long, Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap, TNT and Whole Lotta Rosie. There’s even room for a surprise with Jailbreak, a song they have not played live since 1991, which is welcomed with huge enthusiasm.

This is AC/DC’s first show in Australia in 10 years and Melbourne is their first stop – after all, it is the band’s “ancestral homeland”, as Johnson puts it, being “the home of Mr Scott”. It’s hard not to suspect this may be the band’s last world tour, and maybe even their last trip to the homeland – but what a thrilling spectacle it is if you can get a ticket. They rock and we salute them.",figurative
"At least four families have sued infant formula maker ByHeart saying their babies contracted botulism from contaminated formula, as the company faces ongoing scrutiny from federal investigators and a separate class action lawsuit filed last week.

In the lawsuits, affected families described harrowing days or weeks in the hospital with their babies, who were placed on IVs and feeding tubes. Many said they had chosen ByHeart’s formula because it contained organic whole milk and minimal additives, making it seem like the healthiest option.

The company said in a statement Wednesday that laboratory tests had identified Clostridium botulinum spores in samples of its formula. ByHeart told NBC News that it could not comment on pending litigation and that “the company is focused on the recall and root cause investigation at this time.”

According to the Food and Drug Administration, 31 infants who consumed the formula have suspected or confirmed botulism. The cases span 15 states, and all have required hospitalization. No deaths have been reported.

The bacteria that causes botulism can grow in foods that aren’t properly canned or preserved, and it produces a toxin that attacks the nerves. The resulting illness can cause difficulty breathing, muscle paralysis or death.

ByHeart said on its website that it has not identified the root cause of the contamination but has shared its test results with the FDA.

“We immediately notified the FDA of those findings, and we are working to investigate the facts, conduct ongoing testing to identify the source, and ensure this does not happen to families again,” it said.

In an interview with NBC News, Hanna Everett said she started giving ByHeart formula to her daughter, Piper, at around 2 months old. By early this month, Piper was constipated and drooling excessively, and her left eye seemed droopy, Everett said. A friend sent her a link to the ByHeart recall.

“Sure enough, the can she had just finished that day was the exact lot number that was affected,” said Everett, who lives in Richmond, Kentucky.

Piper was admitted to a children’s hospital on Nov. 9, where she was diagnosed with botulism. Everett said the sight of doctors and nurses struggling to administer IVs and a feeding tube made her throw up.

Two friends had to physically prop her up, she said, “because I was just bawling.”

“They’re holding your child down that’s not even 4 months old technically at the time, and she’s just screaming bloody murder. And there’s nothing you can do,” Everett said.

Piper was given a botulism antitoxin via an IV drip. The treatment isn’t readily stocked at hospitals, so it had to be flown in. Everett said Piper’s condition has improved; she was released from the hospital roughly a week ago.

But Everett is still wracked with guilt.

“It feels like I let her down when I know that’s not the case. It’s hard to tell yourself that as a mother, because you’re going to blame yourself,” she said.

Everett and her husband, Michael, sued ByHeart last week, seeking damages for medical expenses, pain and suffering.

“It makes me more angry and just sick to my stomach that it took them as long as it did to own up to this,” she said. “It’s almost like too little, too late.”

Everett said she messaged ByHeart about the recall while Piper was in the hospital, and it offered to send her more formula cans.

Darin Detwiler, a professor of food regulatory policy at Northeastern University, agreed that ByHeart should have taken comprehensive action more quickly.

“They should have identified this on their own, and they should have been forthcoming immediately,” he said.

After the FDA alerted ByHeart to the potential link between its formula and the botulism outbreak, the company initially recalled just two lots. The following day, ByHeart posted on its website that there was not enough evidence to link its product to the illnesses because a sample that had tested positive for botulism bacteria came from an opened can, which “can be contaminated in multiple ways.”

In court filings, parents suing ByHeart have described states of terror.

In the latest suit, filed on Wednesday, a Washington state couple said their daughter had chronic constipation, difficulty feeding and extreme fatigue while taking the formula. She was admitted to the emergency room at 2 months old, the filing says.

The family left the hospital on Wednesday, according to the suit. The mother, Madison Wescott, said she doesn’t produce enough milk to satisfy her daughter’s needs without formula.

“Knowing that I can’t fully feed my child, and I can’t trust formula companies has really taken a toll on our family,” Wescott said in the suit.

In California, Anthony Barbera and Thalia Flores exclusively fed their son ByHeart formula after he was born, according to their lawsuit. By the time their son received the antitoxin for botulism at the hospital, he was no longer eating, connected to multiple IV lines and too weak to cry, their lawsuit says.

Arizona parents Stephen and Yurany Dexter said in their lawsuit that their daughter stopped eating altogether in August, refusing the bottle of formula as soon as it touched her lips. She was transported by air ambulance to a children’s hospital. The couple said they feared she might die or never recover fully.

Bill Marler, a lawyer representing the Dexters, Wescotts and Barbera and Flores, said ByHeart has “a lot to answer for.”

“If there’s a product that should be safe, it should be infant formula,” he said.

Before this, no botulism outbreaks had ever been linked to infant formula in the U.S. Formula makers aren’t required to regularly test for Clostridium botulinum, but they must follow sanitary control practices to prevent contamination and are subject to FDA inspections.

Most of the major formula recalls in recent years — including the 2022 Abbott Nutrition recall, which contributed to a national formula shortage — were because of potential contamination with a different bacteria, Cronobacter sakazakii. ByHeart also recalled batches of its formula in December 2022 because of possible Cronobacter contamination.

In 2023, the FDA sent a warning letter to ByHeart describing “significant violations” at its manufacturing facility in Pennsylvania. The FDA said that ByHeart attributed a batch of formula that tested positive for Cronobacter to a laboratory error, though the lab denied that that was the case. The agency also said there were two water leaks at the facility, and that ByHeart did not evaluate a potential link between the leaks and formula that later tested positive for Cronobacter.

ByHeart’s website states that it “undertook action to address the issues and there are no open issues from that warning letter.” The Pennsylvania facility was not involved in the production of formula in the current recall, the company said.

Abigail Snyder, an associate professor of microbial food safety at Cornell University, said an FDA warning letter like the one ByHeart got is “pretty unusual,” though there was increased regulatory activity around infant formula after the Abbott recall.

“Fewer ingredients and whole milk is a different attribute than microbial safety, unfortunately,” she said.",literal
"Jimmy Cliff, the legendary musician who expanded the popularity of reggae around the world, has died, his family announced Monday on his official Instagram account.

He was 81.

""It’s with profound sadness that I share that my husband, Jimmy Cliff, has crossed over due to a seizure followed by pneumonia. I am thankful for his family, friends, fellow artists, and coworkers who have shared his journey with him,"" his wife, Latifa Chambers, wrote on Instagram.

He was best known for songs including ""Many Rivers to Cross"" and ""The Harder They Come,"" the title song for the movie of the same name from 1972, which featured Cliff. The film's soundtrack was a major international success and helped spread the appeal of Jamaican reggae.

Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness said in a statement: ""His music lifted people through hard times, inspired generations, and helped to shape the global respect that Jamaican culture enjoys today.""

Tributes poured in from the musical world, including many from artists whom Cliff inspired.

""A true foundation, a pillar of our music, and one of the first to carry reggae out into the world,"" Ali Campbell, of the British reggae group UB40, said on X.

Born in Jamaica in 1944, Cliff scored his first local hit at age 14 with ""Hurricane Hattie"" and would go on to win two Grammy awards and pick up seven nominations.

He was only one of two Jamaicans to be inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, alongside Bob Marley. He was inducted in 2010, with an introductory speech by Wyclef Jean. An essay commemorating Cliff by writer Rob Bowman said that if he had done nothing but star in ""The Harder They Come,"" he would have merited inclusion.

Cliff was a foundational figure in the Jamaican reggae scene. He worked as an A&R man, discovering new talent for Beverley's Records. The legendary label promoted ska, rocksteady and eventually reggae and played a role in the discoveries of both Desmond Dekker and a young Bob Marley.

A prolific artist well into later life, Cliff collaborated with a string of non-reggae musicians, including the Rolling Stones and Paul Simon. At the same time, the likes of Bruce Springsteen and Willie Nelson have recorded versions of his songs.

Bob Dylan declared Cliff's song ""Vietnam"" the ""greatest protest song ever written,"" according to Cliff's website.

After a creative resurgence in 2012 with the Grammy-winning album ""Rebirth,"" Cliff said, according to his website: ""Now, I feel I have not completed what I’m here on this planet to do. I have to say what I have to say and do what I have to do via music and films. Every morning I wake up, that keeps me going.""",figurative
"Opinion: Susan Stamberg gave NPR its voice

toggle caption Barry Thumma/AP

We are here — and I mean on the air with you today — because of Susan Stamberg. There are of course others who helped turn the idea of National Public Radio into a distinctive sound. But a little over 50 years ago, when Susan's voice began to crackle into kitchens and cars all over America, the people who heard her didn't ask, ""What's NPR?"" but, ""Who is that?""

She was the first woman to co-host a nightly news broadcast, and she didn't sound like a sonorous news anchor. Susan sounded irreverent, not official. Boisterous, not boring. She was courteous, and often hilarious.

Susan Stamberg gave NPR a voice, and that laugh that could make microphones tremble.

We saluted Susan at NPR — and on this show — when she retired last month. I'm glad she got to hear at least a portion of our gratitude and love before she died this week at the age of 87. Those of us who work here know we stand atop the partnership that Susan and a few other scrappy journalists began more than 50 years ago, with what has become millions of listeners across America.

I've been trying to recount all I learned from Susan over the years.

She often reminded me that the most important thing you can do in an interview is to listen. Journalists often try to plot out extensive questions in advance, packed with pertinent facts. But sometimes we're so eager to get through our questions we neglect to really hear the answers and respond to them.

""You've got to be prepared to let all that prep hit the floor,"" Susan once told me, ""and let the interview go someplace else.""

She also showed us how the best questions can be as short as, ""Why?"" Or as ingenuously simple as when Susan asked an orchestra conductor, ""Don't your arms ever get tired?""

And Susan showed us all that for a news program to become a companion in people's lives, it has to try to play all the notes in the human symphony, high and low; dark and light; and you play them with style. You can pack all the important facts into a story and a show, but if you don't hold the interest of listeners, they won't stay with you long enough to hear any of it.

"President Donald Trump signed an executive order Monday afternoon launching a new federal effort to supercharge American artificial intelligence research, development and scientific applications.

Unveiling the new “Genesis Mission” to support American efforts on AI, the order charts out a series of steps to expand computational resources, increase access to vast federal datasets and move toward impactful, real-world applications, particularly in scientific fields.

“The Genesis Mission will dramatically accelerate scientific discovery, strengthen national security, secure energy dominance, enhance workforce productivity, and multiply the return on taxpayer investment into research and development,” the order states.

Michael Kratsios, assistant to the president for science and technology and director of the Office for Science and Technology Policy, will lead the effort.

Monday's order describes the Genesis Mission as ""comparable in urgency and ambition to the Manhattan Project.""

Among other measures, the order charges Secretary of Energy Chris Wright with establishing a new “American Science and Security Platform” to centralize the infrastructure required for the new push. According to the order, the platform will focus on providing researchers with the computing power and datasets necessary to train AI models.

“The Genesis Mission will build an integrated AI platform to harness Federal scientific datasets — the world’s largest collection of such datasets, developed over decades of Federal investments — to train scientific foundation models and create AI agents to test new hypotheses, automate research workflows, and accelerate scientific breakthroughs,” the order reads.

The order opens the door to significantly increased public-private partnerships on AI development: within 90 days, the secretary of energy must identify systems and data available to support the program, including “resources available through industry partners.”

AI systems require immense datasets in order to learn how to represent the real world. With its vast troves of information about Americans and their activities, the federal government has an enviable, but often decentralized and disorganized, gold mine of data untapped by AI companies to date.

Monday’s order targets these barriers to data-sharing, giving Kratsios the responsibility to integrate “appropriate and available agency data and infrastructure into the Mission.”

With increased computing resources and access to data, AI should then be applied to practical and critical scientific issues within 270 days, the order states. These areas of “science and technology challenges of national importance” include advanced manufacturing and robotics, biotechnology and nuclear fission and fusion.

Keegan McBride, a senior policy advisor at the Tony Blair Institute and an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, said the announcement was significant.

“AI has the potential to transform the entire scientific, research, and discovery pipeline. This represents a strong signal from the U.S. to the world about what is possible,” McBride told NBC News.

Monday’s announcement builds on the existing National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource (NAIRR). The NAIRR was created in 2020 by the National Artificial Intelligence Initiative Act of 2020 to provide a shared, robust national research infrastructure to “accelerate AI and AI-powered discovery and innovation.”

The NAIRR started as a pilot program, bringing together a coalition of federal agencies, ranging from the Department of Defense and NASA to the National Institutes of Health, and nongovernmental organizations like OpenAI, Google and Palantir, to set up a nationwide research community.

Lynne Parker, who co-chaired the NAIRR task force as deputy chief technology officer of the U.S. under President Joe Biden and is now associate vice chancellor emerita at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, said federal support for AI research is pivotal to future progress.

“Government support for AI research builds the foundation for new breakthroughs and helps keep innovation aligned with the public interest,” Parker told NBC News. “We take for granted that new products appear regularly but seldom consider the decades of research that made them possible.”

“Without long-term investment, we risk ceding leadership in the technologies that will define our economy, our security, and our daily lives,” she said.

The Trump administration’s AI Action Plan, released in July, emphasized the role of national research and development efforts, partially stemming from the NAIRR, “to foster the next generation of AI breakthroughs.”

Monday’s executive order came weeks after the federal government announced new partnerships with some of America’s leading AI companies to build the next generation of AI-focused supercomputers.

At the end of October, the U.S. Department of Energy announced a new partnership with AMD to launch two new supercomputers at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, home to some of America’s leading federal AI researchers.

“Winning the AI race requires new and creative partnerships that will bring together the brightest minds and industries American technology and science has to offer,” Secretary Wright said at the time in a statement.

“Working with AMD and HPE, we’re bringing new capacity online faster than ever before, turning shared innovation into national strength, and proving that America leads when private-public partners build together,” Wright said, referencing Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s role in building the supercomputers.

At the beginning of November, the Department of Energy announced further plans to expand Oak Ridge’s Leadership Computer Facility with high-powered Nvidia chips to tackle complex quantum-computing and AI-focused research.",literal
"BANGKOK — A woman in Thailand shocked temple staff when she started moving in her coffin after being brought in for cremation.

Wat Rat Prakhong Tham, a Buddhist temple in the province of Nonthaburi on the outskirts of Bangkok, posted a video on its Facebook page, showing a woman lying in a white coffin in the back of a pickup truck, slightly moving her arms and head, leaving temple staff bewildered.

Pairat Soodthoop, the temple’s general and financial affairs manager, told The Associated Press on Monday that the 65-year-old woman’s brother drove her from the province of Phitsanulok to be cremated.

He said they heard a faint knock coming from the coffin.

“I was a bit surprised, so I asked them to open the coffin, and everyone was startled,” he said. “I saw her opening her eyes slightly and knocking on the side of the coffin. She must have been knocking for quite some time.”

According to Pairat, the brother said his sister had been bedridden for about two years, when her health deteriorated and she became unresponsive, appearing to stop breathing two days ago. The brother then placed her in a coffin and made the 300-mile journey to a hospital in Bangkok, to which the woman had previously expressed a wish to donate her organs.

The hospital refused to accept the brother’s offer as he didn’t have an official death certificate, Pairat said. His temple offers a free cremation service, which is why the brother approached them Sunday, but was also refused because of the missing document.

The temple manager said that while he was explaining how to get a death certificate when they heard the knocking. They then assessed her and sent her to a nearby hospital.

The abbot said the temple would cover her medical expenses, according to Pairat.",literal
"Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban and his very large team of ministers, propagandists and members of the country’s well-connected economic elite flew to Washington on November 7 to meet President Donald Trump, the first bilateral meeting of the two leaders since his return to power. The trip itself was unprecedented in its scale and unusual because of its historical context. A veritable spectacle.

Trump has been pressuring Orban to align with his sanctions on Russian fossil fuels and purchase more American LNG. Trump’s hardening stance towards Russia was a blow to Orban, who has positioned himself as Trump’s closest ally in Europe, ostracised by Western liberals yet on good terms with Moscow and Washington. Initially, his gambit seemed to pay off, as Trump sought a quick end to the war in Ukraine by offering concessions to Russia.

Over time, the classic foreign policy bureaucracy seems to have regained influence and pushed back against Trump’s inner circle around Putin. The latest sanctions and intensified military cooperation signal this shift. Foreign policy discussions in Budapest over the past few weeks have centred on the question of whether, and for how long, Orban can avoid these sanctions and continue buying Russian oil. Thus, the stakes of the meeting were high.

A pyrrhic victory for Orban

The details of the announced deal are still somewhat murky. Orban presented the outcome as a blanket exemption, but Secretary of State Marco Rubio contradicted this, stating that the waiver lasts only one year, while United States officials have flagged to reporters that it has not yet been formalised and remains a verbal understanding. Either way, the imminent threat of financial havoc has apparently been postponed until after the elections in April. Trump also amplified Orban’s misleading messaging about the difficulties of eliminating the country’s dependence on Russian oil. Furthermore, the politicians put the proposed Trump-Putin meeting in Budapest back on the agenda.

Even with all the uncertainties, the deal represents a victory for Orban. He could leverage his American ties and symbolic capital, has another chance to portray himself as a politician punching far above his weight in international politics, and kept Russian oil and the flagship Hungarian energy company’s profits flowing.

However, this is a pyrrhic victory. Costly beyond Orban’s gifts and promises to Trump and his economic commitments made in Washington. And these commitments are not negligible. They range from buying American nuclear fuel – which itself represents a U-turn in Hungarian energy policy that will require a thick skin to sell to a Hungarian audience that has been fed a narrative of no alternative to Russian involvement in Hungarian nuclear energy – to buying US military equipment and liquefied gas.

Orban continues to trade concessions such as procurement and policy alignment for external lifelines rather than building endogenous capacity. However, the real costs are deeper and can be found in three dimensions: moral political costs, economic dependence, and a costly illiberal ecosystem.

The moral and political costs

First, the American green light to Hungary’s continued dependence on Russian fossils has serious moral and political costs. Orban has no qualms about cosying up to war criminals. Still, his ties with Putin carry moral costs at a scale that has profound political implications.

Today, Slovakia and Hungary are the only European Union countries still receiving oil from Russia, with the Hungarian oil giant MOL Group playing a significant role in Slovakia’s energy sector. After Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, Hungary increased its share of Russian oil imports by 25 percentage points to 86 percent in 2024. Importing Russian oil is profitable for Hungary, allowing for relatively low energy prices, a key pillar in Orban’s illiberal playbook.

It took significant campaigning to convince part of his electorate that Putin is a good guy who makes reduced energy prices possible and protects white Christian conservatism against the “self-sabotaging” “Islamo-communist” West. Most Hungarians are still pro-EU, and appearing as Russia’s Trojan horse is electorally costly. Furthermore, Orban’s Putinism isolated him even among illiberal allies from Warsaw to Rome. Budapest signalled on November 14 that it will challenge the EU’s planned 2027 phase-out of Russian energy, further deepening the political consequences of Orban’s alignment with Moscow.

The exhaustion of Orbanomics

Second, the price Hungary pays for Russian oil is not only measured in roubles flowing East but in euros lost from the West. Despite all the economic nationalist chest-beating, Hungary remains heavily dependent on foreign capital and EU funds. Throughout the 2010s, Orban could get away with his shenanigans in Europe, aided and abetted by mainstream conservatives. Escalating corruption in Hungary and finally Budapest’s doubling down on pro-Russian foreign policy manoeuvres even after the invasion of Ukraine hardened European elites against Orban. Orbanomics emerged as an illiberal response to the internal contradictions of liberal globalism.

Yet, it failed to create a sustainable economic alternative, failed at industrial upgrading and improving domestic capacities, while deliberately repressing wage growth to maintain the country’s cost competitiveness in its low-value assembly platform economy. The “Eastern Opening” gamble also failed to replace Western markets and capital. The political-economic exhaustion of Orbanomics has intensified the Hungarian economy’s external vulnerabilities. One of those vulnerabilities is the loss of EU funds.

A one-year US waiver on Russian oil and gas eases the immediate energy squeeze and props up Orban’s energy politics, but it doubles down on the country’s core weakness: an externally wired, shock-prone model with thin domestic upgrading, wage repression and dependence on foreign monetary goodwill. Hence, continuing to maintain close ties with Putin undermines the country’s economic future.

The architecture of illiberal power

Third, the ties and symbolic capital Orban could leverage in Washington did not appear out of thin air. He was among the first to grasp that for the illiberal right, seizing the state was not enough. Real power requires dismantling liberal hegemony. From 2010 onwards, he launched a counter-hegemonic project aimed at remaking the state, civil society and culture in the service of an alternative order. This project soon reached beyond Hungary’s borders: a small state cannot sustain such ambitions alone.

Orban, therefore, sought to embed Hungary’s transformation within an international illiberal ecosystem, forging ties above all with US national conservatives. Over the past decade, Hungary has poured substantial resources into cultivating these links. Trump and his intellectual circle, in turn, treat Hungary as an illiberal laboratory to justify assaults on higher education, media, civil society and democratic institutions. Orbanism and Trumpism are twin expressions of a deliberate, tectonic revolt against the liberal world order, hence the depth of their ideological bond. Hungary is a “unique island in an ocean of liberalism,” as Orban said after he met with Trump.

Yet their mutual admiration conceals a costly reality: a taxpayer-funded network of foundations, consultancies and media platforms circulating people, ideas and strategies across the illiberal ecosystem. The pyrrhic victory in Washington in November 2025 was the product of this illiberal counter-hegemonic machinery, whose costs are measurable in hundreds of millions of dollars. Yet the same network that delivers symbolic wins and temporary policy concessions also binds Budapest to Trump’s transactional asks.

Rescuing illiberalism?

Thus, the costs of the Trump-Orban deal are significant and manifold. Orban’s request was granted, but it does not fix Hungary’s political-economic vulnerabilities. Nevertheless, Orban achieved a significant short-term victory that could even influence the outcome of the upcoming election next April. With the country’s economy in shambles, averting the financial costs of the sanctions gives Orban’s government a lifeline. It makes some room for pre-election measures to improve Orban’s favourability ratings. These steps allow for the minimising of the costs of the exhaustion of Orbanomics.

Staying in power will require reframing the election so that Orban can reap the domestic benefits of his illiberal international ties. This wouldn’t be a small feat in a politically and linguistically tightly closed country. Nevertheless, in contrast to saving the sinking economy, this foreign policy reframing is feasible before the election. If Trump were to gift Orban a visit in Budapest and maybe even a “peace summit” with Putin, then that could save his loyal Hungarian friend’s political future.

"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said Friday that he’s “not threatening death” toward a group of Democratic members of Congress whom he accused of committing “seditious behavior,” which he said a day earlier was “punishable by death.”

“In the old days, if you said a thing like that, that was punishable by death,” Trump said in an interview Friday on conservative Brian Kilmeade’s radio show when asked to clarify what he meant.

The president's latest remarks come after he lodged the accusation and warning Thursday after Democratic lawmakers, many of whom are veterans, released a video urging members of the military and intelligence community not to follow illegal orders.

Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, who previously worked at the CIA and Defense Department, on Tuesday shared the video of herself and other former members of the military and intelligence community.

“This administration is pitting our uniformed military and intelligence community professionals against American citizens. Like us, you all swore an oath to protect and defend this Constitution. Right now, the threats coming to our Constitution aren’t just coming from abroad but from right here at home. Our laws are clear. You can refuse illegal orders. You must refuse illegal orders,” they said. “No one has to carry out orders that violate the law or our Constitution.”

The other participants included Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Reps. Chris Deluzio of Pennsylvania, Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire, Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania and Jason Crow of Colorado.

Trump responded to their video message in multiple posts on Truth Social, including one where he said, “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!” He also reposted other posts such as one that said, “Hang them George Washington would.”

The president denied that he threatened the members of Congress: “I think they’re in serious trouble. I would say they’re in serious trouble. I’m not threatening death, but I think they’re in serious trouble. In the old days, it was death. That was seditious behavior.”

Asked to respond to Trump's latest comments Friday, Slotkin's office referred to remarks she made Thursday night on MS NOW, saying that she received threats instantaneously and Capitol Police told her she'd be put on 24/7 security.

""We’ve got law enforcement out in front of my house,"" she said. ""It changes things immediately. And leadership climate is set from the top. And if the president is saying you should be hanged, then we shouldn’t be surprised when folks on the ground are going to follow suit and say even worse.""

Crow said in a statement Friday evening that ""Trump's Truth Social posts threatening to execute Democratic Members of Congress speak for themselves.""

“No matter his attempts to silence and intimidate me, I will not back down from my lifetime oath to uphold and defend the Constitution,” he said.

Kelly, Deluzio, Houlahan and Goodlander didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment in response to Trump’s assertion Friday that he wasn’t threatening death.

Trump said that the lawmakers who appeared in the video “broke the law,” and added, “I can say if I ever said that and there were a Democrat as president, all hell would have broken loose. And it has broken loose.” The president said that he believes Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is investigating the situation.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt rejected the idea Thursday that the president was calling for members of Congress to be executed. “No,” she said when asked that question, later adding that the Democrats’ comments are “a very, very dangerous message and it perhaps is punishable by law. I’m not a lawyer. I’ll leave that to the Department of Justice and the Department of War to decide.”

Threats and violence against public officials have surged in recent years, including the two attempted assassinations of Trump while he was campaigning for president last year. A recent NBC News poll found that more than 6 in 10 registered voters said they thought “extreme political rhetoric” contributed in the September assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., who said Thursday he wouldn't have used the same language as Trump, was asked Friday about the rise in threats against people serving in elected office and whether Trump has a responsibility to tone down the heated rhetoric.

“I don’t think you can put the blame on the president for any of that,” Johnson told reporters. “The rhetoric is heated all the way around. We’ve had Democrats throughout this Congress who have in essence encouraged political violence against the president himself, against Republicans. I’ve been calling on people to turn down the rhetoric across the board, everywhere, throughout the institutions. It’s a dangerous time.”

Crow, who served in the Army, told reporters on Capitol Hill on Friday that he was receiving more threats since Trump’s posts. His office has formally requested that the U.S. Capitol Police investigate the president’s posts, referring to them as “intimidating, threatening, and concerning,” according to a copy of the email reviewed by NBC News.

“I write to report threats made by the President of the United States, Donald J. Trump, against Congressman Jason Crow,” Crow’s office begins the email, which outlined the Truth Social posts and said his offices have received “a significant uptick in calls and emails with violent rhetoric and additional threats.” Axios first reported the letter. Capitol Police doesn’t typically comment on potential investigations, but requesting a probe into the sitting president is a long shot.

“You know, when the president of the United States tweets out death threats and says the things that he says that, you know, that stirs things up a lot,” Crow said Friday. “But again, I’m not going to be incredibly intimidated, and certainly not going to change my approach.”

Sen. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., who served in the Marines, told NBC News he has seen an uptick in online vitriol since the president's comments on sedition.

“Clearly the president knew exactly what he was doing, trying to turn his online digital mob against these members of Congress,” he said in an interview Friday, while in Chicago to talk to small businesses about the impact of recent immigration operations.

“The fact is that, what they’re [Democrats are] saying is very much what you do when you join the military. ... You should not follow any orders that are illegal, very simple,"" he added. ""And the fact that he took it so personally tells you, tells me he just didn’t understand the military. He thinks that they’re his toy. They’re not there to protect the Constitution United States.”",literal
"Diaries and a gift from actor Carrie Fisher are among the personal items from Marianne Faithfull that are going up for auction in London.

The musician died in January aged 78, leaving behind a cache of fascinating portraits, photographs and ephemera from a glamorous, sometimes troubled life. “Each piece tells a story and reflects her spirit and inimitable taste,” her son Nicholas Dunbar said. “It is time now for these belongings to find new homes and I hope that they will bring as much joy to their new owners as they did Marianne.”

The diaries include one from 1959 when Faithfull was in her early teens, and a 1989 journal entitled Goals. Artworks include a print by South African artist Marlene Dumas with the inscription “Say it in Broken English”, a reference to one of Faithfull’s most iconic lyrics; Babylon, a work on paper by Anita Pallenberg, who was in Faithfull’s social circle alongside the Rolling Stones; and Abductee, a collage by Australian pop artist Martin Sharp.

Furniture from the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries is up for sale, along with items from Faithfull’s wardrobe, including a Louis Vuitton by Marc Jacobs black wool coat.

A trunk belonging to Fisher and gifted to Faithfull is expected to sell for between £1,000 and £1,500.

The singer and actor were “very, very close” according to the singer Rufus Wainwright, who paid tribute to Faithfull in the Guardian after her death. “I had several wild evenings seated between them, kind of along for the ride. They were completely classic, original legends, who seemed to live in a universe all their own, and it was very decadent, incredibly funny and totally rock’n’roll.”

Faithfull became an icon of swinging-60s London, with pop hits including As Tears Go By and an acting career with roles opposite the likes of Orson Welles and Alain Delon. She was a muse to the Rolling Stones and co-wrote the song Sister Morphine, which she recorded and was covered by the Stones on Sticky Fingers.

But she became addicted to cocaine and heroin, and spent some years homeless in London, before getting clean in the 1980s and rebuilding her music career, going on to record with artists including Nick Cave, Damon Albarn and Metallica.

The auction items are on view at Bonham’s in Knightsbridge as part of their Sound & Cinema auction, which will run until 3 December. The auction house’s pop culture specialist Rebecca Anthony heralded Faithfull as “a cultural icon with an exceptional sense of style and lasting legacy, we are delighted to bring items from her personal collection to auction for the first time”.",figurative
"The pressure building on Ukraine is not just diplomatic.

While President Donald Trump pushes for a quick resolution, the churning mud of the battlefield has produced only slow and painstaking gains for the Kremlin during the four years since its full-scale invasion.

From the front-line city of Pokrovsk in eastern Donetsk to Zaporizhzhia in the south and the northern region of Kharkiv, there is little doubt that Russia is making advances.

President Vladimir Putin has urged Ukraine to surrender key territory at the negotiating table — as Washington has suggested — or face Moscow's military taking it by force anyway. Trump has echoed this sentiment, warning that Ukraine ""will lose in a short period of time"" if it does not agree to the deal he has backed.

But battlefield monitors suggest the picture is not quite so bleak for Ukraine as Trump and Putin suggest.

Russia's gains are slow and incremental, won at a heavy cost against Kyiv’s overstretched army, according to these mostly Western observers, who see Moscow as overstating its position for diplomatic gain in negotiations with Washington.

Pokrovsk, a transit hub that has been the center of the fighting for months, could soon hand the Kremlin its first major capture in two years.

Yet, Russia would not be able to take the rest of Donetsk ""without significant casualties, probably in the hundreds of thousands,"" Chris Parry, a former NATO commander and rear admiral in the British Royal Navy, told NBC News in an interview. If Ukraine gives that up in a deal, it ""will leave the rest of the country vulnerable to a strike anytime that Putin wants to come back,"" he said.

Indeed, since Aug. 15, Russia has has been advancing at ""foot pace,” gaining just 3½ square miles a day, according to an analysis Sunday by the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington think tank.

In all, Russia has occupied only an additional 1% of territory since November 2022, war-watchers agree. Most of the 20% of Ukraine that Russia controls is made up of land seized by Russian-backed fighters after 2014, and the illegally annexed Crimean Peninsula.

Assuming it can keep up even this crawl, Russia would not capture the rest of Donetsk until at least August 2027 “and likely even longer,” the Institute for the Study of War said. And Putin is pressuring Ukraine to hand over this territory, not because it truly is a fait accompli, but merely “to save Russia significant amounts of time, effort, manpower, and resources,"" it said.

On the flip side, not even Ukraine's most ardent supporters could claim that its position is easy. Could it survive the Russian advance if it wasn’t coming under U.S. pressure to capitulate?

“That’s the million-dollar question,” said Michael A. Horowitz, a Jerusalem-based geopolitical consultant. “We’re in a battle of attrition, and both sides are paying a very high cost to defend or capture smaller and smaller areas.”

Pokrovsk is “on the verge of falling into Russian hands,” said Horowitz, who follows the conflict in minutiae.

That would allow Russian troops to turn their attention north to the “fortress belt” of Druzhkivka, Kramatorsk, Slovyansk and Kostyantynivka, a defensive line of cities that Kyiv has spent years reinforcing.

Giving Donetsk to Russia would hand over these cities anyway.

Ultimately, few Ukrainians believe this would be the end of the Kremlin’s aggression. Rather, it would give Russia a potent foothold in the heart of the country, from which it might be able to add to its history of broken ceasefires and diplomatic promises.

Ukrainian troops have for more than a year defended Pokrovsk. Now, most are pinned down in their positions, unable to move because of loitering Russian drones, and only resupplied by robotic tracked vehicles controlled remotely.

Further northeast up the Donetsk front line, Russia claimed its forces had captured a string of villages, including Yampil.

Meanwhile, in Zaporizhzhia, Russia has likely captured 15 villages since September, the Black Bird Group, a Finnish open-source intelligence agency, told The Kyiv Independent on Sunday.

Last week, both sides traded familiar claims and denials of Russian victory in Kupiansk, in the eastern Kharkiv region, which Russian commander Sergei Kuzovlev told Putin was a “key cog in Ukraine’s defenses.”

As of last Thursday, the general staff of the Ukrainian military said it was still under its control, deriding Russian ""propaganda"" that was “solely aimed at concealing the critical losses of the Russian army.""

NBC News could not independently verify the battlefield accounts from either side.

Putin has used these claims of victory to threaten Ukraine and Europe.

He warned in a speech Friday that if Ukraine rejects Trump’s peace efforts, “then both they and the European warmongers should understand that” the Kremlin’s recent victories will “inevitably be repeated in other key parts of the front.”

“It may not happen as quickly as we would like, but inevitably it will happen,” he said.",figurative
"From streets to supermarkets, global boycotts for Gaza have grown as a fragile ceasefire holds for now.

Protests to end Israel’s mistreatment of Palestinians are getting louder and larger.

Seeing the livestreamed genocide Israel perpetrated in Gaza has had an effect globally, with the call to boycott Israel at an all-time high.

Quiet boycotts, which started in supermarkets nearly two decades ago, have turned into widely used apps that help millions make choices about purchases.

Campus protests and encampments in the US and Canada have led some major education institutions to cut ties with Israeli counterparts, while investments into Israel have dipped, and some of the world’s largest economies have recognised Palestine as a state.

Dr Mohammed Mustafa is a Palestinian Australian doctor whose parents left their native Deir el-Balah in central Gaza decades ago in search of a better life.

He volunteered in Gaza’s hospitals over the past two years and has shared it all on social media, including his visits to Gaza, attending conferences and advocating for Palestinians.

He says the experience of watching a genocide livestreamed has changed many people.

“For years, Palestinians have felt like we were shouting into a void. Now, to see people across continents marching, creating art, and demanding justice – it gives you hope that the world’s conscience is finally waking up.

“When I was younger, I never imagined this level of global solidarity… Seeing that tide turn now … it’s deeply moving. It feels like truth is finally finding its voice,” he continues.

Nearly 50,000 pro-Palestine protests in two years

In recent months, pro-Palestine protests have seen a noticeable uptick – between May and September 2025, they increased by 43 percent compared with the five months prior.

Over the past two years, there have been at least 49,000 pro-Palestinian protests across 133 countries and territories, according to the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED).

The highest number of pro-Palestine demonstrations was recorded in Yemen (15,266), followed by Morocco (5,482), the US (5,346), Turkiye (2,349), Iran (1,919), Pakistan (1,539), France (1,397), Italy (1,390), Spain (1,102) and Australia (967).

The map below shows the locations of the 49,000 pro-Palestinian protests held between October 7, 2023, and October 3, 2025.

The growth of a boycott

Israel has grown increasingly isolated, the founder of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement, Omar Barghouti, told Al Jazeera.

BDS launched in 2005 to advocate for Palestinian rights and end Israel’s occupation and apartheid through targeting complicity, not individuals, he said.

Barghouti is from a Palestinian family that is deeply involved in politics and culture. Among the famous Barghoutis is Fatah leader Marwan Barghouti, who is serving out several life sentences in an Israeli prison.

“The BDS movement has played the most important role in exacerbating the isolation of Israel’s regime of settler-colonialism, apartheid and now genocide,” Barghouti said.

Barghouti noted that even the chairman of the Israel Export Institute, Avi Balashnikov, had admitted to challenges in global trade.

Balashnikov, at the Mind the Tech Conference 2024, said: “Economic boycotts and BDS organisations present major challenges, and in some countries, we are forced to operate under the radar.”

“BDS has achieved this impact by channelling the immense grief, rage and solidarity expressed by tens of millions worldwide into strategic, nonviolent, and very effective boycott and divestment campaigns,” Barghouti adds.

The BDS movement has identified numerous companies that are considered complicit in Israel’s occupation, human rights violations, or apartheid policies.

Their campaigns are divided into three main groups:

Priority boycott targets: Companies and institutions with a proven record of complicity in Israeli apartheid and occupation. The BDS movement calls for a complete boycott of these brands.

Companies and institutions with a proven record of complicity in Israeli apartheid and occupation. The BDS movement calls for a complete boycott of these brands. Pressure targets : Companies that BDS actively pressures through boycotts (when alternatives exist), lobbying, peaceful protests, social media campaigns, and strategic legal actions.

Organic boycotts: Grassroots campaigns started by local communities, which BDS supports because of the boycotted brands’ complicity in Israel’s actions against Palestinians.

How are people boycotting?

Sumayya Rashid*, a 45-year-old expat mother living in the United Arab Emirates, has been teaching her 11-year-old daughter about what Palestinian children are experiencing and explaining to her how buying certain brands indirectly supports the genocide.

“We no longer buy anything from McDonald’s, KFC, Pizza Hut or Carrefour. These were brands that we would consume before the boycott,” says Rashid, adding that they have found local replacements where possible.

Rashid says her daughter is immersed in Palestinian culture because of school and the community around it.

“She may not understand the extent of the genocide, but she does know we can’t be supporting Israel as they are the instigators of the violence.”

Rashid has found that it is easy to find alternatives in the UAE, but she relies on the Boycat app to double-check any items she is not sure about.

Boycat is one of several mobile apps launched over the past years to help consumers identify products targeted for boycott – it has partnered with the BDS movement, which helps keep its list up to date and ensure it follows BDS goals.

Across the Atlantic, in Toronto, Canada, is 26-year-old Jaspreet Kaur*, who feels there are some restrictions on speaking openly in support of Palestine in Canada.

“Palestine brought a lot of things into perspective for a lot of us. It’s just even looking down at your cup of morning coffee, and seeing this is such a core need, a necessity, which is a sheer luxury.

“Kids can’t play in the street without the fear of being bombed – that’s something I never have to think about,” says Kaur.

“I don’t remember the last time I had Starbucks or McDonald’s, or used Airbnb or booking.com,” she says adamantly.

Kaur says she has boycotted as much as possible, using apps to guide her, but that some consumer items from multinationals have crept back into her life due to budget constraints.

Beyond her personal shopping choices, Kaur has found it difficult to be vocal about supporting Palestine while working in corporate finance.

“I don’t go to as many protests as I would like to, I’ve taken off my Palestinian phone case and removed the Palestinian flag from my Instagram bio, I can’t be as loud as I need, as I want to personally,” she says.

As an immigrant waiting for her citizenship, Kaur says she feels her actions and thoughts on Palestine are not so accepted publicly and at work.

What has the boycott’s effect been?

Boycotts have not only affected the bottom lines of several companies complicit in Israel’s occupation but have also led to investments being pulled out of Israel and international embargoes on it, increasing economic and political pressure.

In November 2024, French retailer Carrefour closed all its stores in Jordan.

BDS has long highlighted Carrefour’s business ties with Israeli firms in illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank.

The company also exited Kuwait, Oman, and Bahrain, its locations being reopened as HyperMax, a local grocery chain launched by regional franchisee, Majid Al Futtaim.

The closures are seen as a major win for the movement, demonstrating the power of consumer-led campaigns on multinational corporations.

Two of the largest US food and beverage chains, McDonald’s and Starbucks, have felt the effect of boycotts, facing declining sales and reputational backlash, particularly across the Middle East and other Muslim countries like Malaysia and Indonesia.

During an earnings call in January 2024, McDonald’s Chief Executive Officer Chris Kempczinski said the fast food giant had seen a “meaningful impact” in several markets.

Starbucks reported three consecutive quarters of global sales declines, with revenue down 2 percent for the year 2024.

In September, the giant announced plans to close dozens of US outlets and lay off some 900 employees as part of a $1bn restructuring initiative to reverse declining performance.

Divestments, sanctions, and diplomatic measures

In September, the Spanish government cancelled a weapons deal with Israel worth nearly 700 million euros ($815m). Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez had previously announced an upcoming law banning military trade with Israel, which came into effect on October 9.

In 2024, Norway’s pension fund and France’s AXA divested from Israeli assets linked to settlements.

Ireland, Denmark, and the Netherlands’ pension funds also withdrew investments in Israeli-linked companies, including Caterpillar, Expedia, and TripAdvisor, due to concerns over human rights violations and involvement in illegal Israeli settlements.

In June, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Norway and the United Kingdom formally sanctioned far-right Israeli ministers Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich for “incitement of violence” against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza.

In the same month, Ireland, Slovenia and Spain called for the suspension of the EU-Israel Association Agreement.

Sweden has also asked the European Council to adopt sanctions “against Israeli ministers who promote illegal settlement activities and actively work against a negotiated two-state solution”.

For a Palestinian witnessing the turning of the global tide, Mustafa says he feels the movement for Palestine has become “one of the most dynamic social justice movements of our time”.

“It has brought together people from every background – faith-based, secular, Indigenous, and global – uniting them under a shared demand for human dignity.

“Because of that, I believe the Palestinian movement will shape how future struggles for justice are fought and understood,” he said.

UN monitoring

The UN Office of Human Rights, since 2020, has maintained a database of companies that are profiting from Israel’s illegal settlement enterprise in the occupied West Bank.

In its September 2025 update, it listed 158 firms operating inside settlements deemed unlawful by the International Court of Justice.

While nearly 90 percent of the companies are Israeli, the list also includes multinationals registered in Canada, China, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, the UK and the US.

These include well-known companies like Airbnb, Booking.com, Expedia, Motorola, Re/Max and TripAdvisor.

"“Wicked: For Good” didn’t need magic to shatter box office records.

The highly anticipated sequel to the first “Wicked” is now the No. 1 film at the domestic box office, hauling in an estimated $150 million domestically and $226 million worldwide this weekend.

The film had the biggest-ever opening weekend for a Broadway adaptation, beating out its predecessor, which opened to $112.5 million almost exactly a year ago. It also achieved the second-highest opening weekend of the year, just behind “A Minecraft Movie,” which raked in $163 million when it debuted in April.

Paul Dergarabedian, head of marketplace trends at box office data company Comscore, said he was impressed that “Wicked: For Good” outpaced “Wicked” at the box office, noting there’s never a guarantee that sequels of popular movies will perform to expectations.

“That doesn’t always happen,” he said. “It’s a testament to how much audiences around the world love ‘Wicked,’ these stars and just the way these movies are presented on the big screen.”

Dergarabedian attributed much of the film’s success to the marketing push from Universal Pictures — including a range of product partnerships, themed experiences and viral press moments from Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo — that have turned Universal Pictures’ “Wicked” franchise into a cultural event.

(NBC News and Universal Pictures share Comcast as a parent company.)

Movie theaters this weekend were decked out in pink-and-green popcorn tins and drink cups, with some even offering “Wicked”-themed photo-ops for viewers. Online, fans shared videos of themselves dressed in Elphaba- or Glinda-inspired outfits as they headed to the theaters.

The second installment of the two-part film series takes on slightly darker tones than the fluffier first movie, exploring Elphaba’s exile as the Wicked Witch of the West while Glinda, now living a glamorous life as the Good Witch, wrestles with complicated feelings about their friendship.

“Wicked: For Good” opened to a 95% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes, as well as an A on Cinemascore. Dergarabedian said he expects the film, which debuted right ahead of Thanksgiving weekend, to have long-term playability going into the holidays.

“This isn’t just a one-weekend wonder,” Dergarabedian said. “This is a film that’s perfectly tailored for audiences over the next six weeks, heading all the way to New Year’s Eve and beyond.”

He predicts the film will help fuel one of the biggest-ever Thanksgiving weeks for movie theaters, along with the upcoming Wednesday release of “Zootopia 2.”

After a quiet October, he said, “Wicked: For Good” is kicking off the momentum for a slew of potential end-of-year box office hits, including “Five Nights at Freddy’s 2” on Dec. 5, as well as “Avatar: Fire and Ash” and “The SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants” on Dec. 19.",literal
"President Donald Trump said Monday that he will travel to Beijing in April and host Chinese President Xi Jinping for a state visit later in the year.

Trump announced the plans after a call with Xi on Monday, which came weeks after a meeting in South Korea at the end of October.

""Our relationship with China is extremely strong!"" Trump wrote on Truth Social. ""Now we can set our sights on the big picture. To that end, President Xi invited me to visit Beijing in April, which I accepted, and I reciprocated where he will be my guest for a State Visit in the U.S. later in the year.""

The travel plans come after the Trump administration detailed a trade deal framework with China that renewed soybean purchases from China and loosened China’s export restrictions on rare earth minerals, two commitments that are pending full compliance from China.

The call focused on the Russia-Ukraine war, fentanyl and agricultural products like soybeans, a major U.S. export, Trump said.

Trump spoke with Xi for about an hour Monday, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, who said that “it was a very positive call” that largely focused on a trade deal the United States is working out with China “and those relations and how they are moving in a positive direction.”

Chinese state media said the call centered on Taiwan, which Trump said was not discussed last month at their most recent in-person meeting. Xi told Trump on Monday's call that “Taiwan’s return to China is an integral part of the post-war international order,” according to Chinese state media.

While he was in South Korea visiting with Xi in October, Trump said that he would head to China in April and that Xi would make a trip “some time after that,” to either Florida or Washington, D.C.",literal
"Portland Trail Blazers head coach Chauncey Billups on Monday pleaded not guilty to a two-count federal indictment accusing him of participating in a brazen scheme to rig underground poker games backed by the Mafia.

Billups is charged with wire fraud conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy.

Judge Ramon Reyes set bond at $5 million, secured by Billups’ home in Greenwood Village, Colorado. The conditions of his bond package dictate that he cannot have contact with witnesses, victims, co-conspirators or co-defendants.

He also cannot gamble or associate with any members of organized crime.

Billups was surrounded by reporters and cameras as he left the federal courthouse Monday alongside his attorney, his wife and one of his daughters.

The arraignment was followed by a status conference for 31 of his co-defendants in the alleged cheating case, dubbed “Operation Royal Flush” by federal investigators.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Gibaldi told the court that his office has already started plea discussions with several of the defendants.

The government continues to collect materials from the defendants, including documents, photos, records from searches, cell phone content and iCloud information that totals one terabyte of data.

The case is so sprawling that prosecutors suggested breaking it up into three groups of defendants — but several defense attorneys immediately shot down that proposal. Reyes, for his part, said he wants the defendants to be tried together for now.

Reyes also dismissed defense attorneys’ suggestion that the complex case could take years to go through the legal system, saying he wants to move it along and begin the trial by next September. He told the room of attorneys to “do what you have to do.”

The defendants are accused of participating in a scheme to rig ritzy card games in Manhattan, Las Vegas, Miami and the Hamptons. The suspects allegedly used high-tech cheating gadgets to steal millions of dollars from games backed by four of the Mafia’s “Five Families.”

Billups, a former NBA player and 2004 NBA Finals MVP, allegedly played the role of “Face Card” — a high-profile person who could help attract big-fish gamblers. He was arrested on Oct. 23.

The NBA put Billups on immediate leave after the charges were announced. “We take these allegations with the utmost seriousness, and the integrity of our game remains our top priority,” the league said in a statement.

Billips has not coached since Oct. 22, the night before he was indicted.

The next hearing is set for March 4 at 2 p.m. ET.",figurative
"Shedeur Sanders became the first Browns rookie quarterback to win his first NFL start since 1995 on Sunday and he’ll get a chance to make it two in a row in Week 13.

Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski announced on Monday that Sanders will start against the 49ers. It will be Sanders’ first home start.

Sanders moved into the starting lineup because Dillon Gabriel suffered a concussion in the team’s Week 11 loss to the Ravens. Stefanski said that Gabriel has cleared the concussion protocol, but the team is sticking with Sanders after their 24-10 win over the Raiders.

Sanders was 11-of-20 for 209 yards, a touchdown and an interception. The touchdown came when running back Dylan Sampson broke free for a 66-yard score on a screen pass and Sanders set up another touchdown with a 52-yard strike to rookie wideout Isaiah Bond.",literal
"This year’s UN climate talks in Brazil’s Belém ended without a major breakthrough. The text of the final agreement lacked a deal to shift away from fossil fuels, delayed crucial finance and the “mutirão” decision contained no roadmap to halt and reverse deforestation. But the multilateral system at Cop30 held together at a point when its collapse felt close. This ought to be a warning: next year’s conference of the parties must strike a better bargain between the rich and poor world.

Developing countries are far from united on some issues. Over rare earth minerals China sees any move as targeting its dominance, while Africa sees it as essential for governance. Elsewhere petrostates did not support Colombia’s call for a fossil fuel phase-out. Yet the global south broadly coheres around a simple principle: its nations must be equipped to survive a climate emergency they did not create. That means cash to build flood defences, make agricultural systems resilient, protect coastlines and rebuild after disasters strike. They also demand front-loaded finance to transition to clean, green economic growth.

But climate finance is a hard sell in the global north. Rightwing populists in the west rail against cash being spent on climate and foreigners. Any issue that fuses the two becomes a difficult political terrain. Then there is the broader geopolitics – one in which spiky confrontations have become the norm. For parts of the rich world, clean industrialisation of the global south isn’t a priority – it’s an economic threat.

Donald Trump did not send a team to Brazil, the first time since 1995 America was not officially represented at the annual climate summit. This may not have been entirely unwelcome. The US, which owes the largest climate debt in the world, has blocked meaningful finance deals for years – and its reshoring agenda is designed to keep key industries at home. This is not entirely without logic: some analysts say China is the proof that the west has reason to fear too rapidly empowering poorer nations.

But such a narrow worldview will only hinder progress. As Evans Njewa, chair of the Least Developed Countries (LDC) group, stated bluntly after Cop30 ended, Belém was missing ambition. For him the world’s most vulnerable countries came seeking protection; they left with promises postponed. Yet the disappointment felt today is a spur for greater action tomorrow. The LDCs are looking to Cop31 in Turkey and, ultimately, to Cop32 in Ethiopia to change minds.

This year’s UN adaptation report could not be clearer: the scale of the task ahead is vast. Developing countries, it suggests, require more than $310bn per year by 2035 – yet they received only $26bn in 2023, down from $28bn the year before. Needs are rising faster than finance. The UN warns that without a dramatic course-correction the poorest countries will be left exposed to heatwaves, wildfires and floods.

The urgency of the crisis explains why African negotiators are so insistent that adaptation finance must be from the state, preferably in grant form. To imagine otherwise, they say, is delusional; currently private finance makes up only 5% of adaptation cash and most of that is philanthropic. Private capital will not build sea walls, restore mangroves or protect subsistence farmers. Cop30 underscored a simple reality: only by moving beyond symbolism and self-interest can the world secure its future.",literal
"The US president, Donald Trump, has said “something good just may be happening” at the talks in Switzerland intended to end the war in Ukraine. European and Ukrainian negotiators have been attempting to “rework” the 28-point peace plan that the president put forward last week into one more favourable to Ukraine. Trump keeps signalling that he is willing to compromise, but his original plan put Ukraine in a very tough starting position, handing Vladimir Putin concessions that Russia has so far failed to gain on the battlefield.

It is true Russia has made recent advances – especially around Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad in Donetsk province, and in parts of Zaporizhzhia. And Ukraine lacks the troops and firepower to retake all the territory lost since 2022, let alone Crimea. But the Ukrainian army isn’t about to unravel, and neither is Putin close to fulfilling his original objective: conquering the four Ukrainian provinces of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. Russia fully controls only Luhansk. This war could drag on until the summer. By then, Putin’s forces will have fought Ukraine for as long as Stalin’s fought Nazi Germany.

Ukraine’s shortages are well known: too few soldiers to hold an 800-mile contact line and inadequate air defences after Trump severely cut direct US military assistance. Europe’s stepped-up support hasn’t compensated. What is remarkable, given Ukraine’s disadvantages, is the scale of Russia’s losses: more than 1 million casualties according to the UK Ministry of Defence, nearly 150,000 confirmed dead, and more than 23,000 pieces of equipment destroyed or damaged. Ukrainian deep strikes on Russian refineries – at least 17 by mid-November – have caused fuel shortages, long lines at petrol stations, panic buying, higher prices, rationing and a cut in refining capacity by up to a fifth.

It is in this context that Trump unveiled his peace plan – an early Christmas present for Putin. It was negotiated by Kirill Dmitriev, a Putin confidant and CEO of Russia’s $10bn sovereign wealth fund, and on the US side by Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner. The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, seems to have played a minimal role.

Witkoff and Kushner may be shrewd business negotiators, but they have scant diplomatic experience and even less knowledge of Ukraine. (Witkoff has recited Kremlin talking points after meeting Putin.) Their influence stems largely from personal ties to Trump. Pitting them against someone like Dmitriev virtually guaranteed a deal tilted toward Russia. A few examples illustrate the imbalance:

Ukraine – not Russia – is required to cap its armed forces at 600,000. Russia faces no comparable constraints.

Ukraine must amend its constitution to drop its commitment to joining Nato.

Russia had long expressed concerns about Nato expansion; President Boris Yeltsin objected in the mid-1990s, well before Putin took the helm. But acknowledging Russia’s concerns is different from claiming Ukraine’s Nato membership was imminent in 2022. Between Nato’s 2008 Bucharest summit – where it vaguely promised eventual membership – and the invasion, Ukraine made no concrete progress toward accession. Had Nato truly wanted Ukraine in, it could have moved swiftly, as it did with Finland and Sweden.

And that’s only the beginning. Trump’s plan recognises Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk as de-facto Russian – granting Putin parts of Donetsk he hasn’t captured. It freezes battle lines, allowing Russia to retain territory seized in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. The plan doesn’t give Putin everything, but it gives him enough to claim victory.

What does Russia concede? Virtually nothing. The plan does say frozen Russian assets will help rebuild Ukraine, but Moscow was never going to recover that money anyway.

Meanwhile, Russia receives further rewards: readmission to the G8; reintegration into the global economy; negotiations toward a staged lifting of sanctions; and cooperation with the US on energy, infrastructure, AI and rare earths. The plan also demands Ukrainian de-Nazification, validating Russia’s absurd narrative that Ukraine is riddled with Nazis – something any visitor can see is false.

Despite Russia’s ongoing war crimes – atrocities in Bucha, Irpin and Borodianka; forced relocations to Russia of children; repeated strikes on apartment buildings, most recently in the western city of Ternopil; and abuse, torture, and execution of Ukrainian prisoners of war – the plan grants the Kremlin full immunity from prosecution, negating international criminal court warrants for Putin and his top officials.

None of this should be surprising. Trump has been open about his admiration for Putin. He has been disdainful toward Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He has even blamed Zelenskyy for starting the war.

Some commentators, echoing Trump, argue that Ukraine’s war is futile and not a vital US interest. But that hardly justifies forcing Ukraine to accept a one-sided deal crafted without its participation – and accompanied by an ultimatum of mere days.

Other supporters of the plan insist, as Trump has, that it’s time to end the blood-letting, even as Israel’s strikes in Gaza continue during the ceasefire underwritten by Trump. Some who rightly criticise Israel’s conduct seem oddly indifferent to Russia’s war crimes.

Trump certainly has the authority to halt weapons deliveries to Ukraine – his decision to do so was another boon for Putin. But he has gone far further. By concocting a plan that may as well have been written in the Kremlin and excluding Ukraine from negotiations, he hasn’t just put his thumb on the scale. He’s put his hand on it. That’s morally indefensible and strategically myopic.

There is some positive news. After reports that Rubio told members of Congress the 28-point plan was produced by Russia, he held talks with Andriy Yermak, Zelenskyy’s closest adviser, to rework it based on Ukraine’s reactions – although Rubio has denied this. Trump accused Ukraine of ingratitude but added that the plan was “not my final offer” and that his deadline could be extended. If the upshot of all this is that Trump’s proposal doesn’t fly, that will be a good thing – above all for Ukraine.",figurative

"Opinion: Ozzy Osbourne, no ordinary man

toggle caption Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images/Getty Images North America

By the time Ozzy Osbourne died this week at the age of 76, he'd shown that people's lives can have second acts — and more.

He had a rough childhood in Birmingham, England, left school at 15, worked odd jobs, including at a slaughterhouse, then was arrested for robbing a store, and spent six weeks in prison.

Yet Ozzy Osbourne could sing. He became a founding member of Black Sabbath, one of the bands that invented heavy metal music. But the band let him go in 1979 for often being drunk, or strung out on drugs.

Imagine how much drug and drink you'd have to do to get thrown out of a heavy metal band that had songs about drugs, like ""Snowblind"" and ""Sweet Leaf.""

Sponsor Message

Ozzy Osbourne then struck off on a solo career, and would sell more than 100 million albums.

But he persisted with drugs, drink, and a recklessness that shouldn't be just laughed off. He bit the head off a dove while signing a record deal in Los Angeles. He famously bit the head of a bat that was thrown onstage at him in Des Moines.

Ozzy canceled shows, or performed in a stupor, and sometimes attacked his bandmates. He once had a slash, as they say in British pubs, on a monument to those who died at the Alamo. He snorted a line of ants with Mötley Crüe. There are many other stories. He went into rehab programs, stopped, started, and stopped all over again.

Then, in the 2000s, Ozzy Osbourne became a hit on cable television: The Osbournes was an MTV reality series about the domestic life of his family. A performer once proclaimed as 'The Prince of Darkness' reappeared as a slightly daft and bumbling, burrito-loving suburban dad, albeit with an f-bomb charged vocabulary.

This week Alice Cooper, a founder of shock-rock, wrote on Instagram, ""I always saw Ozzy as a cross between the prince of darkness, which is the persona his fans saw, and the court jester. That was the side that his family and friends saw.""

And just last month, even as he struggled with Parkinson's, Ozzy Osbourne reunited with his Black Sabbath mates for a last show in Birmingham.

And he sang in one of their last songs:

""Yes, I've been a bad guy

Been higher than the blue sky

And the truth is I don't wanna die an ordinary man.""

He sure didn't.",figurative
"Stevie Nicks would like to get the matter of her possible near-death experience out of the way as soon as possible. A few months ago, the Fleetwood Mac singer and rock legend suffered an accident that forced her to postpone a string of tour dates, including this show in Brooklyn which was rescheduled from August to November. “I was airborne,” she recalls of the incident around five minutes after hitting the stage tonight. “I thought: ‘Is it over?’” A voice at the back of the arena lets out an animalistic yell. “No!!!!”

It’s a safe bet that everyone in the 17,000-capacity Barclays Center arena shares the sentiment. Tonight, a noticeably varied audience of fans has shown out for Nicks’s rescheduled date, ranging from witchcore-styled teens to longtime fans who retain a love for the 70s’ bohemian style as well as the decade’s social consciousness: the venue is sold out of veggie burgers.

While Nicks hasn’t released a studio album of new material since 2011’s In Your Dreams, she hasn’t strayed too far from the center of pop culture since. In recent years, she’s regularly performed with Harry Styles, helped inspire a song on Taylor Swift’s zillion-selling The Tortured Poets Department, and had two Barbie dolls created in her honour. In 2019, she became the first woman to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice, in an overdue corrective to initially sluggish critical recognition of her solo work. (She holds the record for the most Grammy nominations for female rock vocal performance without a win.)

After limbering up with some ballet moves and roaring that it’s time to get the party started, Nicks launches into a setlist spanning Fleetwood Mac classics and choice cuts from her stellar 80s albums Bella Donna and The Wild Heart. On If Anyone Falls, she’s fired up as her muscular voice rises to a shout, while the storming centerpiece Stand Back comes alive with a throbbing motorik intro, synthy power-chords, and analog bits of kit that light up like a spaceship’s control room.

The show is part musical performance, part An Evening With Stevie Nicks, with extended and sometimes self-deprecating anecdotes forming the evening’s tapestry. Before launching into a performance of the less-memorable recent single The Lighthouse, Nicks describes being invited to perform the song on Saturday Night Live. “Which I hadn’t been on since, I dunno” – she pretends to think about the year – “nineteen … hundred.” At other times, she’ll tell stories about her capes, regularly disappearing offstage to switch out one embroidered garment for another and rightly pausing to invite a little commotion for the look.

There’s a similar looseness to Nicks’s commitment to building her songs into three-dimensional theatre. In a new version of her Rumours clapback to groupies, Gold Dust Woman becomes a brilliant 13-minute cacophony during which Nicks seems to play both the song’s narrator and the flirty hanger-on: during an extended guitar solo, she dances trance-like as if crafting a love potion, before bellowing a command for the witchy intruder to get out. With her lowered register, it would be pushing it to say that Nicks had never sounded better, but she’s majestically assured on Dreams, with her deepened register adding to the song’s ache.

Missing tonight are Nicks’s former live staples like Leather and Lace, Enchanted, and Sara, as well as well-streamed minor singles like Talk To Me and Rooms On Fire. It’s hard to exactly begrudge Nicks for focusing on the material she knows works as she makes her return to the stage, but a few deeper cuts would have been welcomed by diehards as well as freshened the setlist, which is essentially a curtailed version of her 24 Karat Gold Tour.

Her sense of passion and play still burns bright. “Dance all night long,” Nicks tells the audience as parting words, after a stripped-down Landslide has brought the arena to a hush. “That’s probably what has gotten me to 77 years old. Dance on your way to the kitchen; dance on your way to watching TV; most of all, dance for me.” Her words are warm, whimsical and utterly sincere. She has more than earned her victory lap.",figurative

"When I was little, I thought hell was a fiery pit beneath the Earth’s surface. The image was vivid: flames, tortured souls and a cartoonish devil with a pitchfork.

Now that I’m an adult, I know better. Hell is actually a parent WhatsApp group.

The parent WhatsApp group – known colloquially as Satan’s Slack channel – is one of those parenting surprises no one warns you about. People tell you about the sleepless nights, the lost identity and the toys that reproduce overnight. But no one says: “You’ll one day discuss nits with 30 adults as though global peace depends on it.”

What began as a simple way to share school updates has mutated into a relentless stream of chatter. There are simply too many messages. You wake up to messages, you go to sleep to messages, you duck into a meeting and come back to 64 unread notes about sunscreen. Linda has posted the same information seven times because she doesn’t trust anyone to read it. Which, to be fair, is accurate.

When I was growing up my parents got information the old-fashioned way: crumpled notes in backpacks and gossip at pickup. They weren’t part of a digital micro-community of helicopter-adjacent strangers debating uniform policy. They didn’t refresh their phones at 9.38pm to discover that it’s going to be Harmony Day and every child needs to wear “something representing their heritage”.

My parents didn’t live in constant communication with other parents. They weren’t expected to be this connected, worrying about real-time reminders. And maybe, I’m going out on a limb here, that distance was healthy.

I don’t say this lightly … I think WhatsApp is ruining parenting.

I don’t think it’s evil, per se. In fact, it’s one of my favourite apps for keeping in touch with friends abroad. But the problem is: it’s always on. School parenting used to happen at drop-off, pickup and during homework battles at the dinner table. Now it happens first thing in the morning in bed, 11 minutes later in the bathroom and while sprinting through Kmart before school to find a T-shirt that screams “my child is Cuban-Italian”.

There’s no off switch. Go offline for an hour and suddenly everyone else knows that swimming starts this week, not next, that the assembly has been moved (again), and that Sharon’s selling year 1 tea towels for charity and you were supposed to submit your child’s portrait last Tuesday.

These groups are built for people who are permanently available and find deep meaning in the phrase “quick reminder”. They are not built for me. Or anyone with boundaries. Or a child.

Here’s the hypocrisy of it all: we limit our kids’ screen time, tell them to be present and post quotes about how “childhood is a short season” to our 600 Instagram followers. Then we feel pressured to check our WhatsApp 16 times a day, watching the theatre of parenting confusion unfold in real time.

And it is theatre. The WhatsApp group act is part coordination, part performance. Every “thanks for the reminder” is less about gratitude and more about signalling: “I’m a good parent too, I swear.” Even if I forgot the bake sale once. Or twice. Fine, three times.

I’m worried it’s making us all a bit dumber. Because if the information lives in the group, we stop paying real attention. We rely on the collective brain, on someone else (probably Linda) to notice, remind and repost. It’s the parenting equivalent of a get-out-of-jail-free card. Maybe things would be simpler if our only option was talking to people in public.

The worst part? I’ve become complicit. I can’t quit. Somewhere along the way, I volunteered to be the WhatsApp rep for my daughter’s class. I haven’t slept properly since.

I used to worry about my heart health. Now I worry I’ll die suddenly and come back as the eternal moderator of every year 2 WhatsApp group, trapped forever between reminding people about permission slips and guilt-tripping them about class fundraisers.

All I want is a note in the backpack or a quick chat at pickup. I’m craving an actual conversation with a teacher instead of ignoring her because I’ve already checked WhatsApp four times between leaving my car and getting to the gate.

I want a little space back. A crack in the digital noise. I miss the quiet confidence of not knowing everything all the time. The small mystery of what happens to my kids between drop-off and pickup. The trust that things will be fine, even if I’m not across every single message.

Maybe that’s the real lesson of modern parenting? Not to be more connected but to remember that it’s OK to step back. That missing something isn’t failing. It’s freedom.",literal
"We are a quarter of the way into the NBA season and we now have a pretty good sense of who most teams are. Now we also get to see how teams perform under a little bit of pressure with the NBA Cup, and here we talk about the teams facing it.

1. Oklahoma City Thunder

(17-1, last week No. 1)

Oklahoma City’s defense hasn’t just been good this season, it’s been suffocating — OKC’s 103 defensive rating is 7 points better than second-place Detroit. Nobody is close to them. While that’s a team effort — they play defense on a string and have a wealth of quality perimeter defenders — Chet Holmgren and his rim protection could be rewarded. He is going to get mentioned in Defensive Player of the Year conversations already, and if Victor Wembanyama can’t reach the 65-game threshold set by the league for awards (a real possibility with him being out with a calf strain), Holmgren becomes the favorite. One other note to scare the rest of the league: Oklahoma City could have two lottery picks next June. They own the Clippers’ first-round pick (the last of the Paul George trade). OKC also owns Utah’s first-rounder, but the Jazz pick is top-eight-protected, so it depends on how much Lauri Markkanen lifts his team up the rest of the way (Utah would currently draft ninth).

2. Detroit Pistons

(14-2, last week No. 3)

Detroit has had one of the best fourth quarter offenses in the NBA this season, averaging 30.3 points per game in the fourth, and has outscored opponents by 2.4 points in the fourth (third best in the league). With that, the Pistons are 11-0 this season when taking a lead into the fourth quarter. Detroit and Jalen Duran were nowhere close to a contract extension last offseason, and to his credit Duran is playing himself into a huge payday — he averages 20.5 points and 11.5 rebounds a game and looks like an All-Star, an All Defensive Team player and might be the Most Improved Player frontrunner. Duran is now critical to the Pistons’ future, and he is going to get paid like it this summer.

3. Denver Nuggets

(12-4, last week No. 2)

Denver’s improved depth is getting put to the test. Starter Christian Braun was already going to miss six weeks with a sprained ankle, and now Aaron Gordon is going to miss 4-6 weeks with a hamstring strain. Sometimes when a starter goes out injured, it’s the bench that suffers, and Denver’s bench was already bottom 10 in the league in scoring, averaging 18.6 points a game before Braun got injured. In the first two games after he went out that bench scored 15 and 9 points, but then it bounced back with two 33-point games against the Pelicans and Rockets, followed by 20 in a loss to the Kings. Peyton Watson has become a key starter now and he has averaged 14.8 points and seven rebounds per game, shooting 58.1% from the floor, when asked to start this season. He has been stepping up. Denver needs a big win vs. San Antonio Friday night to have a chance to advance to the knockout round of the NBA Cup.

4. Houston Rockets

(10-4, last week No. 4)

Kevin Durant is out for the next couple of games for personal reasons, which could put a dent in what has been the best offense in the NBA, but one doing it in a very unconventional way. The Rockets have the league’s lowest 3-point attempt rate — just 33.2% of their shots — but the league’s highest in offensive rebound rate, getting a second chance on 38.5% of their missed shots. They are top 10 in the league in points in the paint per game, 53.3. This team is mashing its way to the best offense in the league, but will that work as well without the outlet of Durant on the court? See for yourself when the Rockets take on the Suns in a fascinating second game on Peacock NBA Monday.

5. Los Angeles Lakers

(12-4, last week No. 7)

LeBron James is back, and what’s maybe most impressive about him is not that this is his 23rd NBA season (a record) or how his mind still just processes the game faster than anyone (as evidenced by his passing), it’s his willingness to accept a new, smaller role. This is Luka Doncic’s team now. Austin Reaves had become a significant presence and key shot creator. LeBron is willingly working to fit in around them. “I can fit in with anybody. I don’t understand why that was even a question,” James said in front of his locker after his debut. LeBron’s Lakers were the winners of the inaugural NBA Cup (then called the In-Season Tournament), and with a win Tuesday over the Clippers, they will clinch a spot in the quarterfinals/knockout round, a game you can watch on Coast 2 Coast Tuesday on NBC and Peacock.

LeBron James made his NBA-record 23rd season debut tonight!



👑 11 PTS

👑 12 AST

👑 @Lakers W pic.twitter.com/LkuBu0TkHH — NBA (@NBA) November 19, 2025

6. Toronto Raptors

(12-5, last week No. 9)

Toronto became the first team to punch its ticket to the quarterfinals (the knockout round) of the NBA Cup, going 3-0 in Cup play so far (they have one Group A Cup game left, against the Pacers, and while it will not impact them getting in it will matter for seeding). The NBA Cup quarterfinals are Dec. 9-10, with the higher-seeded team hosting that game (and the winner advancing to Las Vegas for Semifinals and, potentially, Finals). “I think our guys deserve the opportunity to compete in that setup,” Raptors coach Darko Rajaković said. “It’s gonna be a really different feeling for us because it’s going to be one game that will decide if we’re going to the final four or not. Definitely we have the ambition and desire to be there.”

7. Cleveland Cavaliers

(12-6, last week No. 6)

Donovan Mitchell is comfortable where the Cavaliers are so far this season because he sees the growth and potential with a team that has a top-10 defense and an improving offense. “I think for us, this is perfect,” Mitchell said after Sunday’s win over the Clippers. “There’s so many learning lessons. We have good games, we have bad games. Obviously, you want to continue to trend the right way, and I feel like we are. But I think 12-6 is right where we need to be. Continue to just progress.”

8. Phoenix Suns

(11-6, last week No. 15)

Jordan Ott has impressed in his first season as a head coach, and may even be in line for some Coach of the Year votes if Phoenix keeps playing this well. The first thing that stands out is he just has the Suns playing hard, which is a big step forward for anyone forced to watch this team the past couple of seasons. One of the things Ott has preached is Phoenix winning the possession game, and you saw that Sunday in a comeback win over San Antonio when the Suns took 20 more shots on the night. Can they do that on Peacock NBA Monday in a great early-season showdown against Houston, a game worth streaming to catch?

9. Minnesota Timberwolves

(10-6, last week No. 8)

Minnesota drafted Rob Dillingham No. 8 in 2024, envisioning someone who could step up and be the point guard of the future for them as Mike Conley aged out of the job. Well, Father Time caught up with Conley quickly (6.2 points and 3.5 assists a game this season, he looks slow), and Rob Dillingham has not been ready to step up: 4.7 points and 1.9 assists a game on 38.6% shooting (20% on 3-pointers). It’s too early to write a 20-year-old off, the Timberwolves are going to give Dillingham more time to figure it out. But this is a win-now roster, and it’s no accident that the Wolves come up in talks about potential trades for point guards such as LaMelo Ball, Ja Morant and Trae Young (whether any of those is a fit in Minnesota is another question). Point guard is now a long term concern for Minnesota.

10. Miami Heat

(11-6, last week No. 17)

Winners of four in a row, and now Tyler Herro is set to make his return to the court Monday night against Dallas. It will be interesting to see him fit into the Heat’s new isolation style attacking offense, or whether they run a few more pick-and-rolls for the best P&R ball handler on the roster. If Miami can defeat Milwaukee on Wednesday, it will move to the top of East Group C and have a chance to advance to the quarterfinals of the NBA Cup (the Heat would be 3-1, but the Knicks control their own destiny and would take the group if they win out).

11. San Antonio Spurs

(11-6, last week No. 11)

The Spurs have gone 3-1 without Victor Wembanyama, who is out with a calf strain (and the buzz around the league is he could miss closer to a month, in part because San Antonio will be cautious with his return). The Spurs also have been without Stephon Castle the past three games, forcing Julian Champagnie and Luke Kornet into the starting five. That starting unit has not impressed, but the bench has, which is why the Spurs won their first three games without Wemby (and had a double-digit lead over the Suns but couldn’t hold it).

12. Boston Celtics

(9-8, last week No. 18)

The biggest question coming into the season in Boston was at center, because Kristaps Porzingis, Luke Kornet and Al Horford were all gone. Neemias Queta has answered that question — he has been impressive as the starting five, averaging 9.3 points on 62.8% shooting, and grabbing 7.9 rebounds a game. However, his more significant impact is on the defensive end, where the Celtics are 19.8 points per 100 possessions better when he is on the court.

13. Orlando Magic

(10-8, last week No. 16)

The Magic have gone 3-2 without Paolo Banchero (left groin strain), but with a good +6.4 net rating. The idea that the Magic are better without Banchero is foolish, but it’s fair to question whether there is a ceiling on this offense with him and another natural forward, Franz Wagner, as the primary shot creators. It just doesn’t flow. That said, Orlando has gone 8-4 in its last 12 games (with a +7.1 net rating) after a 1-4 start to the season, thanks in large part to Desmond Bane looking more comfortable and an improved defense.

14. New York Knicks

(9-6, last week No. 5)

This ranking feels a little low for the Knicks, but they have stumbled of late. New York is 1-2 on its current five-game road trip and is now 1-5 for the season away from Madison Square Garden — and that lone win, against Dallas last week, only happened because Brandon Williams got called for hooking Landry Shamet on a drive for a game-tying layup. The Knicks control their own destiny in the NBA Cup, beat Charlotte on the road on Wednesday then Milwaukee at home on Friday and the Knicks advance to the quarterfinals.

15. Atlanta Hawks

(11-7, last week No. 13)

Since Trae Young went out with a sprained knee, the Hawks are 9-4 with a +6.3 net rating, with a slightly above average offense and a top-10 in the league defense. Not only did the wheels not fall off without Young on the court, but this stretch may also have shown a path to a future without him. Atlanta went into this season with a roster specifically built to maximize Young’s strengths, and the front office wanted to see what that roster could do before making any long-term decisions about a new contract for Young (they did not extend him last summer, and he can opt out and become a free agent next summer) or Kristaps Porzingis. What they have learned so far is that this team is not bad without Young. That could play into future decisions.

16. Philadelphia 76ers

(9-7, last week No. 14)

Paul George has been on a minute restriction since his return, averaging 13.3 points in 22 minutes a night, and Philly has a -2.2 net rating with him on the court in that small sample size. Whether George and Joel Embiid are playing or not, this is Tyrese Maxey’s team, he drives the offense and leads the league in touches, averaging five more a night than Nikola Jokic. Behind him, the 76ers have been one of the best fourth quarter teams in the league this season, averaging 30.1 points per game in the fourth (fourth best in the league), they are outscoring opponents by 5.1 in the fourth (best in the league), and with that have a solid 6-5 record in games where they trailed entering the fourth.

17. Chicago Bulls

(9-7, last week No. 19)

On paper, the Bulls had a good week, winning three of four, including beating the Nuggets, and Nikola Vucevic drained a game-winner against the Trail Blazers. However, after the Bulls beat the lowly Wizards 121-120 Sunday, Vucevic was not happy and tried to explain to a young roster why: “For three quarters, we were very soft. We gave no resistance. We didn’t do anything that we talked about. Just played really soft. It was really bad.” Chicago is on the road this week, but with winnable games against New Orleans, Charlotte and Indiana.

18. Golden State Warriors

(9-9, last week No. 10)

Golden State is 4-6 in its last 10 games and, according to Jimmy Butler, the issue is the team’s defense in that stretch. Over those 10 games, the Warriors have a defensive rating of 112.4, 12th in the league. Jimmy Butler summed it up this way: “We’re just not guarding nobody. From what I can tell, I haven’t been here long, but that’s never been the formula here. To win a championship, you got to take each and every matchup personal. Yeah, help’s going to be there, but we got to do way better guarding on that side of the ball.”

19. Milwaukee Bucks

(8-9, last week No. 12)

The Bucks have dropped both games since Giannis Antetokounmpo went out with a groin strain and now have dropped four in a row and 5-of-6, with a -9 net rating in those six games. Milwaukee controls its own destiny in the NBA Cup but will have to beat Miami and New York on the road — without Antetokounmpo — to advance. That’s a big ask.

20. Portland Trail Blazers

(7-10, last week No. 20)

The Trail Blazers surprisingly control their own destiny and can win the NBA Cup West Group C — the “group of death” with five of the top nine teams in the conference — by beating San Antonio on Wednesday night. That will mean turning things around fast, the Trail Blazers are 2-7 in their last nine with a -7.9 net rating in those games.

21. Los Angeles Clippers

(5-12, last week No. 23)

Kawhi Leonard made his return to the court after missing 10 games with an ankle/foot sprain, and scored 20 in a loss to the Cavaliers, shooting 6-of-13 in his 26 minutes. Just his return should help other Clippers because of his gravity. For example, the most underrated player in the league is not so underrated anymore — Ivica Zubac is drawing a lot more defensive attention this season, something coach Tyronn Lue talked about recently: “Just double team the post, not let him get a rhythm on the post. Also just fronting the post a lot, so now we got a flash and trying to hit him over the top. But [teams] doing a good job just trying to keep it out of his hands, and when they can try to push him off the block so he’s not in his sweet spot.” Part of the reason teams are collapsing on Zubac is that without Norman Powell or near enough shot creation and shooting, teams are not penalized for packing the paint and focusing on stopping him. Despite the rough start, the Clippers can go to 3-0 in NBA Cup play and put themselves in the driver’s seat to advance to the knockout round with a win “on the road” against the Lakers this week, a game you can watch on Coast 2 Coast Tuesday on NBC and Peacock.

22. Memphis Grizzlies

(6-11, last week No. 25)

The Grizzlies took advantage of the schedule and snapped a streak where they had lost 9-of-10 and knocked off the Kings and Mavericks in their last two games — doing so without the services of injured-but-still-talking-trash Ja Morant and the just injured Jaren Jackson Jr. It may be tough to keep that streak going against Denver on Monday (and don’t trash talk Jokic, you don’t want him playing angry), the Memphis heads out on the road again for its next four.

23. Utah Jazz

(5-11, last week No. 22)

Lauri Markkanen is averaging 29.3 points per game, but is doing it while barely dribbling the ball — 91% of his shot attempts have come off two dribbles or fewer (compare that to SGA, where more than 45% of his shots come off 7+ dribbles). It’s because the Jazz work hard to free him with off-ball actions, which makes him very difficult to cover. Lakers coach J.J. Redick talked about it before one of their matchups last week. “He’s getting about 31 off-ball screens a game ... I’m not comparing him to Steph Curry, but there’s a similarity to the scout in terms of his your awareness on him. If he’s head under and he’s not trying to duck you in or post you up, he’s going to come off something. He’s going to come off a smash or he’s going to come off a pin down. He’s at the top of the floor, he’s going to get a chest. If he’s in the corner, he’s going to get a single or a double, like you just have to have heightened awareness on him at all times.”

24. Dallas Mavericks

(5-13, last week No. 24)

Dallas has gone 3-10 with Anthony Davis in street clothes, although he could be nearing a return (depending on what the Dallas medical staff is thinking). If Mavericks fans want something to be thankful for through all of this it’s not just Cooper Flagg, but how much better and more comfortable Flagg has looked when played on the wing, his natural spot (the point forward experiment is over).

25. Charlotte Hornets

(4-13, last week No. 21)

The good news is that Brandon Miller is back after missing 13 games with a shoulder injury (and he scored 21 in his return against the Clippers). The other good news in Charlotte to start the season is just how well rookie Kon Knueppel has played. His 18.8 points per game is top among rookies, he’s shooting 42.1% from 3-point range and grabbing 5.8 rebounds a game. It’s early, but Knueppel is right in the middle of the Rookie of the Year discussion with Cooper Flagg and V.J. Edgecombe.

26. Brooklyn Nets

(3-13, last week No. 27)

Brooklyn has the second-worst defense in the league, but one guy who might start to turn things around on that end — and be a key piece for this team long term — is rookie Drake Powell, coach Jordi Fernandez said this week. “He’s very capable of being one of the best perimeter defenders in the league. He’s just a rookie right now, and he doesn’t even know it, but I see the tools. He just has to keep embracing that part and believing that he can do it. And what he’s doing right now is good, but it could be even better. If he has that belief, conviction and work ethic, the sky’s the limit for him defensively.” Egor Demin could be part of the future, too, but he’s got to start getting downhill more: He’s taken 14 shots in the restricted area this season (13.3% of this attempts) and 73 3-point attempts (69.6% of his total shot attempts).

27. Sacramento Kings

(4-13, last week No. 26)

DeMar DeRozan summed up where the Kings are emotionally after losing eight straight, saying they are “In a s**** place. Don’t nobody want to lose the way we’ve been losing… I think it’s just everything right now for us is just s****, honestly. Sometimes when you’re in the deep end, it’s hard to hear anything. You’re just trying to swim your way out, one way or another.” Adding to Sacramento’s pile of, um, manure is the news that Domantas Sabonis will be out at least a month with a torn meniscus. If you’re a Sacramento fan searching for a reason to believe the team can turn things around, there is this: the Kings have played the toughest schedule in the league so far this season. Things will get easier.

28. New Orleans Pelicans

(2-15, last week No. 28)

Zion Williamson returned to the court this week and averaged 18 points and 4.5 rebounds in the two games played. The story in New Orleans has been Derik Queen. He faced some unfair expectations because of the overpay Joe Dumars gave up to get him (control of the Pelcians’ 2026 first-round pick, which looks like it will be a high one in a deep draft), but Queen himself has been impressive. He put up 30 points, nine rebounds, four assists and a couple of blocks going up against three-time MVP Nikola Jokic, for the first time, and after the game earned praise from Jokic: “He’s an amazing player. You can see some similarities [to me]. I don’t want people to see him and tell him he’s something like me. He’s a good enough player to have his own story.”

When a talented rookie takes on a bonafide superstar it’s must-see TV. 🍿



🎥 Altitude Sports pic.twitter.com/Z7ApF2UZSw — NBA on NBC and Peacock (@NBAonNBC) November 20, 2025

29. Indiana Pacers

(2-14, last week No. 29)

Pacers fans looking for a bright spot can point to the return of Bennedict Mathurin to the lineup. He has played in just five games this season, but is averaging 26.4 points a night. The Pacers picked up a win last week against lowly Charlotte and have a good shot at another one Friday against the one team below them in these rankings.

30. Washington Wizards

(1-15, last week No. 30)

Washington hasn’t won a game since a week before Halloween. The biggest problem is that the young team — even with a couple of veterans like CJ McCollum and Khris Middleton — can’t close games. Washington averages 24.9 points a game in the fourth quarter, and they get outscored by 7.5 points a game in the fourth, both of which are the worst in the league. Washington is 0-11 when trailing heading into the fourth and 1-4 when they are ahead entering the final frame.

"The Giants are making another change to their coaching staff.

According to multiple reports, the team has fired defensive coordinator Shane Bowen. The move comes a couple of weeks after they terminated head coach Brian Daboll and made their offensive coordinator Mike Kafka the interim head coach.

Daboll resisted calls to let Bowen go after the team blew big leads in the fourth quarter of losses to the Cowboys and Broncos. They did it again against the Bears in Daboll’s final game in Week 10 and blew their fifth double-digit lead of the season in Sunday’s overtime loss to the Lions.

Bowen oversaw a defense that has the Giants ranked 30th in points allowed this season. That’s worse than they managed last season despite investing a first-round pick in edge rusher Abdul Carter and signing a number of free agents they thought would improve the unit.

The Giants will try to do that again this offseason and someone other than Bowen will be calling the shots once they do.",literal
"Europe’s leaders cannot stop talking about democracy. President Emmanuel Macron says he wants to kickstart a democratic “resurgence”, and Friedrich Merz, the German chancellor, has warned of an “axis” of autocratic states targeting liberal democracy in Europe. Having promised to “fight” for what she calls European “values”, Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, has just announced a new “democracy shield” and a Centre for Democratic Resilience to prevent foreign interference and deal with external threats. I keep hoping for similar scrutiny of democratic backsliding within the EU – but so far it has not happened.

Foreign interference, disinformation and the creeping illiberalism of Hungary, Poland and Slovakia deserve attention. But lost in this fretting is a more inconvenient truth: within Europe’s “mature” democracies, there is a steady corrosion of the rule of law, a degradation of political discourse and the normalisation of racism, xenophobia and discrimination.

Growing up in a country where democracy was fragile and frequently interrupted, I learned early that the issue is not merely about elections. It is about the quality of governance and of politicians. It depends on protecting human rights and dignity, ensuring social justice, respecting minorities – and minority views – and creating a genuine sense of belonging for all citizens.

That is why I am troubled when EU governments and political elites undermine the rule of law, constrain free speech, normalise police violence and ignore signs that racism and xenophobia have seeped into public life. Across the bloc, the demonisation of racialised refugees and migrants has become common. Ironically, even as they champion democratic renewal, Merz, Macron and von der Leyen are chipping away at the very values they claim to defend.

When Merz urged journalists to “ask your daughters” about why Germany’s changing “cityscape” threatens their security, he did more than infantilise German women. He activated toxic colonial and orientalist tropes of Black and brown men as violent, hypersexual, uncivilised aggressors, as bodies to be policed, controlled and deported. Though he later acknowledged migrants’ economic contributions, the damage was done. Merz moved Germany’s Overton window on what is considered acceptable in political discourse, thereby giving more oxygen to the far right.

In France, too, Macron’s legacy will be marked not only by his attempts at liberal reforms but by his legitimisation of far-right narratives. By echoing Marine Le Pen’s rhetoric on national identity, Islam and migration, Macron has normalised what was once unsayable for centrists. The far-right National Rally now stands as a respectable government-in-waiting precisely because the so-called liberal centre helped embed its ideas in the mainstream.

A similar dynamic is playing out within EU institutions. Italy’s Giorgia Meloni may have set the shameful example by outsourcing the processing of asylum seekers to Albania, but it is the European Commission that has incorporated deportation as a legitimate policy tool in the EU’s new migration pact – and von der Leyen who keeps signing migration-deterrence deals with regimes such as those in Tunisia and Egypt that are accused of abuse and torture.

Israel’s genocide in Gaza has laid bare the many ways in which the EU is in violation of its own norms and principles, as well as in flagrant breach of its obligations under international law to prevent and punish genocide. In Germany, police forces have been condemned by UN experts for criminalising and suppressing legitimate Palestinian solidarity activism. In Belgium, the use of teargas, batons and water cannon against peaceful protesters outside the European parliament prompted calls for an investigation from Amnesty International. EU institutions are quick to condemn state violence in other parts of the world, but are silent when it occurs within their own borders.

After every European election, we reassure ourselves that the “centre is holding”. The reality is that whether in national governments or in the European parliament, far-right parties are increasingly shaping the European agenda. The conservative European People’s party has grown ever-more comfortable forming majorities with far-right groups, especially on environmental policy. Politicians across Europe are adopting far-right talking points on migration and Muslims. The excuse is always that this is being done to contain the hardliners, even though studies consistently show that such mimicry amplifies and normalises extremism.

Still, there are glimmers of hope. Spain’s Pedro Sánchez has shown moral clarity on Gaza and adopted a national migration policy which is rooted in dignity and solidarity. In the Netherlands, Rob Jetten of the centre-left D66, expected to lead a new coalition, ran on a platform of hope rather than hate and spoke out against Israel’s genocide. The UK Green party’s Zack Polanski and Ireland’s new president Catherine Connolly are helping to revive a progressive political discourse in their countries. And across the Atlantic, New York’s new mayor, Zohran Mamdani, a proud son of immigrants and unapologetic advocate for justice, housing and solidarity, has demonstrated that democracy’s vitality depends on moral courage and inclusive coalitions – and that racial and religious identity can be a source of pride.

European leaders should take note that, even as the EU arms itself with a “democracy shield”, strengthening democratic resilience is not only about fighting external threats, adversaries and disinformation. It is also about building inclusive democracy at home, dismantling racism, ensuring equality and creating a sense of belonging for all European citizens.",figurative
"Trump signs order to integrate supercomputers and data assets in order to create ‘AI experimentation platform”.

Click here to share on social media

United States President Donald Trump has unveiled a national initiative to mobilise artificial intelligence (AI) for accelerating scientific breakthroughs.

Trump signed an executive order on Monday to establish “The Genesis Mission”, the latest iteration of his administration’s aggressive strategy for spurring AI development through deregulation, infrastructure investment and public-private collaboration.

Trump’s order directs US Energy Secretary Chris Wright to unite scientists and technologies at the country’s 17 national laboratories into “one cooperative system for research”.

Under the initiative, US supercomputers and data resources will be integrated to create a “closed-loop AI experimentation platform”, according to the order.

The White House, which likened the initiative to the Apollo programme that put the first man on the moon, said priority areas of focus would include the “greatest scientific challenges of our time,” such as nuclear fusion, semiconductors, critical materials and space exploration.

Michael Kratsios, the White House’s top science adviser, said the initiative took a “revolutionary approach” to scientific research.

“The Genesis Mission connects world-class scientific data with the most advanced American AI to unlock breakthroughs in medicine, energy, materials science, and beyond,” Kratsios said.

Chipmaker Nvidia and AI startup Anthropic said on Monday that they were partnering with the Trump administration on the initiative.

“Uniting the National Labs, USG, industry, and academia, this effort will connect America’s leading supercomputers, AI systems, and next-generation quantum machines into the most complex scientific instrument ever built – accelerating breakthroughs in energy, discovery, and national security,” Nvidia said in a social media post, referring to the US government (USG).

Since re-entering the White House, Trump has made cutting red tape to fast-track the development of AI a key plank of his economic agenda.

Last week, Trump called on the US Congress to pass legislation to create a national standard for AI, while criticising state governments over their laws regulating the emerging technology.

“Overregulation by the States is threatening to undermine this Growth Engine,” Trump said on his platform, Truth Social.

“We MUST have one Federal Standard instead of a patchwork of 50 State Regulatory Regimes.”",literal
"Hezbollah says Tabatabai was a member since group’s foundation and held several senior military roles.

Israel has attacked the Haret Hreik area in the southern suburbs of Lebanon’s capital, Beirut, killing five people, including Hezbollah’s highest ranking military official.

Sunday’s attack, which took place amid an uptick in Israeli attacks across Lebanon, was the first on Beirut’s southern suburbs in several months and the first without warning since last year’s ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah was announced.

Haytham Ali Tabatabai, Hezbollah’s chief of staff, also known as Sayyid Abu Ali, was among those targeted and killed. This was the third attempt on his life, according to Israeli media, which reported that the two prior attempts occurred during last year’s war with Israel, which culminated in a United States-brokered ceasefire in November 2024.

Israel has since been accused of violating that ceasefire on a near-daily basis by United Nations experts. Hezbollah has responded to Israel’s continued attacks once, in December.

Who was Haytham Ali Tabatabai?

Before the attack, Tabatabai’s name was not widely known in Lebanon. Hezbollah’s military operatives tend to work in the shadows to avoid Israeli assassinations.

But since his death on Sunday, it has been revealed that Tabatabai held many senior positions within the armed political group during his tenure.

He was born in 1968 in Bashoura, a neighbourhood in Beirut, to Lebanese parents although his father reportedly had Iranian roots. He grew up in southern Lebanon and reportedly joined Hezbollah in the 1980s.

In its official announcement, Hezbollah said Tabatabai had been part of the group since its founding in 1982 as a resistance movement against the Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon. In the post-war period, Hezbollah grew to become Lebanon’s strongest political party and military force, serving in Lebanon’s parliament and having ministers in several governments.

Tabatabai was a senior military official in Hezbollah with extensive military experience. He reportedly took part in a number of field operations in Israeli-occupied southern Lebanon and led Hezbollah’s Nabatieh axis, or command area, from 1996 until Israel withdrew from southern Lebanon in 2000.

According to Hezbollah, Tabatabai then led the Khiam axis from 2000 until 2008 and was in command during the July 2006 war, which saw Israel and Hezbollah fight to a draw after 34 days. The group also said Tabatabai participated in establishing Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force.

Later, he was responsible for Hezbollah’s operations along the border with Syria and took over responsibilities for the operations branch during last year’s war with Israel.

According to Israeli media reports, Tabatabai led Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force in Syria and Yemen before replacing Ali Karaki, who was assassinated during last year’s war, as commander of Hezbollah’s southern front.

He was appointed as Hezbollah’s chief of staff after the war, in which most of Hezbollah’s senior military leaders were killed by Israel.

“Tabatabai was the one reorganising Hezbollah’s military leadership, and the targeting of the southern suburbs of Beirut is an indication that the Lebanese state has no guarantees against the expansion of such attacks,” Sohaib Jawhar, a nonresident fellow at the Beirut-based Badil, the Alternative Policy Institute, told Al Jazeera.

What has Hezbollah said about his death?

In its statement, Hezbollah confirmed the loss of “the great martyr jihadist commander” known as Sayyid Abu Ali and described Israel’s assassination as a “treacherous attack on the Haret Hreik area in the suburbs of Beirut”.

Mahmoud Qmati, vice president of the group’s Political Council, lamented “yet another ceasefire violation” and accused Israel of escalating the conflict “with the green light given by the United States”.

Hezbollah released a compilation video showing footage of Tabatabai operating in the field.

It also confirmed the deaths of four other Hezbollah members: Qassem Hussein Berjawi, Rifaat Ahmad Hussein, Mostafa Asaad Berro and Ibrahim Ali Hussein.

Hezbollah MP Ali Ammar accused Israel of again violating the ceasefire.

“Every attack on Lebanon is a crossing of a red line, and this aggression is inherent in the entity that targets Lebanon’s dignity, sovereignty and the security of its citizens,” he said.

What has the Lebanese state said?

Just two days before the attack, Lebanese President Joseph Aoun announced the government’s intention to enter peace negotiations with Israel with support from the international community.

Advertisement

After the attack on Sunday, however, Aoun called on the international community to intervene to stop Israeli attacks on his country.

Frustration has been building in parts of Lebanon as some locals feel the government is not properly equipped or willing to respond to Israel’s repeated aggressions. Many residents in southern Lebanon have expressed feelings of abandonment by the Lebanese government because it has been unable to prevent repeated Israeli attacks or rebuild destroyed homes.

What has Israel said?

After Sunday’s strike, Israel said it “remains committed to the understandings agreed upon between the State of Israel and Lebanon”, likely referring to the existing ceasefire.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the strike had been ordered after recommendations from the defence minister and the Israeli army’s chief of staff, and he justified it by accusing Tabatabai of posing a threat to Israeli security.

The Israeli army released a statement, saying: “Tabatabai commanded most of Hezbollah’s units and worked extensively to restore their readiness for war with Israel. The [Israeli military] will act against attempts to rebuild and rearm Hezbollah and will operate forcefully to remove any threat against Israel.”

Was the US aware of the attack beforehand?

According to the US news website Axios, US officials were aware that an “escalation” was expected but were not informed of the details of this particular strike. An official told Axios the US had been informed by Israel’s government directly after the strike.

What happens now?

Qmati said Israel’s strike had crossed a “red line” and the group’s leadership would now consider whether a response was warranted.

“The strike on the southern suburbs today opens the door to an escalation of assaults all over Lebanon,” he said.",literal

"Opinion: Robert Redford will always light up our screens

toggle caption Andrew Medichini/AP

Robert Redford died this week at the age of 89. But his performances are indelible.

We'll still see him as the Sundance Kid alongside Paul Newman's Butch Cassidy, leaping off a cliff into rocky rapids. Roy Hobbs in ""The Natural,"" shattering the stadium lights with a home run. Bob Woodward in ""All the President's Men,"" teamed with Dustin Hoffman's Carl Bernstein: reporters in scuffed shoes and dangling neckties, digging out the squalid details of a presidential scandal.

And then there are the fine films he directed, including ""Ordinary People,"" ""Quiz Show,"" and ""A River Runs Through It.""

Sponsor Message

But Robert Redford's artistic vision will be projected beyond his lifetime, in the works of filmmakers whose careers took off from the Sundance Institute and Film Festival — named after that infamous Kid — dedicated to supporting independent and risk-taking work.

""Blood Simple,"" the first film from the Coen Brothers, Steven Soderbergh's ""Sex, Lies, and Videotape,"" and Quentin Tarantino's ""Reservoir Dogs"" all premiered at Sundance. So did Kevin Smith's ""Clerks,"" Ava DuVernay's ""Middle of Nowhere,"" Ryan Coogler's ""Fruitvale Station,"" and Sian Heder's ""CODA,"" which went on to win three Oscars, including Best Picture.

""He opened a door on 'the possible' for so many young talented artists,"" John Cooper, who once headed the Sundance Film Festival, told us this week. ""And they went on to show others the possibilities in themselves.""

Robert Redford was, well, Robert Redford: handsome, famous and charismatic. But he didn't always embrace the golden smile life had bestowed on him, telling The New York Times in 1974, ""This glamour image can be a real handicap. Image is crap.""

As the critic Peter Debruge suggested in Variety this week, ""Sundance was his way…to put it in eco-conscious terms — of recycling the good fortune he'd enjoyed into opportunities for others.""

And he wasn't a distant benefactor. John Cooper described how much Redford enjoyed working over ideas with young filmmakers at the Sundance Institute each summer.

""Working on scenes, working on scripts,"" he said. ""I think that recharged his creative batteries.""

For decades, Robert Redford helped talented artists follow his Sundance leap into the rocky rapids of filmmaking. In a way, his work will still light up our screens.",literal
"Idrissa Gana Gueye has been shown a red card for an incredible incident in which he slapped Michael Keane in the face during Monday’s Premier League game between Everton and Manchester United at Old Trafford.

Referee Tony Harrington didn’t have a choice.

The game was not even a quarter-hour old and Everton had already been forced into a substitution when Seamus Coleman suffered an injury requiring the introduction of Jake O’Brien.

Man United had the better of play and some poor communication between the Toffees allowed a Bryan Mbeumo penalty shout and then a dangerous shot from Bruno Fernandes.

MORE — Man United vs Everton recap, video highlights

Something in that sequence enraged Gana Gueye, who approached a perturbed Michael Keane with vigor. Keane shoved Gana Gueye back up field, and that found a new boiling point as Gana Gueye used his left hand to slap Keane in the jaw.

Gana Gueye was held back from reaching either Keane or the referee by Iliman Ndiaye and Jordan Pickford. It isn’t quite Newcastle United’s Lee Bowyer and Kieron Dyer exchanging blows and being separated by Aston Villa players, but it’s familiar enough.

Now the midfield will miss three games.

"'What you see is really me,' says 'Wicked' star Cynthia Erivo

toggle caption Lisa O'Connor/AFP via Getty Images

There's a moment in the new movie, Wicked: For Good, when Elphaba, the so-called Wicked Witch, stops defending herself to a world that has misunderstood her and embraces her own power. Cynthia Erivo, who plays Elphaba, sees a connection between her character's trajectory and her own.

""There were so many sort of real parallels — the relationship with her father, the relationship to being in spaces that don't really include you,"" Erivo says. ""The feelings you see in the movie are very real feelings.""

Erivo grew up in London as the child of Nigerian immigrants. From an early age, it was evident that she had a powerful singing voice. She attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, but felt like an outsider.

Sponsor Message

""It was a tough experience to be there. I just didn't think I fit,"" she says. ""And I think there was sort of a lack of wanting to understand where I was coming from or who I was as a person.""

Erivo first broke through on Broadway in The Color Purple, winning a Tony Award for her portrayal of Celie. She went on to earn an Oscar nomination for her portrayal of Harriet Tubman, and later played Aretha Franklin in Genius Aretha.

In Wicked: For Good, Erivo reprises her role as Elphaba, alongside Ariana Grande as Glinda, in this final chapter of the Wicked story. Both Wicked movies were filmed at the same time, which proved challenging at times.

""There were days where, luckily, you would sort of know where the character was at this point [in the story],"" Erivo says. ""But there were some times where you're sort of guessing really, because you hadn't shot a certain scene, you're just sort of assuming that the scene is gonna feel this way.""

Erivo also has a new memoir, Simply More: A Book for Anyone who Has Been Told They're Too Much, which details her childhood in South London and her path to the stage.

Interview highlights

On her physical training for Wicked

I'd [swim] laps, then sing and then I'd run. ... It's the idea that if I'm doing something that's strenuous and I can sing it whilst I'm doing the thing that's strenuous, when I'm standing still, it'll just be there. I won't actually have to work that hard for it to be there. ... Once your body has it in it, it just sort of lives with you. And so that's what I wanted for myself.

On getting into character through perfume

I started doing this years and years ago. The first time I did it, I think I did with Harriet [Tubman] and hers was, like, cedarwood and lavender, I think it was, but like essence with a base oil, not a perfume, because I wanted it to feel like something she could find, that she could discover, make, as opposed to something you could just buy in a store and spray on oneself. Because of the time, because of who she was, I wanted it to feel like it was of the Earth. And then I realized how powerful it was for me. And so I kept doing it with my characters. ...

So Elphaba, who's younger, I sort of messed around with big florals, like really deep florals. So tuberose, rose, lilies and then I mixed it with a tobacco oud. It was a scent called Witchy Woo. When I found it, I thought, there's no way this is going to work. It will be way too on the nose. … I was staying at a Soho Farmhouse in the UK and they have this little sort of gift shop and in the back they have a few perfumes … I sprayed some on my hand and immediately I wasn't convinced, but you know how perfume changes? … My body is like, no, this is a really good scent. There was a reason it was there for you, go back for it.

On her decision to cut, and then shave, her hair

I want them to just see my face. I want, when I walk in, for them to see a canvas that can transform.

It started a long time ago, just as I was coming out of drama school. I just knew that I wanted something different. Around that time, everyone who was auditioning, girls who were auditioning wanted long hair and a particular kind of aesthetic, and I sort of repelled against the idea because I didn't want any distractions. I don't know what gave me the idea, what gave [me] the wherewithal to think, I want to lessen the distraction. I want them to just see my face. I want, when I walk in, for them to see a canvas that can transform. A vessel. That what you see is really me, and I can change into the character in front of your very eyes.

After I left drama school, I cut my hair. I went to get a haircut and the hairdresser was very, very scared to cut it, because my hair was quite long. It came down past my shoulders. … If you're African, often you cut your hair if you lose someone. So there's an understanding of loss. You know that the old adage when a woman cuts her hair or changes her hairstyle, a life shift has happened. That is very true of the Nigerian tradition. And so, for me, I felt like I went for my own life shift. ... It was sort of leaving [drama school] behind and taking from it what I needed and letting go of whatever else I didn't. And when I cut my hair, I felt strangely like myself. I've felt like I've been steadily moving towards cutting it off completely, and Wicked was the moment when I took it off completely.

It's one of those moments that I've started to learn to forgive myself for because ... previously I've felt so mad at myself. So I guess there's a part of me that's a little bit ashamed that I would sort of give up my voice in that way. But it's also why I'm vehemently protective of the way I use my voice. I do not say yes to everything at all. It has to mean something for me to sing, and it has to make sense. I will never give my voice to someone like that again, because it felt like someone removing a gift that was meant for me and giving it to someone else. It just felt, in the moment, really awful, and I remember feeling really wrong. It felt wrong.

On not growing up with her father, and not having a relationship with him as an adult

Macmillan

I think I'm in a real place of acceptance, and a strange apathy as well. I don't wish him harm, but it's not like I'm waiting for some grand resolution. I'm sort of OK with it being exactly what it is. I have no desire to start a relationship. I have no desire to mend a relationship. But it doesn't really occupy my thoughts.

If the point of doing the things you love or the point of doing a thing that you're good at is to make someone care about you, is to prove that you are meant to be loved, is to prove that you are worthy of being loved, it doesn't sustain. Because really and truly, the most important love is that of yourself. It has to come from you first.

"SEVENTEEN: Tiny Desk Concert

This is the very first K-pop band to play behind the Tiny Desk. SEVENTEEN's name comes from an equation: 13 members + 3 teams + 1 group. Those three teams focus on hip-hop, vocal and performance to come together as one. SEVENTEEN (SVT for short) recently celebrated its 10th anniversary with a world tour, performing in big stadiums for millions of fans (aka Carats). After their last U.S. concert in Washington, D.C., five of the members stopped by the NPR Music office to play in front of what's likely their smallest audience ever.

Bred from an industry that's all about a polished look and sound, these members put a lot of trust into our Tiny Desk team to be vulnerable in our space. Just like most artists that play our series, they were nervous, but you can see how much fun Dino, Seungkwan, Joshua, Vernon and Mingyu (from left to right) have as they casually talk between songs. It also doesn't hurt that the crowd — filled with screaming fans — made them feel at ease. SEVENTEEN's set features a medley of old and new songs, which is the perfect sampling of its extensive catalog, ending strong with ""VERY NICE.""

"The US president is pushing a UN resolution that would revive the mandate structure of 100 years ago almost entirely, simply replacing the UK with the US as the authority in control.

The Trump administration is pushing an Israeli-crafted resolution at the UN Security Council (UNSC) this week aimed at eliminating the possibility of a State of Palestine. The resolution does three things. It establishes US political control over the Gaza Strip. It separates Gaza from the rest of Palestine. And it allows the US, and therefore Israel, to determine the timeline for Israel’s supposed withdrawal from Gaza, which would mean never.

This is imperialism masquerading as a peace process. In and of itself, it is no surprise. Israel runs US foreign policy in the Middle East. What is a surprise is that the US and Israel might just get away with this travesty unless the world speaks up with urgency and indignation.

The draft UNSC resolution would establish a US-UK-dominated Board of Peace, chaired by none other than President Donald Trump himself, and endowed with sweeping powers over Gaza’s governance, borders, reconstruction, and security. This resolution would sideline the State of Palestine and condition any transfer of authority to the Palestinians on the indulgence of the Board of Peace.

This would be an overt return to the British mandate of 100 years ago, with the only change being that the US would hold the mandate rather than the United Kingdom. If it were not so utterly tragic, it would be laughable. As Marx said, history repeats itself, first as tragedy, then as farce. Yes, the proposal is a farce, yet Israel’s genocide is not. It is a tragedy of the first order.

Incredibly, according to the draft resolution, the Board of Peace would be granted sovereign powers in Gaza. Palestinian sovereignty is left to the discretion of the board, which alone would decide when Palestinians are “ready” to govern themselves – perhaps in another 100 years? Even military security is subordinated to the board, and the envisioned forces would answer not to the UNSC or to the Palestinian people, but to the board’s “strategic guidance”.

Advertisement

The US-Israel resolution is being put forward precisely because the rest of the world – other than Israel and the US – has woken up to two facts. First, Israel is committing genocide, a reality witnessed every day in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, where innocent Palestinians are murdered to the satisfaction of the Israeli military and illegal Israeli settlers in the West Bank. Second, Palestine is a state, albeit one whose sovereignty remains obstructed by the US, which uses its veto in the UNSC to block Palestine’s permanent UN membership. At the UN this past July and then again in September, the UN General Assembly voted overwhelmingly for Palestine’s statehood, a fact that put the Israel-US Zionist lobby into overdrive, resulting in the current draft resolution.

For Israel to accomplish its goal of Greater Israel, the US is pursuing a classic divide-and-conquer strategy, squeezing Arab and Islamic states with threats and inducements. When other countries resist the US-Israel demands, they are cut off from critical technologies, lose access to World Bank and IMF financing, and suffer Israeli bombing, even in countries with US military bases present. The US offers no real protection; rather, it orchestrates a protection racket, extracting concessions from countries wherever US leverage exists. This extortion will continue until the global community stands up to such tactics and insists upon genuine Palestinian sovereignty and US and Israeli adherence to international law.

Palestine remains the endless victim of US and Israeli manoeuvres. The results are not just devastating for Palestine, which has suffered an outright genocide, but for the Arab world and beyond. Israel and the US are currently at war, overtly or covertly, across the Horn of Africa (Libya, Sudan, Somalia), the eastern Mediterranean (Lebanon, Syria), the Gulf region (Yemen), and Western Asia (Iraq, Iran).

If the UNSC is to provide true security according to the UN Charter, it must not yield to US pressures and instead act decisively in line with international law. A resolution truly for peace should include four vital points. First, it should welcome the State of Palestine as a sovereign UN member state, with the US lifting its veto. Second, it should safeguard the territorial integrity of the State of Palestine and Israel, according to the 1967 borders. Third, it should establish a UNSC-mandated protection force drawn up from Muslim-majority states. Fourth, it should include the defunding and disarmament of all belligerent non-state entities, and it should ensure the mutual security of Israel and Palestine.

The two-state solution is about true peace, not about the politicide and genocide of Palestine, or the continued attacks by militants on Israel. It is time for both Palestinians and Israelis to be safe, and for the US and Israel to give up the cruel delusion of permanently ruling over the Palestinian people.

"Sen. Jim Justice, R-W.Va., on Monday agreed to pay more than $5 million in back taxes after the Justice Department sued him over unpaid funds from more than 15 years ago.

The suit, filed Monday in the Southern District of West Virginia, said Justice and his wife had been contacted by the Treasury Department and were given notice of their 2009 debt but “have neglected or refused to make full payment of those assessments to the United States.”

The suit asked that the former billionaire and his wife pay the amount owed and any relief the court “deems just and proper.”

A filing later on Monday said the DOJ and the Justices had settled, with the couple agreeing to pay the full amount owed. A judge still needs to sign off on the agreement.

Justice's congressional office did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday night.

Bloomberg Law first reported the lawsuit.

The IRS last month filed liens against Justice and his wife of more than $8 million on unpaid taxes dating to 2009. Separately, a judge last year ordered six of Justice’s family companies to be sold to satisfy outstanding debt.

Justice’s family owns the Greenbrier Resort in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, which narrowly avoided foreclosure last year after the family settled debts.

Speaking with local media in October, Justice said that his companies “are complicated and complex” and that his children “are doing a magnificent job” running them, while alleging that collection efforts against him are politically motivated, The Associated Press reported at the time.

Justice has been a senator since January, when he succeeded Joe Manchin, a Democrat. He was governor from 2017 to 2025. Before he was governor, he was known as the heir to the West Virginia coal company Bluestone.

Justice defeated his Democratic opponent last year by more than 40 percentage points, a margin similar to President Donald Trump’s victory in the state that year.",literal
"Fletcher fought for greater recognition of one of the deadliest incidents of race violence in US history.

Viola Ford Fletcher, one of the last survivors of Oklahoma’s 1921 Tulsa Massacre, has died at age 111.

Despite her advanced age, Fletcher was a well-known activist thanks to her work trying to win justice for the victims of one of the worst episodes of racial violence in United States history.

“Today, our city mourns the loss of Mother Viola Fletcher. She was a survivor of one of the darkest chapters in our city’s history and endured more than anyone should,” Tulsa Mayor Monroe Nichols wrote in a Facebook post. “Mother Fletcher carried 111 years of truth, resilience, and grace and was a reminder of how far we’ve come and how far we must still go.”

Fletcher was seven years old at the time of the Tulsa Massacre in Oklahoma, a state living under the Jim Crow system that segregated the US South from the end of the 1800s until the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s.

The massacre began on May 31, 1921, when police arrested 19-year-old Dick Rowland, a Black shoeshiner, over allegations that he had assaulted a white woman, according to a report by the US Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division.

As a survivor of the Tulsa Race Massacre, Viola Ford Fletcher bravely shared her story so that we’d never forget this painful part of our history.

When a group of white men gathered at the courthouse calling for Rowland to be lynched, a group of Black men from a nearby community responded and tried to protect him before “all hell broke out”, the report said.

Over the next two days, vigilante groups and law enforcement looted and burned down 35 blocks of Tulsa’s Greenwood District, which was then home to one of the wealthiest Black communities in the US. The Bureau of Labour Statistics in 2024 estimated that the scale of the damage was around $32.2m when adjusted for inflation.

As many as 300 residents of Tulsa were killed and another 700 injured, the report said, although the final tally is unknown because many were buried in unmarked graves.

Survivors like Fletcher and her family were forced to leave the area. Left destitute, her family became sharecroppers, a form of subsistence work where farmers give over almost all their harvest to their landlord.

Rowland was never charged, after Sarah Page, the lift operator he was accused of assaulting, said that she did not want to prosecute the case.

Despite the scale of devastation, the Tulsa Massacre received limited national attention until Oklahoma state launched an investigative commission in 1997. Efforts to win compensation for victims in 2001, however, failed due to the statute of limitations.

On the centennial anniversary of the massacre, Fletcher testified before the US Congress in 2021 about her experiences and co-authored a memoir, Don’t Let Them Bury My Story, with her grandson in 2023.

Fletcher was mourned by US leaders like former President Barack Obama.

"Opinion: Our backgrounds and beliefs may vary, but we're all American

It is daunting to try to recall all the politically motivated attacks, and attempted attacks, in America over the last few years.

This year alone: someone set fire to the Pennsylvania's governor's residence while Governor Josh Shapiro and his family slept upstairs.

Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim, Israeli embassy workers, were shot and killed in Washington, D.C.

82-year-old Karen Diamond died, and several others were burned, in a fire-bombing attack on a march in Boulder, Colorado.

A week after that, Minnesota State Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, were shot and killed at their home. The Hortmans' killer also shot State Senator John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, who survived.

Last year, there were two attempts to assassinate Donald Trump during his presidential campaign. One bullet only narrowly missed its mark, grazing Trump's ear. But a supporter sitting behind him was killed.

Early in 2022, someone tried to shoot Craig Greenberg, then running for mayor of Louisville. The bullets came close, but missed.

That summer, a man was arrested outside the home of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, with plans to assassinate the Justice.

In the fall, Paul Pelosi, husband of then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was attacked with a hammer inside the couple's San Francisco home.

We may have vivid memories of rioters storming the U.S. Capitol on January 6th, 2021, trying to prevent a joint session of Congress from certifying the votes of the Electoral College.

But do we remember that the same day, pipe bombs were found outside both the Democratic and Republican National Committee headquarters, where they could have exploded and killed people?

Or that in 2020, the FBI uncovered a plot to kidnap the Governor of Michigan, Gretchen Whitmer? And in 2017, a man shot up a congressional baseball practice in northern Virginia, wounding four people including Congressman Steve Scalise?

I am sure there are more examples I haven't mentioned. Different sides seem to keep their own lists of losses.

"New York’s mayor election has drawn global attention as it pits progressivism against populism and establishment power.

It’s a dramatic race to the finish line between traditional politics and a new-age, people-powered-social-media-powered campaign, as New York City prepares to vote for its next mayor.

New Yorkers will head to the polls on November 4 as a three-way mayoral race, between Democrat Zohran Mamdani, former Democratic governor and now independent Andrew Cuomo, and Republican Curtis Sliwa, draws global attention.

New York City holds mayoral elections every four years, with a two-term limit for any individual. But this year’s contest is notable for its three-way dynamic, bringing progressive, establishment and conservative forces to face off in the country’s largest city.

Here are five maps and charts to help you understand New York City and how the vote works.

How big is New York City?

New York City is the most populous city in the United States, with a population of nearly 8.5 million people as of July 2024.

It is also the most densely populated city in the country, with about 11,314 residents per square kilometre (29,303 residents per square mile).

The East Coast city comprises five boroughs, which are administrative divisions equivalent to counties.

They include:

The Bronx: The birthplace of hip-hop and home to Yankee Stadium. It is also home to 1.35 million people across 110sq km (42sq miles). The annual median income is $28,664, while renting a one-bedroom apartment costs $2,100 on average per month, making that about $25,200 annually.

Brooklyn: Known for its arts scene, quirky, diverse neighbourhoods, and the Brooklyn Bridge. It is home to 2.56 million people across 180sq km (71sq miles). Brooklyn has the third-highest annual median income of the five boroughs at $41,171, and a one-bedroom apartment averages $2,800 per month, which makes $33,600 annually.

Manhattan: The economic and cultural centre of the city, home to Wall Street, Broadway, and Central Park, it’s a main character in many US television shows and movies. It is home to 1.59 million people across 59sq km (23sq miles). Manhattan has the highest annual median income of $61,439 but also has the highest rental rates, averaging $4,200 per month for a one-bedroom apartment, which is $50,400 per year.

Queens: The largest of the boroughs and home to two major airports – JFK International and LaGuardia. It is also home to 2.56 million people across 280sq km (109 sq miles). The annual median income is $40,549 and renting a one-bedroom apartment costs $2,700 per month on average, almost $32,400 annually.

Staten Island: Accessible by ferry from Lower Manhattan, this historic suburban borough, known for its parks and historical sites, is home to nearly 500,000 people across 152sq km (59sq miles). The annual median income is the second highest at $47,218, and renting a one-bedroom apartment costs $2,000 per month on average, which is $24,000 per year.

Together, the five boroughs cover a surface area of about 778.2 square kilometres (300 square miles) which is about the same size as Memphis in Tennessee, Berlin in Germany, or Singapore.

Who are New Yorkers?

At 38.8 years, New York City’s median age is slightly lower than the national median age of 39.2, reflecting its younger, more urban population.

The largest age group in New York City is that of 30-34 year olds (8.49 percent), followed by 25-29 year olds (8.02 percent), and 35-39 year olds (7.26 percent). Together, they make up nearly a quarter of the city’s total population.

New York City has slightly more females (4.29 million) than males (3.96 million).

New York City is widely regarded as one of the most diverse cities in the world, with residents speaking more than 200 languages.

According to City of New York data, 37 percent of New Yorkers were born outside the United States, and as many as 49 percent speak a language other than English at home.

Additionally, almost half of the city’s businesses are owned by immigrants.

At the time of the 2020 census, 30.9 percent of New Yorkers were white, followed by Hispanics at 28.3 percent, Blacks at 20.2 percent, and Asians at 15.6 percent. Residents identifying as two or more races, or other groups, including Native Americans, Pacific Islanders, and Hawaiians, make up the remaining five percent of the city.

The different boroughs, however, do not replicate citywide numbers, which vary greatly, and according to the 2020 census, are as follows:

Brooklyn population: 2.73 million

White: 35.4%

Black: 26.7%

Hispanic: 18.9%

New York City is one of 27 US cities holding mayoral elections on November 4.

The current mayor, Democrat Eric Adams, who has been in office since January 2022, withdrew his candidacy earlier in the year following several controversies, most notably his federal criminal indictment on bribery and conspiracy charges, which was ultimately dismissed by a judge in April.

The last non-Democratic mayor of New York City was Republican Rudy Giuliani, who was elected in 1993 and served two terms until 2001. Since then, the city has consistently chosen Democratic mayors, including Michael Bloomberg (2002-2023), Bill de Blasio (2014-2021) and Eric Adams.

Following primary elections within the two major parties, the three leading contenders for mayor are now: Zohran Mamdani, 34; Andrew Cuomo, 67; and Curtis Sliwa, 71.

Zohran Kwame Mamdani, 34

Mamdani is the Democratic Party candidate and also endorsed by the progressive Working Families Party.

An immigrant, Muslim and Democratic Socialist, Mamdani’s campaign has been focused on making New York more affordable, with rent freezes, free universal childcare and lower public transport costs.

Mamdani has been serving as a member of the State Assembly since 2021. His popularity has risen hugely over the past year, as the mayoral campaigns have got under way and, now, as early voting has begun. Nearly 370,000 ballots have already been cast as of Thursday.

The millennial candidate has appealed greatly to younger voters. On Sunday, he addressed a crowd of 13,500 people at the Forest Hills Stadium in Queens, with a promise that “New York isn’t for sale” – meaning it should be owned by the people generally, not by corporations and the “billionaire class”. Mamdani was joined by long-term Democratic Socialist senator, Bernie Sanders, and Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, New York congresswoman who won congressional elections in 2018 with record numbers.

Andrew Cuomo, 65

The independent candidate was New York’s Democratic Governor from 2011-2021, and served as the attorney general of New York from 2007-2010, US secretary of housing and urban development from 1997-2001, and assistant secretary of housing and urban development from 1993-1997.

The government stalwart has decades of federal and state-level political experience, but in his last term as New York governor, he was accused by 13 women of sexual harassment and was forced to step down from office.

An independent investigation by the Office of the New York State Attorney General concluded that Cuomo had sexually harassed multiple women. This included unwanted touching, kissing and hugging, inappropriate comments, and retaliation against at least one complainant.

Initially, Cuomo ran as a Democratic candidate for mayor, but lost in the primaries to Mamdani. Cuomo received 43.61 percent of the votes, and Mamdani 56.39 percent.

Cuomo’s political experience may resonate with older voters but, according to all the major polls, Mamdani is at least 10 points ahead of him.

In April, the New York City Campaign Finance Board (CFB), the campaign finance regulator, found Cuomo’s campaign had not provided evidence of digital donations, a requirement to qualify for public funds.

Cuomo’s campaign lost out on nearly $3 million in public funds as a result of this.

Then, in May, the CFB fined his campaign $675,000 for “improper coordination” with a supporting Super PAC.

Cuomo has been supported by billionaires William P Lauder, Barry Diller, Michael Kors and Michael Bloomberg.

How the voting works

Since early voting began on October 25, almost 300,000 ballots have already been submitted. So far, Mamdani has maintained a 10-point lead over Cuomo, according to the Quinnipiac University Poll. The RealClearPolitics average has Mamdani leading at 46 percent, followed by Cuomo at 30.5 percent, and Sliwa trailing at 16.6 percent.

Unlike in the primaries, in which voters rank their choices, New York City voters will mark just one choice for mayor. Candidates are listed by party on the ballot paper, so some appear more than once if they have been endorsed by more than one.

As of February, there were 5.1 million registered voters in New York City, of whom 65 percent were Democrats and 11 percent were Republicans. About 1.1 million voters were not registered with any party and voter registration closed on October 25, one week before the November 4 election.

In the last New York City mayoral election, just more than 1.1 million voters cast ballots – about 21 percent of registered voters.

To be eligible to vote, residents of New York must:

Be a US citizen

Have been a New York City resident for at least 30 days

Be at least 18 years old (you may pre-register at 16 or 17, but can’t vote until you’re 18)

Not be in prison for a felony conviction

Must not have been judged mentally incompetent by a court

Not have registered to vote elsewhere.

When do polls open and close?

Polling stations will be open between the hours of 6am (10:00 GMT) and 9pm (01:00 GMT on November 5) on November 4.

Timings vary from location to location in the city, but polling stations open between 8am and 10am and close between 4pm and 9pm.

Early voting began on October 25 and will end on November 2.

A full list of polling stations open for early voting is available on the Board of Elections in the City of New York website.

What else are New Yorkers voting for?

New Yorkers will also cast votes for the positions of public advocate and comptroller in citywide elections. Many districts will also choose a new borough president, City Council seats, judges and other local offices.

In addition to that, voters must vote in favour of or against the following proposals on the ballot:",literal
"Satellite imagery analysis by Al Jazeera’s fact-checking agency Sanad shows that the Israeli army holds about 40 active military positions in the part of the Gaza Strip outside the yellow line, the invisible boundary established under the first phase of the ceasefire to which its troops had to move, according to the deal.

The images also show that Israel is upgrading several of these facilities, which help it maintain its occupation of 58 percent of Gaza even after the pullback by troops to the yellow line.

While the majority of sites are concentrated in southern Gaza, every governorate hosts at least one military position. Some sites are built on bases established during the war, while others are newly constructed. The total number of sites in each governorate is:

North Gaza: 9

Gaza City: 6

Deir el-Balah: 1

Khan Younis: 11

Rafah: 13

One of the most prominent military points in Gaza City is located on top of al-Muntar Hill in the Shujayea neighbourhood of Gaza City. A comparison of images between September 21 and October 14 shows the base being paved and asphalted.

Where is the invisible yellow line?

Since the ceasefire took effect about two weeks ago, nearly 100 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli attacks across the Strip, with some attacks occurring near the yellow line.

On October 18, Israeli forces killed 11 members of the Abu Shaaban family in the Zeitoun neighbourhood of Gaza City, according to Gaza’s Civil Defence. Seven children and three women were among those killed when the Israeli military fired on the vehicle as the family attempted to return home to inspect it.

The Israeli military said soldiers had fired at a “suspicious vehicle” that had crossed the so-called yellow line. With no physical markers for the line, however, many Palestinians cannot determine the location of this invisible boundary. Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz has since said the army will install visual signs to indicate the line’s location.

In the first ceasefire phase, Israel retains control of more than half of the Gaza Strip, with areas beyond the yellow line still under its military presence. This has blocked residents of Beit Lahiya, Beit Hanoon, the neighbourhoods of Shujayea, Tuffah, Zeitoun, most of Khan Younis, and all of Rafah City from returning home.

What are the next phases of Trump’s 20-point Gaza plan?

According to the 20-point plan announced by United States President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on September 29 – developed without any Palestinian input – Israel is to withdraw its forces in three phases, as shown on an accompanying crude map, with each phase marked in a different colour:

Initial withdrawal (yellow line): In the first phase, Israeli forces pulled back to the line designated in yellow on the map. Hamas has released all living Israeli captives that were in Gaza, and most of the dead bodies of captives who passed away in the enclave.

In the first phase, Israeli forces pulled back to the line designated in yellow on the map. Hamas has released all living Israeli captives that were in Gaza, and most of the dead bodies of captives who passed away in the enclave. Second withdrawal (red line): During the second phase, an International Stabilisation Force (ISF) will be mobilised to oversee security and support Palestinian policing, while Israeli forces are to retreat further to the line marked in red, reducing their direct presence in Gaza.

During the second phase, an International Stabilisation Force (ISF) will be mobilised to oversee security and support Palestinian policing, while Israeli forces are to retreat further to the line marked in red, reducing their direct presence in Gaza. Third withdrawal (security buffer zone): In the final phase, Israeli forces are to pull back to a designated “security buffer zone”, leaving a limited portion of Gaza under Israeli military control, while an international administrative body supervises governance and a transitional period.

Even after the third withdrawal phase, Palestinians will be confined to an area which is smaller than before the war, continuing a pattern of Israel’s control over Gaza and its people.

Many questions remain about how the plan will be implemented, the exact boundaries of Palestinian territory, the timing and scope of Israeli withdrawals, the role of the ISF, and the long-term implications for Palestinians across Gaza and the occupied West Bank.

The plan is also silent on whether Israel gets to continue its aerial and sea blockade of Gaza, which has been in place for the past 18 years.",literal
"Sweaty, maddening, sleepless. That’s what it was like to be part of Cop30 in Brazil. And yet more than 190 countries came together in the rainforest of the Amazon and reaffirmed their faith in multilateralism, the Paris agreement and the need to redouble our efforts to keep global warming to 1.5C.

We went to Cop because working with other countries to tackle the climate crisis is the only way to protect our home and way of life. We know the UK produces just 1% of emissions, which is why, as the prime minister said in Belém, our government is “all-in” on working with others to reduce the remaining 99%.

We also know there are huge opportunities from driving the transition forward, which is why in Britain we are making historic investments in renewables and nuclear, upgrading millions of homes, and acting to protect nature.

It is true that Britain wanted more from this Cop, including details of how we would speed up the global energy transition through an agreement that explicitly pledged a roadmap for the transition away from fossil fuels. This didn’t happen because some countries would not agree.

Yet on this issue, we have seen the emergence of an impressive coalition of 83 countries from the global north and global south, backed by more than 140 global businesses and civil society groups. And Brazil will launch a roadmap to help countries transition away from fossil fuels and scale up clean energy.

This offers such an important lesson: that detailed negotiations matter, but the movements we build around them profoundly influence what can be delivered. The roadmap to achieve our goal to halt and reverse deforestation by 2030 offers the same opportunity to drive forward our global efforts to tackle the nature and climate crises together.

There is also a larger picture here. This year’s summit was a test of whether, at a time of political challenge, countries would keep working together on the greatest collective threat we face or, with the US stepping out of the Paris agreement, there might be a domino effect of others departing. For all the challenges, countries chose the path of cooperation.

Cop30 therefore forms part of the long history of these negotiations that have seen the world change its trajectory from 4C of warming around a decade ago to 2.3- 2.5C. Despite that progress, our goal is 1.5C for a reason – because the science is clear that every fraction of a degree matters in limiting the impacts people will face here and around the world. That is why it is important that the world has pledged to enhance efforts to meet it through the Belém Mission to 1.5 and Global Implementation Accelerator.

Ambition on emissions reduction goes hand-in-hand with finance to make that possible, including for developing countries. Last year, countries agreed that, by 2035, we would need to mobilise at least $300bn (£230bn) of climate finance annually for developing countries. This year, as a core part of our fight against climate change, we agreed that this finance needs to be targeted at aiming to treble the support to building resilience to climate impacts.

Our Brazilian hosts were determined to make this the implementation Cop – and much progress was made outside the negotiating halls. This was, of course, the first Cop in the Amazon, and the UK was proud to work with Brazil in the two years running up to the summit to help it develop the Tropical Forest Forever Facility, which offers an incredibly inspiring solution to global deforestation.

We also worked alongside Brazil and many others on the Global Climate Action Agenda, which is about building the coalitions spanning governments, businesses, cities and civil society needed to accelerate action on the ground – on issues from reducing methane emissions and phasing out coal, to unlocking investment in clean energy.

Thousands of British businesses were involved in these initiatives. Our researchers, universities, mayors and others were also deeply engaged on climate issues at this Cop. And the UK was key to delivering the final outcomes of this summit, because of our record of climate leadership at home and abroad, as well as the extraordinary skill and determination of our civil service.

The message coming out of Belém was clear: despite the noise, clean energy and climate action remain the foundation on which the global economy is being remade and rebuilt. We are up against the march of time and massive global forces that would slow down or stop action. In the face of this opposition, multilateralism is our best hope. For all its flaws, Cop has reaffirmed the belief of the vast majority of the world in this ideal. Those who would deny or prevent action are not winning the argument, they are losing.",figurative
"The 30th conference of the parties (Cop30), the annual climate summit of all nations party to the UNFCCC, just ended. Stakeholders are out in the media trying spin the outcome as a win. Simon Stiell, climate change executive secretary for the UN is, for instance, praising Cop30 for showing that “climate cooperation is alive and kicking, keeping humanity in the fight for a liveable planet”. But let us be clear. The conference was a failure. Its outcome, the decision text known as the Global Mutirão or Global Collective Effort, is, in essence, a form of climate denial.

In 2023, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) determined that the world had already developed, or planned to develop, too much fossil fuel to be able to halt global heating at 2C. It acknowledged that the capital assets built up around fossil fuels must be stranded – that is to say, abandoned and not used – if warming was to be limited to 2C. But the Cop30 decision text ignores all this. Indeed, it never even mentions fossil fuels.

This failure is all the more bitter because Cop30 had initially sent out so many hopeful signals that it would finally tackle the “transitioning away from fossil fuels” pledge from Cop28. Speaking ahead of the conference, the Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, said that the world needs “roadmaps that will enable humankind, in a fair and planned manner, to overcome its dependence on fossil fuels”.

Lula’s call was backed by about 90 other nations. “This is a global coalition, with global north and global south countries coming together and saying with one voice: this is an issue which cannot be swept under the carpet,” said the UK’s energy secretary, Ed Miliband.

After a press conference where 20 ministers and climate envoys demanded that the proposed language on the roadmap in the first draft text be “strengthened” and adopted, the EU circulated its own proposal for incorporating the roadmap in the final text.

By Friday, the number of countries supporting the roadmap to fossil-fuel phaseout rose to 89. Yet any reference to it disappeared from the second draft that dropped on the same day. Thanks to Cop30, the fossil fuel era will simply continue.

It seems clear that the petrostates, led by Russia and Saudi Arabia, fought against fossil fuel phaseout and won. If they feel the phaseout is an existential threat to their economies and their sovereignty, perhaps they should consider how the climate crisis is rendering the Middle East uninhabitable. The very week of Cop30, Iran’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, announced that Tehran, Iran’s capital city of 16 million, would need to be abandoned and re-established elsewhere, because, after years of climate-fuelled drought, its water has finally run out.

Surely these states are being supported in their fossil-fuel authoritarianism by Donald Trump, who is the president of the world’s largest producer of fossil fuels and who calls the climate crisis a “con job”. Even though the US was officially absent from the negotiations, Trump’s alliance with Saudi Arabia, and seeming affinity for Russia, underwrites their ability to advance their own energy interests.

Yet would this power be as great if the world’s “climate leaders” had more courage? It is remarkable that at the very moment the EU was supposedly fighting to include a roadmap to fossil fuel phaseout in the Cop decision, Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, was telling a press conference at the G20 that “we are not fighting fossil fuels, we are fighting the emissions from fossil fuels.” Not only does this statement directly undermine her own negotiators’ positions, it is in itself nonsensical – akin to saying “we are not giving up eating ice-cream, we are giving up absorbing the calories from that ice-cream.”

More to the point, von der Leyen’s language echoed nearly verbatim the words of Osama Faqeeha, deputy environment minister for Saudi Arabia, who told a journalist asking about the Cop30 roadmap that “the issue is the emissions, it’s not the fuel”. It has long been the position of the Saudis that the world could continue to use fossil fuels and simply remove the economy’s 600m metric tonnes of annual carbon-dioxide emissions with carbon-dioxide removal. But this is nothing more than fossil-fuel propaganda.

For one thing, the amount of CO2 that can be stored safely underground is limited. That the president of the commission repeats such nonsense reveals why attempts like Cop30 repeatedly fail: so-called climate leaders in fact evince deep ambivalence about phasing out fossil fuels, ultimately unifying global climate politics around the lie that we can keep using fossil fuels and still deal with the climate crisis.

But what of China? Isn’t China becoming the world’s first electrostate, stepping into the role of global climate leader with the US embracing fossil authoritarianism? Well, China seems to be ambivalent too, at least for now. China did not block the text on the roadmap to fossil-fuel phaseout, but neither did it fight to make sure it was included. Despite its dominance in solar, wind and electric vehicles, China acts less as a climate leader and more as an “all of the above” energy powerhouse, devoted first and foremost to its own economic development.

One bright spot of Cop30 is that Colombia and the Netherlands, backed by 22 nations, will independently advance a roadmap to fossil fuel phaseout, beginning with a conference in April 2026. This conference could be a gamechanger. UN rules require all Cop decision texts to be approved unanimously, giving the petrostates veto power over global climate politics. The creation of a fossil-fuel roadmap outside the Cop process may establish a trading bloc that could begin to sanction nations – and banks – that refuse to wind down fossil fuels.

Such a bloc will have no power if its leaders are not forced to resolve their ambivalence about phasing out fossil fuels. And that’s where you and I come in. All of us must do our part and subject world leaders to extreme and relentless public pressure. The challenge of stranding potentially trillions of dollars in fossil capital and rebuilding the world is enormous. Of course, global leaders and officials will take the easier, cowardly road if they can get away with it. As we cross the 1.5C threshold into uncharted climatic territory, we must make them fight wholeheartedly for fossil fuel phaseout. In the end, it is up to us to create a global politics that will finally save the world for our children.",literal
"Consider being a young homeless person on benefits today. Those aged 16-24 who can’t live at home often end up in supported housing. This could be a shared flat or a hostel, where specialist staff are on hand to help. But such young people frequently have to cover service charges and bills – at an age when they should be building a future, not worrying about basic costs.

It’s good that the state steps in to support vulnerable young people. But wrong that it can undermine that help in practice. For the last eight years, campaigners have warned that young people in supported housing are penalised more harshly for earning than their non-homeless counterparts – and it’s a UK-wide problem. For every £1 these youngsters earn over their small earnings allowance, their housing benefit is reduced by 65p, compared with 55p for those in the private rental sector. Perversely, the flaw crept in during reforms meant to guarantee people on benefits were always better off in work.

Penalising young homeless people who want to work more is clearly counterintuitive. Anecdotally, those in the housing sector say it causes plenty of young people to forego meaningful work. You can see why: someone working 10 hours could lose more than £100 a month for picking up an 11th hour of work. That can narrow their options, as they find themselves having to be prescriptive about their hours, competing with peers who can be more flexible. In the longer run, it can reduce their prospects. In some cases, staff find themselves in the unenviable position of dissuading young people from taking a job lest they put their housing in jeopardy.

For a government that wants to “make work pay”, this can’t be right. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has a chance to fix the problem in the budget. Young people have been the worst affected by rising unemployment, and while Ms Reeves has made the right moves – promising paid work for young people on universal credit who haven’t found education or employment after 18 months – those plans remain sketchy. It surely makes sense for Ms Reeves to ensure that incentives to work apply equally to all young people.

A new campaign, fronted by 150 youth and homeless organisations, warns of a financial “cliff edge” that makes rent unaffordable and increases the risk of arrears. Charities say the earnings allowance should rise from a token £5 to about £57, and the housing benefit taper should be brought down from 65% to 55% to match universal credit.

These are sensible, practical measures that would ensure that some of the country’s poorest people get financial help. It would also signal that the government is invested in making the country fairer for them. The homeless charity Centrepoint says it’s a win-win policy. The Treasury, it calculates, will gain £5m a year as more young people move into work. Once wider outcomes – such as improved health and reduced crime – are considered, the net gain is £13m annually.

There is a generational crisis bubbling under Britain’s surface in which young people face rising unemployment, insecure housing and falling real wages. Their futures, it feels, are being shaped less by opportunity and more by precarity. If ministers truly want to “make work pay” for everyone, they’ll have to explain why 30,000 young homeless people are the one group excluded from that promise. It’s time to act.",literal
"New IMF report prompts calls for corruption reforms. But experts say that needs political will, not technical tinkering.

Islamabad, Pakistan – A new assessment by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has concluded that corruption in Pakistan is behind an economic crisis driven by “state capture” – where public policy is manipulated to benefit a narrow circle of political and business elites.

The Governance and Corruption Diagnostic Assessment (GCDA), finalised in November 2025, presents a grim picture of a system marked by dysfunctional institutions that are unable to enforce the rule of law or safeguard public resources.

According to the 186-page report, corruption in Pakistan is “persistent and corrosive”, distorting markets, eroding public trust and undermining fiscal stability.

The report, requested by the Pakistani government, warns that without dismantling the structures of “elite privilege”, the country’s economic stagnation will persist.

While corruption vulnerabilities are present at all levels of government, according to the report, “the most economically damaging manifestations involve privileged entities that exert influence over key economic sectors, including those owned by or affiliated with the state.”

The report argues that Pakistan stands to gain substantial economic benefits if governance improves and accountability is strengthened. Such reforms, it notes, could significantly lift the country’s gross domestic product (GDP), which stood at $340bn in 2024.

“Based on cross-country analysis of the reform experience of emerging markets, IMF analysis projects that Pakistan could generate between a 5 to 6.5 percent increase in GDP by implementing a package of governance reforms over the course of five years,” the report said.

Stefan Dercon, a professor of economic policy at the University of Oxford who has advised the Pakistani government on economic reforms, said that he agreed that the absence of accountability in corruption cases was eating away at the country’s economic potential.

“Failure of implementation [of laws and principles of accountability] gives vested interests too often free rein and addressing this must be at the core of efforts for economic reform,” he told Al Jazeera.

Here is what we know about the IMF report, the areas of weakness it highlights, the policy recommendations it makes, and what the experts say.

What does the IMF report say?

Pakistan has turned to the IMF 25 times since 1958, making it one of the fund’s most frequent borrowers. Nearly every administration, whether military or civilian, has sought IMF assistance, reflecting chronic balance of payments crises.

The current programme was started under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.

The GCDA’s release comes ahead of the IMF executive board’s expected approval of a $1.2bn disbursement next month, part of the ongoing 37-month-long, $7bn programme.

Pakistan narrowly avoided default in 2023, surviving only after the IMF extended an earlier nine-month deal, which was followed by the ongoing 37-month programme.

According to the GCDA, Pakistan consistently ranks near the bottom of global governance indicators among nations. Between 2015 and 2024, the country’s score on control of corruption remained stagnant, placing it among the worst performers worldwide and within its neighbourhood.

At the heart of the IMF’s findings is the concept of “state capture”, where, according to the fund, corruption becomes the norm and, in fact, the primary means of governance. The report argues that the Pakistani state apparatus is frequently used to enrich specific groups at the expense of the broader public.

The report estimates that “elite privilege” – defined as access to subsidies, tax relief and lucrative state contracts for a select few – drains billions of dollars from the economy annually, while tax evasion and regulatory capture crowd out genuine private sector investment.

These findings echo a 2021 United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) report, which said economic privileges granted to Pakistan’s elite groups, including politicians and the powerful military, amount to roughly 6 percent of the country’s economy.

Ali Hasanain, an associate professor of economics at the Lahore University of Management Sciences, said the IMF’s description of elite capture is accurate but added that it was “hardly a revelation”.

He pointed to the 2021 UNDP report and other domestic studies that describe how Pakistan’s economic system has long served politically connected actors who secure “preferential access to land, credit, tariffs and regulatory exemptions.”

“The IMF diagnostic repeats what many domestic studies, including those by the World Bank and Pakistan’s own institutions, have already emphasised: Powerful interests shape rules to maintain their advantage,” he told Al Jazeera.

The new report notes that tax expenditures, including exemptions and concessions granted to influential sectors such as real estate, manufacturing and energy, cost the state 4.61 percent of GDP in the 2023 fiscal year alone.

It also calls for an end to special treatment for influential public sector entities in government contracts and urges greater transparency in the functioning of the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC).

The SIFC, created in June 2023 during Sharif’s first term, is a high-powered body comprising civilian and military leaders and tasked with promoting investment by easing bureaucratic obstacles. Although positioned as a flagship initiative jointly owned by the government and the military, it has faced sustained criticism for a lack of transparency.

The report describes broad legal immunity granted to SIFC officials, many from the armed forces, as a major governance concern. It warns that this immunity, combined with the council’s authority to exempt projects from regulatory requirements, creates significant risks.

Highlighting the absence of transparency, the GCDA says the SIFC should publish annual reports with details of all investments it has facilitated, including concessions granted and the rationale behind them.

“The recently established Special Investment Facilitation Council, which has been vested with substantial authority to facilitate foreign investments, operates with untested transparency and accountability provisions,” the report said.

Judiciary and rule of law

The report identifies the judiciary as another critical bottleneck. Pakistan’s legal system is overwhelmed by more than two million pending cases. In 2023 alone, the number of unresolved cases before the Supreme Court increased by 7 percent.

Over the last 12 months, Pakistan has passed two constitutional amendments, both of which faced severe backlash from many in the legal community who said that they represent a “constitutional surrender”. In essence, the amendments create a parallel Federal Constitutional Court that critics say will reduce the powers of the Supreme Court, while also changing rules that guide how judges are appointed and transferred, in ways that opponents say could give the executive great control over whom to promote and whom to punish.

The government, however, has insisted that the changes were made to improve the efficiency and efficacy of the judicial system.

Similar credibility challenges affect the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) and the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), the two principal bodies responsible for investigating corruption.

The GCDA cites a 2024 government task force, which found that NAB has, at times, exceeded its mandate and launched politically motivated cases. This selective accountability, the report says, has damaged public trust and created a climate of fear within the bureaucracy, slowing decision-making.

While NAB says it recovered 5.3 trillion rupees ($17bn) between January 2023 and December 2024, the report notes that conviction rates remain low.

The diagnostic calls for fundamental reforms to NAB’s appointment processes to ensure independence and a shift from “political victimisation” to “rule-based enforcement”.

Was the report necessary?

The IMF outlines reforms which experts acknowledged would be comprehensive if pursued by authorities.

Yet analysts also note that international institutions and domestic researchers have repeatedly made similar observations in the past, with little follow-through by the government.

Sajid Amin Javed, a senior economist at the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) in Islamabad, says the fact that Pakistan is already under an IMF programme may compel the government to take the findings more seriously.

He said that the IMF report could have gone further than it has by acknowledging that many of its recommendations have been made by others in the past, “without bringing any change”.

“Perhaps the assessment could have been made to see why these failures happened,” he said.

Javed welcomed the report’s attempt to quantify economic losses from corruption, hoping it might push policymakers to act.

“Corruption and governance are intrinsically tied to each other. Corruption leads to weak governance, and weak governance promotes corruption, making them conjoined,” he said.

Hasanain, however, was more sceptical, questioning why the IMF waited for a formal request from the Pakistani government despite having its own internal assessment mechanisms.

What can the government do?

Analysts said Pakistan’s economic landscape has long been shaped by politically connected actors who enjoy preferential access to land, credit, tariffs and regulatory exemptions. The IMF’s observations, they noted, are not new.

Hasanain argues that corruption, including elite capture of markets, regulatory bodies and public policy, is political in nature and cannot be addressed without deeper reforms.

“Without a broader political awakening, governance reforms will remain technical fixes built on unstable foundations. Ultimately, elite capture is undone only when political incentives change,” he said.

Javed, meanwhile, pointed to what he called policy design capture, arguing that those responsible for drafting governance and anticorruption reforms are often part of the same elite ecosystem.

“Elite policy capture on policy design is perhaps the most important component which allows the elite capture. The report’s recommendations show that we must go for participatory and inclusive methods to get out of our current conundrum,” he said.

For Hasanain, the most urgent reform is a unified economic turnaround plan that is fully owned by the prime minister and communicated clearly.

He said that Pakistan’s economic landscape was cluttered with “committees, councils, task forces and overlapping ministries”, each producing its own documents without accountability.

“The government should consolidate these scattered structures into one clear reform platform with defined priorities, timelines and measurable outcomes. Progress should be published monthly, debated publicly, and subjected to independent scrutiny,” he said.

Hasanain argued that such consolidation would improve coordination, build public trust and signal seriousness to investors.

For Javed, the most immediate priority is reforming the public procurement system, which governs how government bodies buy goods and services using public funds.

“Our procurement system is not working on value of money, but instead it focuses on quantity of money, where lowest bidder wins the bid,” he said, arguing that this approach meant that contracts often did not go to those best suited to deliver what was needed. “This system needs urgent modernisation.”

“An urgent realisation is the order of the day that if we need to have a flourishing, transparent economy, we have no choice but to overhaul our entire economic framework,” Javed said.",literal
"On their way to a Super Bowl appearance last season, the Kansas City Chiefs could do no wrong in close games, posting an 12-0 record in games decided by one score or less.

Yet the Chiefs entered Week 12 of this season just 5-5 and facing the possibility of having a losing record through 11 games for the first time since 2012 because they were no longer the league's best team in the clutch — 0-5 in one-score games.

That changed, finally, Sunday against Indianapolis. Trailing by as many as 11 points with a minute left in the third quarter, the Chiefs scored the final 14 points to beat the Colts in overtime, 23-20.

The win gives Kansas City (6-5) a 59% chance to make the postseason; a loss would have dropped that likelihood to 31%, according to NFL statistics.

""This is exactly what we needed,"" Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes said. ""Everybody made plays when we needed it.""

The narrow win wouldn't have happened without a defensive turnaround. After having allowed the Colts (8-3) to score four times on their first six drives, the Chiefs held them scoreless on their final four possessions, all four of which ended in three-and-outs and produced just 13 yards combined.

The circumstances suggested the defensive stand was unlikely. Kansas City ranked eighth-best this season in defensive points added and sixth-best in EPA allowed on dropbacks in the fourth quarter and overtime, but Indianapolis posed perhaps its most difficult offensive challenge of the season, having led the NFL in yards per game. Colts running back Jonathan Taylor entered the game leading the NFL in rushing yards, touchdown runs and total touchdowns.

But Taylor finished with a season-low 66 yards from scrimmage. And Indianapolis went nowhere over the fourth quarter and overtime even though it wasn't affected by the issues that had cooled its hot start. Quarterback Daniel Jones committed three turnovers and was sacked nine times in his first eight games, but in his last three games had seven turnovers and 12 sacks. The Chiefs didn't get a single turnover or sack but still held the Colts to 11 points lower than their NFL-leading season average.

Defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo ""had a great plan defensively against one of the best offenses in the National Football League,"" Chiefs coach Andy Reid said.

Kansas City has made the playoffs 10 consecutive seasons, the second-longest streak in NFL history. Continuing it was in jeopardy with four minutes left in the fourth quarter when Kansas City got the ball back backed up only 2 yards from its own end zone. When quarterback Patrick Mahomes found Rashee Rice for a 47-yard gain, it increased the Chiefs' probability of winning by more than 20 percentage points, per the NFL.

""You could feel the energy of the defense, of the stadium, and it was kind of that 'we're not going to lose this game,'"" Mahomes said. ""We're going to find a way to win. Even though not everything has gone our way to this moment, we're going to find a way.""",figurative
"Action film star appeared in more than 300 films in a career spanning more than six decades.

Dharmendra Deol, who became one of India’s most prominent actors and a Bollywood action hero, has died aged 89.

Survived by two wives and six children, Dharmendra had been ill for the past month. He died at home in Mumbai, Indian media reported on Monday.

There was no official statement from the actor’s family, but several of his contemporaries, including actor Amitabh Bachchan, gathered at a crematorium in the Mumbai suburb of Juhu for his funeral.

“A massive mega star, the embodiment of a hero in mainstream cinema,” producer and director Karan Johar, who cast Dharmendra in his 2023 film, Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani, (Rocky and Rani’s Love Story), wrote in an Instagram post.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered his condolences, saying the actor’s death marks the end of an era in Indian cinema.

“He was an iconic film personality, a phenomenal actor who brought charm and depth to every role he played. The manner in which he played diverse roles struck a chord with countless people,” Modi wrote on social media.

Top actor of his generation

Known to his legion of fans by his first name, Dharmendra acted in more than 300 films in a career spanning more than six decades.

Often called Bollywood’s “He-Man”, Dharmendra combined the old-school heroism of an action star with the tenderness of a romantic lead, making him one of India’s most iconic actors.

Born in Punjab province in 1935, Dharmendra won a talent show organised by a film magazine, moving to Mumbai and acting in his first film in 1960.

In the years that followed, he appeared in everything from arthouse films to soft romances, action films and goofy comedies, making him a top actor of his generation.

Notable films included Bollywood cult classic Sholay (Embers), in which he played one half of a team of small-time thugs tasked with catching a bandit. The film, which was released in 1975, has become part of Indian popular culture, and Dharmendra’s dialogue from the film has influenced movies ever since.

Dharmendra married his first wife, Prakash Kaur, before he found fame.

After starring alongside Hema Malini in several films, he married her in 1980, without divorcing Kaur.

He was a member of the Indian parliament from 2004 to 2009.",literal
"'Reflections in Black' celebrates history of Black photography with expanded issue

For decades, Deborah Willis has dedicated her career to unearthing, cataloging and showcasing Black photographers and photographs of Black people. The MacArthur ""Genius Award"" winner is the author of a spectacular collection of books including the seminal Reflections in Black: A History of Black Photographers, 1840 to the Present.

Twenty-five years after its publication, a new edition of Reflections in Black is out with 130 new images and a gallery show inspired by the book. In the expansion of this book, Willis considered the effects of migration and the importance of images for people forced to leave home.

""The aspect of migration is a central way of me reading these images, today there are so many people who are from the diaspora that are photographers now,"" she said. ""When families had to leave home, with disaster today, what do you take with you now? Photographs are what people are taking.""

Morning Edition's Michel Martin visited Willis at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, where she teaches and leads the photo department.

Here are four takeaways from their conversation.

1. Willis' upbringing shaped her love for photography

toggle caption Estate of Dr. James K. Hill, Washington, D.C.

Willis grew up in North Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where her mother had a beauty shop and kept what Willis calls: ""the Black color wheel of magazines.""

The publications included Ebony, Jet, and Tan and featured images that influenced her growing up. Her father, a policeman and tailor, was also an amateur photographer.

2. Reflections in Black started as an undergrad paper

toggle caption Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture.

Willis was studying at the Philadelphia College of Art (the college merged with another institution to become the University of the Arts in Philadelphia in 1985. UArts closed its doors in 2024) when she asked a professor why Black photographers were missing from the history books.

""Where are the Black photographers?"" she recalled. That question morphed into the monumental project that became Reflections in Black. She began her research by reading city directories.

""Because of segregation in the 19th century, I was able to identify with the asterisk the colored photographers … I created this list of 500,"" she said.

She took that list to the Schomburg Center in Harlem, where she found some of the photographers' images and created portfolios for each one. Later, with the help of Richard Newman, her ""publishing angel,"" the paper she wrote as an undergraduate grew into a book.

3. Frederick Douglass understood photography as biography

Frederick Douglass was one of the most photographed people during the 19th century. The writer and abolitionist is known to have had about 160 photographs and portraits made of him.

""I believe in reading his words that photography was biography,"" Willis said. ""We've not found a photograph of him smiling."" She emphasized Douglass himself collaborated with the photographer behind the lens in part as an effort to counter degrading images of Black people.

4. Willis searched for ""The Exhibit of American Negroes,"" which W.E.B. Du Bois organized for the 1900 Paris Exposition

Wills first heard about the exhibit in the 1970s, when she went to the Library of Congress looking for photographs from it. She said staff told her the photographs didn't exist.

Twenty years later, photographs from the exhibit were retrieved by a young Black man working in the archives. ""They didn't exist because they weren't processed,"" Willis told NPR.

Du Bois, she said, understood the importance of photography and often asked, ""Why aren't there more Black photographers, Black men studying photography?""

"When I was little, I thought hell was a fiery pit beneath the Earth’s surface. The image was vivid: flames, tortured souls and a cartoonish devil with a pitchfork.

Now that I’m an adult, I know better. Hell is actually a parent WhatsApp group.

The parent WhatsApp group – known colloquially as Satan’s Slack channel – is one of those parenting surprises no one warns you about. People tell you about the sleepless nights, the lost identity and the toys that reproduce overnight. But no one says: “You’ll one day discuss nits with 30 adults as though global peace depends on it.”

What began as a simple way to share school updates has mutated into a relentless stream of chatter. There are simply too many messages. You wake up to messages, you go to sleep to messages, you duck into a meeting and come back to 64 unread notes about sunscreen. Linda has posted the same information seven times because she doesn’t trust anyone to read it. Which, to be fair, is accurate.

When I was growing up my parents got information the old-fashioned way: crumpled notes in backpacks and gossip at pickup. They weren’t part of a digital micro-community of helicopter-adjacent strangers debating uniform policy. They didn’t refresh their phones at 9.38pm to discover that it’s going to be Harmony Day and every child needs to wear “something representing their heritage”.

My parents didn’t live in constant communication with other parents. They weren’t expected to be this connected, worrying about real-time reminders. And maybe, I’m going out on a limb here, that distance was healthy.

I don’t say this lightly … I think WhatsApp is ruining parenting.

I don’t think it’s evil, per se. In fact, it’s one of my favourite apps for keeping in touch with friends abroad. But the problem is: it’s always on. School parenting used to happen at drop-off, pickup and during homework battles at the dinner table. Now it happens first thing in the morning in bed, 11 minutes later in the bathroom and while sprinting through Kmart before school to find a T-shirt that screams “my child is Cuban-Italian”.

There’s no off switch. Go offline for an hour and suddenly everyone else knows that swimming starts this week, not next, that the assembly has been moved (again), and that Sharon’s selling year 1 tea towels for charity and you were supposed to submit your child’s portrait last Tuesday.

These groups are built for people who are permanently available and find deep meaning in the phrase “quick reminder”. They are not built for me. Or anyone with boundaries. Or a child.

Here’s the hypocrisy of it all: we limit our kids’ screen time, tell them to be present and post quotes about how “childhood is a short season” to our 600 Instagram followers. Then we feel pressured to check our WhatsApp 16 times a day, watching the theatre of parenting confusion unfold in real time.

And it is theatre. The WhatsApp group act is part coordination, part performance. Every “thanks for the reminder” is less about gratitude and more about signalling: “I’m a good parent too, I swear.” Even if I forgot the bake sale once. Or twice. Fine, three times.

I’m worried it’s making us all a bit dumber. Because if the information lives in the group, we stop paying real attention. We rely on the collective brain, on someone else (probably Linda) to notice, remind and repost. It’s the parenting equivalent of a get-out-of-jail-free card. Maybe things would be simpler if our only option was talking to people in public.

The worst part? I’ve become complicit. I can’t quit. Somewhere along the way, I volunteered to be the WhatsApp rep for my daughter’s class. I haven’t slept properly since.

I used to worry about my heart health. Now I worry I’ll die suddenly and come back as the eternal moderator of every year 2 WhatsApp group, trapped forever between reminding people about permission slips and guilt-tripping them about class fundraisers.

All I want is a note in the backpack or a quick chat at pickup. I’m craving an actual conversation with a teacher instead of ignoring her because I’ve already checked WhatsApp four times between leaving my car and getting to the gate.

I want a little space back. A crack in the digital noise. I miss the quiet confidence of not knowing everything all the time. The small mystery of what happens to my kids between drop-off and pickup. The trust that things will be fine, even if I’m not across every single message.

Maybe that’s the real lesson of modern parenting? Not to be more connected but to remember that it’s OK to step back. That missing something isn’t failing. It’s freedom.",literal
"No casualties reported, but local resident of Afar region says impact of eruption ‘felt like a sudden bomb had been thrown’.

A long-dormant volcano in northern Ethiopia has erupted, sending plumes of ash across the Red Sea towards Yemen and Oman.

The Hayli Gubbi volcano in the Afar region of Ethiopia, located about 800 kilometres (500 miles) northeast of Addis Ababa, erupted for several hours on Sunday morning, leaving the nearby village of Afdera covered in ash.

There were no casualties from the eruption, which sent thick plumes of smoke up to 14km (nine miles) into the sky, sending ash clouds to Yemen, Oman, India, and northern Pakistan, according to the Toulouse Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre (VAAC) in France.

Ahmed Abdela, a resident of the Afar region, said it “felt like a sudden bomb had been thrown”. Many people who had been heading to the Danakil desert, a local tourist attraction, were left stranded in ash-covered Afdera on Monday, he said.

Mohammed Seid, a local administrator, said there were no casualties, but the eruption could have economic implications for the local community of livestock herders.

“While no human lives and livestock have been lost so far, many villages have been covered in ash, and as a result, their animals have little to eat,” he said.

The volcano, which rises about 500 metres in altitude, sits within the Rift Valley, a zone of intense geological activity where two tectonic plates meet.

The Smithsonian Institution’s Global Volcanism Program said Hayli Gubbi has had no known eruptions during the current geological epoch, which experts know as the Holocene.

"Science is a slaughterhouse. We rarely acknowledge the degree to which animal life underwrites the research that provides us with medicines, or the regulation that keeps us safe. Live animals were used in 2.64m officially sanctioned scientific procedures in the UK in 2024, many of them distressing or painful and many of them fatal. But the government’s new strategy to phase out animal testing – published earlier this month – suggests that in the near future emerging technologies can largely replace the use of animals in our scientific endeavours.

The UK previously banned cosmetics testing on animals, and has already taken steps to regulate and reduce their use in research. But some needlessly cruel experiments still take place: the forced swim test (FST) for example, in which a rodent is placed in a body of water it cannot escape and researchers measure whether antidepressants extend the time it struggles for life. The government says no new FST licences will be granted, in effect banning it. Similar targets are set over the next few years to end the testing of caustic chemicals on eyes and skin.

This is welcome, but there are many other widespread practices – such as giving mice tumours to research cancer – which most people would still consider acceptable, despite their obvious barbarity. When animal wellbeing is pitted so starkly against human benefit, our collective compassion has a limit. The government will succeed only if it can convince scientists and the public that these longstanding and trusted experimental methods can be replaced with something as good or better.

Fortunately, there are emerging alternatives. So-called organ-on-a-chip systems, which use lab-grown cells arranged into a miniature network that can simulate complex bodily systems, are already in use. And machine learning systems are proving as adept at predicting potential toxic effects from medicines as they have been at predicting protein structures. These approaches won’t always provide perfect insight into how a given treatment might work for humans, but of course neither do animal tests. Undergraduate scientists are still taught these classic cautionary tales: paracetamol is toxic to dogs and cats, while thalidomide was shown to be safe in rats.

Unlike the slogans and aspirations in its AI strategy, the government appears to have a real plan for applying these technologies. There is £60m in direct funding committed– and a focus on identifying specific animal research methods currently in use, measuring their effectiveness and validating animal-free alternatives that could provide similar results. And it is heartening that the strategy maps out several points over the next decade when specific alternative methods are expected to mature, rather than gesturing at technology in general as a panacea.

This is an opportunity for both scientific and economic progress. Animal testing isn’t just cruel, it is expensive and time-consuming. The EU and US have similarly committed to reduce animal experimentation, so there will be rewards for developing technology and knowhow that can be applied worldwide. But most importantly, there is a moral imperative to free these animals. Previous governments greatly reduced the number of so-called charismatic species – animals favoured by humans such as dogs and horses – used in experiments. Today, 95% of lab animals in the UK are rodents, birds or fish. Do they not deserve the same consideration?",literal
"For the last two months, US forces have amassed outside Venezuela and carried out a series of lethal strikes on civilian boats. The Trump White House has ordered these actions in the name of fighting “narco-terrorists” – a label apparently applicable to anyone suspected of participating in drug trafficking near Latin American coastlines. More than 80 people have already been killed in these pre-emptive strikes, and war hawks are calling for expanded military action to depose the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro.

Watching this play out, I am reminded of a passage from the geographer Stuart Elden’s award-winning 2009 book, Terror and Territory. In discussing how to study the “war on terror”, Elden observed that it did not make sense to study terrorism as something unique to non-state actors.

“States clearly operate in ways that terrify,” Elden said. “The terrorism of non-state actors is a very small proportion of terrorism taken as a whole, with states having killed far more than those who oppose them.”

A large body of research supports this claim.

Researchers with Brown University’s Costs of War project, for example, have found that US-led interventions in the “war on terror” from 2001 to 2023 killed over 400,000 civilians in direct war violence. They also show evidence that when considering indirect deaths – for example, people in war zones dying from treatable medical conditions after clean water or medical infrastructure was destroyed – death toll estimates rise to at least 3.5m. Moreover, even beyond direct war zones, a recent study in the Lancet found that sanctions during the same period were also extremely deadly, causing as many as 500,000 excess deaths per year from 2010 to 2021.

We have already spent decades terrorizing civilian populations around the world in the name of fighting terror

In short, we have already spent decades terrorizing civilian populations around the world in the name of fighting terror. This is well known, and yet the Trump White House is reinvigorating the “war on terror” anyway. Still more, it is trying to do it with even less oversight on the president’s license to kill than has been exercised in the past.

While on the surface Trump’s second term has been characterized by a disorienting barrage of executive orders and culture war polemics, the administration has in fact been running a cohesive authoritarian playbook aimed at conferring near limitless powers to the presidency. These concerted efforts have played out in numerous policy arenas from immigration, to higher education, to economics, to even determining who is a citizen.

Consistent with this pattern, Trump is asserting the same unchecked authority over the violent capacities of the US military.

As I have written previously, a key tactic of the Trump White House has been eviscerating the oversight of the courts, making it impossible to impede the executive branch from continuing to break the law, even when it gets caught red-handed. However, another frequent strategy – perhaps less visible, though equally anathema to a system of limited government – has been to simply sidestep oversight by asserting that, even when law in theory places limits on presidential power, the exercise of this power is still “unquestioned”; according to this thinking, the executive branch apparently has the prerogative to interpret what those limits are.

Of course, in a serious constitutional system, this would be preposterous. In practice, there would be no limits to presidential powers, rendering the constitution moot. Nonetheless, this is exactly the type of power that Trump is asserting over the military, both at home and abroad.

The court case related to Trump’s efforts to suppress protests in Chicago using troops sheds critical light on how this strategy works. Federal law allows a president to deploy troops domestically if there is a “rebellion” that is making it impossible to “execute the laws of the United States”. Accordingly, some lower court judges have reasonably blocked the deployment of troops, finding that the administration has been unable to prove that these conditions were met. Just look at the facts: protests had on average only been about 50 people at a time, and they have clearly not made law enforcement impossible since ICE – the federal agency being protested – has vastly increased arrests during this time.

True to form, however, Trump’s lawyers have argued that these details are irrelevant. In their view, there is actually no need to prove a rebellion is happening because the president has the authority to define rebellion anyway. In other words, the law might impose limits on how the president can use the military, but the president gets to decide what those limits are.

While lower courts have so far prevented this nakedly authoritarian legal theory from taking hold, the argument itself is still massively consequential: first, because an extremely Trump-friendly supreme court will hear the case soon and could very well endorse these claims; and second, because this is essentially the same logic that the Trump administration has used to justify killing civilians off the Latin American coast. Indeed, just as the Trump administration is asserting the exclusive right to define “rebellion” regardless of the facts on the ground – thus eliminating any real limits on the power to deploy troops domestically – the Trump White House is similarly asserting the unencumbered right to define “terrorist”, along with the corresponding right to take deadly action with virtually no outside oversight.

In public statements, Trump has defended treating drug smugglers as terrorists by citing the harm done by drug overdoses, in effect suggesting that drug traffickers are directly killing US citizens. Ignoring the fact that Venezuela doesn’t produce fentanyl, the main driver of overdoses in the US, Trump has even gone so far as to float the mathematically impossible claim that each boat strike has saved 25,000 lives. Of course, officials have provided zero public evidence that the boats attacked were carrying drugs at all, much less tried to explain how blowing up boats would have any impact at all on drug abuse in the US.

But again, why would they? The whole point of the argument is that such facts don’t matter because Trump simply has the unchecked authority to use lethal force. In fact, the justice department has suggested that officials do not even have to publicly list which foreign organizations are classified as killable terrorists, much less provide evidence to support this designation.

Ultimately, Trump’s actions in and around Venezuela are best understood as a new phase in the “war on terror” – an ongoing tragedy that has already had deadly consequences for millions – though now with even fewer guardrails. The bottom line: Venezuela is not just some chess piece in an abstract game of geopolitics, and we are doing a disservice to humanity if we let war hawks in government and media spin it this way. We are talking about real people, and as very recent history shows, countless lives are at stake.",literal
"Opinion: 'The Shipping Forecast' reminds us of the power of the human voice

""The Shipping Forecast,"" presented twice on weekdays on the BBC and thrice on weekends, is 100-years-old this week.

It broadcasts weather forecasts for the seas that surround the British Isles.

You may wonder: why don't sailors and citizens on the North and Irish Seas, and along the English Channel, just look at their iPhones for the weather? They probably do.

But the two-minute program is heard by 6.5 million people. That is more than the nightly audience for Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Kimmel, and Jimmy Fallon combined.

""The Shipping Forecast"" is a fixture of British life. It has been featured in songs from Radiohead, Arctic Monkeys, and Chumbawamba, and satirized by British comics and on TikTok. Seamus Heaney saluted the show in his poem ""The Shipping Forecast,"" in which he wrote, ""… Green, swift upsurges, North Atlantic flux, Conjured by that strong gale-warning voice …""

The edition of ""The Shipping Forecast"" that runs at 48 minutes after midnight on BBC 4 has been especially hailed for what I'll just call its restful qualities. There is something reassuring in the roll of old, Oliver Twist-ian names you hear: Humber, Biscay, Dogger, Fisher, Fair Isle, FitzRoy, Lundy, Malin, Rockall, Utsire, Mull of Galloway. Are your eyelids growing heavy?

But the persistence of ""The Shipping Forecast"" may remind us of how the human voice, even crackling through static, can fire up images, memories, and feelings.

Most of the millions of people who tune into ""The Shipping Forecast"" are probably closer to nursing a hot tea in a recliner than braving cold winds in a trawler. But that doesn't mean they won't welcome a chance to hear about waves, rains, gusts, and gales, or calm waters and clear skies.

So much of today's information and misinformation seems aimed to rile the divides between people, by age, class, culture and beliefs. The 100-year-old ""The Shipping Forecast,"" for two minutes, may remind us how time, and the elements, affect us all.",literal

A question hung over this week's meeting between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. What would President Zelenskyy wear to the Oval Office?

Last February, Ukraine's president wore a black Henley shirt to the White House, no jacket, keeping the bunker-chic look he's maintained since the 2022 Russian invasion. But the meeting got combative.

President Trump chastised President Zelenskyy as ungrateful for U.S. support. A reporter for a right-wing cable channel called out, ""Why don't you wear a suit? You're at the highest level in this country's office, and you refused to wear a suit… do you own a suit?""

Sponsor Message

President Trump ended the meeting and said of the Ukrainian president on social media, ""He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office.""

This week, President Zelenskyy changed his look. He wore a black canvas blazer over a black collared shirt, buttoned at the top. Still no tie — but his solemn clothing seemed to proclaim: let's have a serious conversation.

Even the reporter who panned his February wardrobe told Zelenskyy he looked ""fabulous."" President Trump added, ""I said the same thing."" President Zelenskyy told the reporter, ""And you're in the same suit. You see, I changed, you have not.""

Yes, men can get weary of being judged by the cut of their clothes, not the cut of their jibs.

Sam Schube, who covered the fashion aspect of the Oval Office meeting for The Wall Street Journal told us, ""I'm not sure there's such a thing as a non-political outfit — everything politicians wear, no matter how bland, sends a message.""

Winston Churchill famously wore an air-raid suit when he visited the White House in December, 1941, just after the United States had been attacked at Pearl Harbor. It reminded Americans that Britons were being bombed in their homes, and Europe faced a life-or-death crisis.

Sam Schube says President Zelenskyy has been working with a Ukrainian designer so that his clothing in public appearances, ""blends his wartime style with something a bit more formal. He looks like he's dressing not just for battle, but high-stakes endgame diplomacy.""

"A new feature on X has stirred confusion, anger and a wave of online sleuthing after users discovered that the platform was suddenly displaying the surprising locations where certain accounts are based.

Over the weekend, users noticed that clicking on an account’s join date now opens a tab that shows the country or region in which the account is located.

X’s head of product, Nikita Bier, teased the feature last month as a way to help users verify the authenticity of content they read and limit the influence of troll farms, which often run political accounts from outside the countries they target.

The issue of inauthentic or ""bot"" accounts has plagued the platform, formerly Twitter, and other social media sites for over a decade. Perhaps most notably, inauthentic accounts on Twitter and other social media platforms were allegedly used by a Russian government operation in the run-up to the 2016 election in an attempt to influence the outcome. The incident set off a wave of concern online about the persistent presence of inauthentic accounts, but detection methods to sniff out such accounts remained unreliable for years.

When tech billionaire Elon Musk took over Twitter in 2022, he promised to address the issues of ""bots"" on the platform, conducting several purges early in his ownership of the company that took down many accounts. Several studies have shown, however, that suspected inauthentic activity on the platform has remained at persistent levels since Musk bought Twitter.

The new location-revealing feature is a different approach to the issue.

As soon as it appeared live for users, X was flooded with viral posts showing that numerous high-engagement, MAGA-branded accounts that present themselves as those of patriotic Americans appear to instead be based overseas, including in Eastern Europe, Thailand, Nigeria and Bangladesh.

An account that calls itself “ULTRAMAGA 🇺🇸 TRUMP🇺🇸2028,” claiming to be based in Washington, D.C., is listed as being based in Africa. Another now-deleted account with a President Donald Trump-inspired username — “Trump Is My President” — was listed as being based in Macedonia. And an account with the username @American, complete with a profile picture featuring a bald eagle over an American flag, is apparently based in South Asia.

Users also attempted to target left-leaning accounts.

Some pointed to an unofficial account with several hundred followers that purported to represent the Democratic Socialists of America, which X listed as being based in Portugal. However, the real account for the political party has over 300,000 followers and is verified.

Some users pushed back against the locations listed on their account. Three accounts belonging to NBC News journalists showed locations that did not correlate to where they are based but to where they had traveled to recently instead.

X also placed a warning that popped up when a user's location is clicked on: ""The country or region that an account is based can be impacted by recent travel or temporary relocation. This data may not be accurate and can change periodically.""

While it's not clear exactly how X was determining users' locations, Bier posted Sunday night that the system was still evolving. In response to a post asking if the company had taken a shortcut and questioning its accuracy, Bier wrote that an upgrade would happen the next day.

""Accuracy will be nearly 99.99%,"" he wrote.

But the posts that stirred the biggest frenzy came Friday morning, when screenshots and screen recordings claiming that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security account was listed as being based in Israel quickly went viral. The department and Bier have both denied the speculation, claiming the posts are spreading misinformation.

X users circulated images and videos that alleged to show the location field displaying “Tel Aviv, Israel.” The account information feature abruptly disappeared Friday night.

NBC News did not view the account’s location before the feature went away Friday and has not confirmed the authenticity of the posts.

The situation comes amid mounting backlash from across the political spectrum to U.S. officials’ support for Israel, which many commentators have lamented as appearing to prioritize a foreign entity over America.

DHS initially responded with a meme-like image of Trump, looking stunned, which neither confirmed nor denied the discourse about its account location.

On Sunday, it followed up with an official denial.

“I can’t believe we have to say this, but this account has only ever been run and operated from the United States,” DHS posted. “Screenshots are easy to forge, videos are easy to manipulate. Thank you for your attention to this matter.”

Reached for comment, a spokesperson for DHS pointed NBC News to the same social media statement.

The account information feature returned soon after Friday’s brief shutoff, with Bier announcing a global rollout Saturday. But the feature, which previously listed both an account’s current location and its location on the date of its creation, no longer shows the latter.

Bier also responded to the speculation by telling a user to “stop spreading misinformation,” saying X’s account information feature was temporarily shut off “because the account creation country was incorrect on a very small subset of old accounts, due to IP ranges changing over time.” He did not clarify whether such an error was present on DHS’ account specifically.

Still, he responded to some of the posts showing the DHS account as being based in Israel, calling the claim “fake news.”

“Location was not available on any gray check [government] account at any point,” he wrote in response to one screen recording, which X has now labeled as “manipulated media.” “Furthermore, the DHS has only shown IPs from the United States since account creation.”

As of Sunday morning, however, the location information is available again on the DHS account. This time, it reads: “United States.” But DHS appears to be the only gray-check government account that displays the location where it is based, as other government accounts now display only their dates of account creation and account verification.

Bier and X did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Bier said in a post that there are still “a few rough edges” around the feature that should be resolved by Tuesday.

“If any data is incorrect, it will be updated periodically based on best available information,” he wrote. “This happens on a delayed and randomized schedule to preserve privacy.”",figurative

"Three security personnel are killed in an attack on paramilitary headquarters in northwestern city of Peshawar.

At least three security personnel have been killed when a suicide bomber and gunmen attacked the Federal Constabulary (FC) headquarters in Pakistan’s northwestern city of Peshawar.

“Three FC personnel deployed at the gate were martyred and four others were wounded,” said Peshawar Capital City Police Officer Mian Saeed Ahmad, adding that one assailant died after detonating explosives and two other attackers were shot dead by security forces.

Monday’s attack, which wounded 11 people, came less than two weeks after a suicide attack outside a court in the capital, Islamabad, killed 12 people.

Here is what we know so far and why attacks have surged in Pakistan in recent months.

What happened in Peshawar?

Just after 8am (03:00 GMT) on Monday, a suicide bomber detonated his explosives at the gate of the security headquarters, after which other attackers entered the complex, located in the heart of the city, according to local media.

About 150 security personnel had gathered inside the headquarters for morning parade drills when the attack took place, Ahmad said.

“The terrorists involved in today’s attack were on foot and failed to reach the parade area, and a timely response by our forces prevented a much larger tragedy,” he told The Associated Press news agency.

He said authorities had collected samples of the body parts of the attackers for DNA tests. He added that police are still investigating to determine the identity and nationality of the attackers.

Zulfiqar Hameed, the police chief of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, told the AFP news agency that “the attack has concluded, and a clearance operation is under way to determine whether any unexploded ordnance is present.”

Where in Peshawar did the attack take place?

The attack took place at the FC headquarters, located in a densely populated area on Sunehri Masjid Road in Peshawar Cantonment, a garrison area under the administrative control of the Pakistan army.

The FC is a paramilitary police force based in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. It was established in 1913 through the merger of two smaller paramilitary forces, the Border Military Police and Samana Rifles. It was originally called the Fron­tier Constabulary until it was renamed by the government in July.

What do we know about the victims?

Three paramilitary personnel were killed in the attack, Javed Iqbal, the deputy commandant of the force, said.

Additionally, 11 people were wounded. Asim Khan, a spokesperson at the government-run Lady Reading Hospital, said all 11 were listed in stable condition.

Who has claimed responsibility for the attack?

Jamatul Ahrar, a faction of the Pakistan Taliban, also known as Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, has claimed responsibility for the attack, the local newspaper Dawn reported.

The Pakistan Taliban have also been blamed for similar assaults in the country, which has witnessed a surge in such attacks in recent months.

The unrest has put pressure on relations between Islamabad and Afghanistan’s Taliban-led government. Pakistan alleges the Pakistan Taliban have been able to operate unhindered inside Afghanistan since the Taliban’s 2021 takeover there.

What happened to the attackers?

There is still no clarity on the number of attackers. AP reported there were two suicide bombers without mentioning the total number of people involved in the attack while AFP said there was a bomber among the assailants. Reuters reported there were three suicide bombers.

“Initially, three militants tried to attack the headquarters. One terrorist blew himself up at the gate while two others tried to enter the premises but were gunned down by FC personnel,” Ahmad told reporters, according to Dawn.

Have attacks increased in Pakistan?

Pakistan has seen an uptick in attacks in recent years.

The country has recorded 1,517 “terrorism-related” incidents this year as of Wednesday, according to the South Asia Terrorism Portal, maintained by the London-based charity Action on Armed Violence.

According to the portal, there were 1,303 “terrorism-related” incidents in 2024, 921 in 2023 and 630 in 2022.

Figures from the Islamabad-based Center for Research and Security Studies showed that 2024 was Pakistan’s deadliest year in almost a decade with 2,526 deaths in attacks. The victims included nearly 700 security personnel, more than 900 civilians and about 900 rebels.

How have authorities reacted?

President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the attack in an X post.

President Asif Ali Zardari strongly condemns the attack on the Federal Constabulary HQ in Peshawar, offering heartfelt condolences & praising the courage of security forces. He affirms that externally backed Fitna-al-Khawarij cannot weaken Pakistan’s unity, resilience or resolve. — The President of Pakistan (@PresOfPakistan) November 24, 2025

Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also condemned the attack in a statement, saying the sacrifices of the personnel killed in the attack will be remembered, Dawn reported.

"Melodic metalcore band Bad Omens are pulling out all the stops for their first UK arena headline tour. In the first five minutes, we’ve experienced huge riffs, pillars of fire and supernatural horror-inspired visuals. Formed in 2015, the US band found mainstream success in 2022 with their third album The Death of Peace of Mind, which embraced the kind of hooky pop songwriting and complex storytelling that made the band irresistible on TikTok. Although their fourth studio album is yet to be released, this tour represents their graduation to the same league as genre titans Bring Me the Horizon, who they supported last year. Opener Specter is enough to justify this step up: an anthemic recent single as atmospheric as the dry ice crawling around frontman Noah Sebastian.

Although tonight’s set list is rooted in metal, it showcases the band’s ambitions towards other genres, incorporating elements of industrial, electronica and drum’n’bass. This fluid approach is anchored by Sebastian’s supremely adaptable vocals, which switch from croon to scream to whisper, even deftly mimicking the flow of metal princess Poppy during their collaborative single VAN. Dying to Love is pleasingly gothic, Nowhere to Go is relatively perky pop punk, and Impose finds commonality between breakbeats and double-kick metal drums. Drummer Nick Folio deserves a particular mention for balancing visceral crunch with expansive resonance. The band’s willingness to lean into zeitgeisty pop sounds is key to their mainstream appeal: The Death of Peace of Mind is reminiscent of the gloomy R&B of the Weeknd, by way of Bring Me the Horizon – all falsetto and moody beats with heavy metal drops.

This unabashedly big sound and anthemic songwriting is well suited to arenas – but Bad Omens themselves are not, at least not yet. They’re more like consummate professionals playing a good reproduction of what’s already on record; it might be big-venue nerves, or how spread out they are, but there’s a lack of connection on stage, like a star and his backing band rather than a group with chemistry. And a reluctant star at that: when Sebastian asks the audience if they’re having fun, he doesn’t seem to be having that much of it himself.",literal
"Racism and economic insecurity can have a close relationship in this country. That is most apparent when Australia finds itself pulled into another so-called “debate” about migration. This is usually sparked by populism or attempts to blame complex issues like housing affordability on our annual migrant intake.

Across the country, recent rallies and commentary are blaming migrants for a range of woes, from the cost of living to housing supply. Politicians from various sides made similar claims prior to the last federal election. We’re seeing a rise in far-right parties platformed on anti-immigration rhetoric and racism. This rhetoric feeds on genuine economic concerns but ignores the structural forces driving economic insecurity and undermines the right to dignity, security and equality for all.

The Coalition is reported to be working on a new policy to cut migration. There is nothing wrong with discussing migration levels. The issue is when we are not having honest discussions about the rights to housing, decent social security benefits and fair wages. The debate needs to be courageous enough to require the wealthy and corporations to give fairly to help realise those rights and to interrogate a crisis of systemic inequality.

Taking the easy but misleading route of blaming migrants for economic insecurity only serves to stoke the already smouldering fires of racism. Migrants are dehumanised in this debate, and this racism has harmful impacts on their daily lives.

When commentary repeatedly frames migrants as a burden, a threat or the reason for economic hardship, it reinforces stereotypes that have real consequences. It ignores the fact that migration has been a bedrock of our economic success and that migrants on average contribute far more than they receive. Such narratives have historically paved the way for cuts to social security for all, harsher migration policies and a political climate where compassion is treated as weakness. They shape public fear, not public understanding. And when fear grows, racism grows with it. We must ask ourselves: who benefits when communities are set against each other?

3:33 Factchecking protesters' claims of 'mass migration' into Australia – video

For example, when racism is embedded in migration systems through visa uncertainty or inadequate workplace protection, it enables exploitation. Some employers take advantage of the fact that migrant workers may fear deportation or visa cancellation if they speak up. This means they can be paid less, work longer hours, or accept unsafe conditions as a means of survival. But this is not a “migrant problem”. It is a structural problem that affects the entire labour market. Underpayment in one part of the workforce drags wages down across the economy. It creates a false sense of job scarcity. It pits workers against each other while employers benefit. Migrant workers lose. Local workers lose. The only winners are those who profit from division and vulnerability.

If we truly care about lifting living standards, improving wages and building a fairer future for everyone, then we must tackle the root causes of economic insecurity rather than scapegoat those who contribute enormously to our society. One of the ways of doing this is for the federal government to endorse the national anti-racism framework which marks its one year anniversary this week. Strengthening wage protections, ensuring migrant workers can safely report exploitation and enforcing fair work laws – including a ‘positive duty’ where the onus is on employers to protect workers from racial discrimination – all benefit the entire workforce. When workers feel secure, when wages rise, when housing is affordable, when communities are thriving, racism loses its grip, and everyone wins.

We need to focus on the systems that create poverty, instead of stigmatising people for being disadvantaged by them. If we tackle the real and complex problems that cause economic insecurity, we can reduce racism, while making systems fairer for everyone. Migration has always been part of Australia’s story. What matters now is whether we use it as a political tool that drives us apart and obscures the real problems, or whether we choose leadership that brings people together and improves the lives of all.",figurative

John Irving's return to the world of The Cider House Rules headlines a publishing calendar so overstuffed with treasures, plenty of them don't even appear below. Those painful omissions include a pair of memoirs from celebrated storytellers and an investigation into big tech.

Queen Esther, by John Irving

Four decades since the publication of The Cider House Rules, the venerable author has returned to the Maine orphanage where he set much of his popular novel and its film adaptation, which won him an Oscar. Back as well is Wilbur Larch, the curmudgeonly heartbeat of the first novel, but the spotlight is not with him. This time the star is the eponymous Esther Nacht, a Jewish orphan whose unconventional arc leads a story that's unmistakably Irving — amiably peopled, compellingly plotted and, above all, compassionate for its characters.

Moffett's debut novel follows the arc of his narrator – an only son, natch – from the childhood loss of his father, through a complicated relationship with his mother, to an adulthood as the father of an only son himself.

""Washington is an enormously gifted author,"" reviewer Michael Schaub wrote for NPR in 2020, ""and his writing — spare, unadorned, but beautiful — reads like the work of a writer who's been working for decades, not one who has yet to turn 30."" Five years on, the novelist — now a truly geriatric 32 years old — has only refined his keen eye for complicated family dynamics. In this National Book Award finalist, it's a complicated mother-son relationship that takes center stage, as the estranged pair find themselves suddenly in close proximity, grasping for understanding half a world away from home.

The Land in Winter, by Andrew Miller

For a pithy pitch for Miller's latest novel, I defer to the judges who put it on this year's Booker Prize shortlist. ""It's a joy to read, a nerve-shredding pleasure,"" they effused about the book, which follows a pair of expectant couples forced to hunker down during a historically bad winter in the early 1960s. The cold of the setting does little to dampen the lively wit of those forced to bear it. ""Every character is there, watching, acting, wilting,"" added the judges. ""It's a real party; there are no extras.""",literal
"When I see the allegations of racism against Nigel Farage from his schooldays, I can’t say I am greatly surprised. There are those who believe that the Reform UK leader’s persona must have been developed to win over working-class voters, or the “red wall”. I know that it is quite in keeping with the sentiments expressed by plenty of young men in elite institutions like English public schools – the kind of men who run the world.

Farage was educated at Dulwich college from 1975 to 1982; there, fellow students have told the Guardian, he allegedly used racist insults about fellow pupils and sang a song with the lyrics “Gas ’em all”. I attended Eton a couple of decades later, but the attitudes of some of the people I encountered there were not very different. One pupil, having fallen out with me over some perceived slight, boasted that his great-grandfather was a slave driver. A Jewish friend who was there with me at the same time told me how common it was to hear “Jew” or “rabbi” being used to describe anyone who was thought to be mean with their money. When I later saw Old Etonian Boris Johnson referring to black people as “piccaninnies” with “watermelon smiles”, I thought back to the peers of mine who would erupt into rants filled with racist stereotypes whenever they saw the West Indies cricket team on the TV.

But there is another reason I am not surprised when I read about Farage’s alleged teenage behaviour. As grim as these stories are, just look at the damage that Farage has gone on to do as an adult, and the company he has gone on to keep. If you were looking in the school yearbook, wondering “where are they now?”, then under his entry you would want to add: “He inspired the country on a tide of xenophobia to leave the EU, a decision that most of the country either regrets or outright hates, and afterwards went abroad to get a standing ovation from the German far right”. What has truly changed since Farage’s schooldays is the society around him. We will get back to that in a moment.

For now, though, I am thinking about school. I don’t know what Farage was like when he was a teenager, but – in my own regrettable experience, and as I am reliably informed – the majority of people who expressed racist worldviews at school and university have not moved away from those opinions with age. If anything, they have become significantly more extreme in their outlook, viewing the era of Trump and Musk with relish.

And why wouldn’t they? Not only have several of my former classmates retreated behind their walls and gates, they are now fuelled by the various algorithms that send a never-ending stream of loathing to their smartphones. Just as a mosquito requires stagnant pools of water in which to thrive, so their stagnant social circles provide the perfect breeding ground for increasingly toxic strands of bigotry. I was recently at a university reunion and it was striking to see one man, who has somehow gone on to scale even greater heights of racial prejudice than in his student days, surrounded as if he were a returning hero. Most disappointing was to see an old and close friend voice deep and growing enthusiasm for the politics of Johnson.

Almost as disappointing was to hear of Farage’s visit to my old school and to hear that, in the words of one onlooker, Eton boys had cheered Farage’s “worst comments on migrants and Covid”, and had subjected visiting girls to “racial slurs” and “misogynistic comments”. When I saw this quote, my sympathies went immediately to the students of migrant heritage in that environment, especially the visibly foreign ones. The college said it had apologised “unreservedly” for the “totally unacceptable” behaviour, but it is difficult to understand what other outcome they expected. This is what Farage does; this is his skill. When it comes to stoking hatred, Farage is what is referred to in the football world – a world that, for shameless political gain, he is now pretending to understand – as a generational talent. He is a Pied Piper, leading his followers to a future that – for now, at least – they find absolutely exhilarating.

Where, though, is his vision of immigration leading the UK? To answer that we can look to the actions of senior members of the current government, who have already bent their policies to his will. The mood they have created is so sour that, as reported by the Guardian, “record numbers of overseas-trained doctors are quitting the UK, leaving the NHS at risk of huge gaps in its workforce, with hostility towards migrants blamed for the exodus.” For the longest time, the approach by European politicians such as Farage has been “if you don’t like it, then leave”. It should be no surprise that, increasingly, the response is “with pleasure”.

We return, now, to how the society around Farage has changed. We have long had a media culture that prefers its political shows to be populated by entertainers rather than experts, and that trend has accelerated in recent years. We are also now in an era when, every single day, the richest person in modern history – who, according to The New Yorker, is responsible through aid cuts for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of human beings – wakes up and amplifies the most extreme far-right content from the biggest communication platform the world has known, a platform he solely owns. In the UK, the soaring economic inequalities – supercharged by Brexit – have led to such scarcity that many voters are turning against those arriving in the country, blaming them for trying to steal more of a shrinking pie.

Of course, it is in Farage’s interests to stop people from focusing on who is actually using the bulk of resources, because the greediest consumers are some of his funders and friends. Farage’s ultimate message is simple: open borders for the super-rich, closed borders for everyone else. It’s not quite as catchy a slogan as “take back control”, but, as the reality of his true position becomes clearer, it may just take flight. If that does happen, then we will be able to say that the adults in the UK are finally taking Farage as seriously as several of his classmates always have.",figurative
"Tatiana Schlossberg, the daughter of Caroline Kennedy and Edwin Schlossberg and granddaughter of John F. Kennedy, has revealed her terminal cancer diagnosis in an essay published by The New Yorker on Saturday.

The 35-year-old has acute myeloid leukemia, with a rare mutation called Inversion 3.

Schlossberg said she was diagnosed on May 25, 2024, the same day she gave birth to her second child. Hours after delivery, her doctor noticed her abnormally high white-blood-cell count and moved her to another floor for further testing.

She initially dismissed the possibility of cancer and was stunned when the diagnosis was confirmed, saying she had considered herself ""one of the healthiest people"" she knew.

“This could not possibly be my life,” she wrote.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a cancer that starts in the bone marrow and quickly moves into the blood, according to the American Cancer Society (ACS). General symptoms include weight loss, fatigue, fever, night sweats and loss of appetite.

There are several subtypes of AML that are important in determining a person's prognosis, according to the ACS. Schlossberg's subtype —an inversion of chromosome 3 — is listed as an unfavorable abnormality of AML on the ACS website.

Schlossberg spent five weeks at Columbia Presbyterian after her daughter’s birth before her blast-cell count dropped enough for her to begin chemotherapy at home. Her care later moved to Memorial Sloan Kettering, where she underwent a bone-marrow transplant and spent more than 50 days before returning home for more treatment.

In January, Schlossberg joined a clinical trial for CAR T-cell therapy. She wrote that much of the treatment unfolded from her hospital bed as her cousin, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was nominated and confirmed as secretary of health and human services, a role she believes he was unqualified for.

Schlossberg thanked her husband and her family for their support and for countless days spent at her bedside.

“My parents and my brother and sister, too, have been raising my children and sitting in my various hospital rooms almost every day for the last year and a half,” she added.

Her brother, Jack Schlossberg, announced earlier this month that he is running for Congress. The 32-year-old is running for the New York City seat that has long been held by Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler, who in September announced he will not seek re-election.

Despite all of Tatiana Schlossberg’s treatments, she said, the cancer continued to return.

“During the latest clinical trial, my doctor told me that he could keep me alive for a year, maybe,” she wrote. “My first thought was that my kids, whose faces live permanently on the inside of my eyelids, wouldn’t remember me.”

Schlossberg is now trying her best to be in the present with her children.

By profession a writer, for several years Schlossberg was a reporter for the science section of The New York Times, where she covered climate change and the environment.

Schlossberg’s essay comes on the 62nd anniversary of her grandfather’s assassination, adding her diagnosis to a long history of tragedy within the Kennedy family.

John F. Kennedy’s son, John F. Kennedy Jr., and his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, died in a plane crash in 1999.

Ethel Kennedy, the widow of Robert F. Kennedy Sr., who was assassinated in 1968, died in October 2024 of complications from a stroke. She was 96.",figurative
"My interview with Jack DeJohnette didn’t start well. It was the summer of 2000 and DeJohnette was in London to play with Keith Jarrett’s Standards Trio. Referring to him in my first question as a “drummer” felt reasonable enough, but DeJohnette didn’t appreciate being pigeonholed and shot back instantly: “I’m a complete musician.” A few days later, sitting in the Royal Festival Hall watching the Standards Trio, a moment of transcendent magic thrilled me as Jarrett sustained a long sequence of repeated notes high up on the piano and DeJohnette powered the music forwards with a labyrinthian drum solo as harmonically searching as anything Jarrett had played. Complete musician indeed.

“The idea of improvisation,” DeJohnette told me, “is tied up in the very nature of our existence. We don’t expect our life to evolve without changing and we never know what’s round the corner – why should music be any different?” He further explained that each part of his drum kit he considered to be a musical being “in its own right”. He designed and tuned his cymbals to his own specification. Mix the sound of cymbals with the drums and then “you think harmonically on the kit,” he added. The sounds inside DeJohnette’s head could never be contained by the conventions of drum technique. He was also a pianist of considerable merit – who released a solo piano album, Return, in 2016 – and every facet of his musicianship seemed to be on display all of the time, until his death this week aged 83.

Many drummers tune their kit to a bespoke design, but DeJohnette’s playing exhibited a life-force that was entirely his own. To hear him play on What I Say from Miles Davis’s album Live-Evil is to marvel at apparently superhuman drive as he maintained an impactful funk/rock beat for 20 minutes. DeJohnette, who also played on Davis’s epoch-defining Bitches Brew, had by 1970 become the trumpeter’s drummer of choice in a meeting of mighty musical minds. His drums rooted What I Say deep in the Earth and allowed Davis, and subsequently saxophonist Gary Bartz, all the space they needed to explore, while DeJohnette packed his playing with rattling rhythmic asides – keeping a continual discussion with the other musicians.

His own 1968 debut album, The DeJohnette Complex, immediately proposed that his was a voice intimately connected with a jazz scene exploding in a thousand directions around him, while he remained doggedly independent. The compositions DeJohnette wrote for his album were harmonically ornate and asserted jazz/rock energy while also occasionally leaning towards free-form improvisation. He featured himself playing melodica, and his folky melodic inventions soared.

The DeJohnette Complex demonstrated that DeJohnette’s aesthetic was indeed delightfully complex and, after leaving Davis, he was signed to ECM Records. In 1976 he released Untitled, a hectic quintet album, but also Pictures in which he played piano, drums and organ, and duetted on some tracks with guitarist John Abercrombie, an album that was sparse and bare-bones in contrast to Untitled.

His 1981 ECM album with saxophonist John Surman, The Amazing Adventures of Simon Simon, became a landmark moment for both musicians, and a much-loved classic too. Surman and DeJohnette played their usual instruments while also doubling on keyboards and synthesisers, subsuming their own identities inside lavishly orchestrated soundscapes of pastoral tones. Another essential album was Oneness, recorded in 1997, which dealt up large-scale structures with pieces such as Free Above Sea and Priestesses of the Mist, their titles mirroring the elemental force unleashed by the music. Listening to that album around the time of its release, I was reminded of an earlier encounter with DeJohnette, when I heard his group Special Edition play in Leeds during the late 1980s. This performance was in no hurry to stake out its terrain, as ambient, slow-burn forms gradually telescoped towards rhythmic blows.

Talking to DeJohnette all those years later, these ideas of stress-testing form and scale made more sense. He told me how he loved playing those funk figurations with Davis because “I could sit in grooves and let them saturate me”, but also spoke of his desire to generate more wide-angled musical soundscapes, always open-ended and therefore healthy for the brain. He complained about the “safe confines” of pop music with its repetitive patterns. “With improvisation, though,” he said, “you’re open to a full range of possibilities. People are capable of being very creative but only seem to tap into their potential when there is a major earthquake or something. But if people were more conscious of our place within nature, stopped abusing the Earth and put things back into it, we would have a healthier environment and society.”

No question that DeJohnette heard his music as modelling those idealist aspirations. “Art is the spiritual equivalent of that purification, which is passed to us as energy – and all artists have to draw on that.”",figurative

"The US decision to lift sanctions on the Bosnian Serb leader allowed Russia to consolidate its influence in Bosnia and left Serbia out in the cold just as it was moving closer to the West.

In a stunning geopolitical reversal, on October 29, the United States abruptly lifted sanctions on Bosnian Serb leader and genocide denier Milorad Dodik – a known Kremlin ally who has long undermined Bosnia and Herzegovina’s sovereignty. The decision, which contradicts years of US policy, intriguingly coincides with the beginning of direct dealings between Russia and Bosnia’s Serb entity, Republika Srpska.

The Russians, who had long treated Belgrade as the only authority representing all Serbs across the region, have seriously undermined Serbia’s authority recently by acknowledging Dodik as the rightful representative of Bosnia’s Serb population.

The Trump administration’s unexpected move to lift sanctions on Dodik at a time when he is building a strategic relationship with Moscow signals a potential grand bargain between world powers, raising alarming questions about what Washington gained in exchange for effectively ceding half of Bosnia to Russia’s sphere of influence.

The unexplained reversal

The US unexpectedly removed sanctions from Dodik and his network. This was a sudden, unexplained reversal of a longstanding policy. For years, the US targeted him for trying to destabilise Bosnia, denying genocide, and pushing for secession. Removing him from the sanctions list appears to give a blessing to the denial of the Bosnian genocide and creates a clear path for Bosnia’s breakup.

This move creates a glaring paradox in US foreign policy.

Dodik is one of the Kremlin’s most overt allies in Europe, openly celebrating his ties with Moscow and advocating for Russian interests. However, the US keeps strong sanctions on many other people and entities for far weaker links to Russia.

The perplexing decision to lift sanctions on him exposes a troubling inconsistency in Washington’s approach to Russia, one that undermines the credibility of its broader sanctions regime.

Citing successful lobbying by Dodik as the reason for this reversal is a weak and unconvincing justification. According to estimates, Dodik’s lobbying efforts in the US have grown to two or three times the $30m figure confirmed for 2017. The scale of his spending, however, is still a pittance compared with the vast sums deployed by other nations and interest groups that consistently fail to achieve such spectacular diplomatic victories.

Another theory for the US policy shift involves Bosnia’s mineral wealth, specifically lithium. This follows a May 21, 2025, statement by Dodik, who publicly offered the mineral resources of the Bosnian Serb entity to the US in exchange for recognition of Republika Srpska’s sovereignty.

This theory, however, contains a logical flaw: if the US’s primary interest were lithium, maintaining sanctions would provide more direct control over the resources without needing to grant Dodik anything. The inadequacy of this explanation strongly suggests that more profound, undisclosed geopolitical calculations are at work, raising alarming questions about the true price of this sudden US retreat.

Moscow dominating Serbia

For a while now, Serbia has been moving away from Russia and towards the West.

On August 29, 2024, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic announced a $3bn deal with France to buy 12 Rafale jets, signalling Belgrade’s shift towards Western security alliances.

At a joint news conference, French President Emmanuel Macron praised the agreement as “historic”, lauding Serbia’s “strategic courage” and reaffirming its European future. This did not go unnoticed in Moscow. In May 2025, Russia accused Serbia of stabbing Moscow in the back for selling weapons to Ukraine. Furthermore, in July, the Kremlin condemned Belgrade for considering joining Western sanctions against Russia.

On the day before the sanctions on him were lifted, rather than courting Washington, Dodik was in Minsk embracing Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. By meeting Dodik a day before US sanctions on him were lifted, Moscow declared a new Balkan strategy that deliberately sidelines Serbia.

Back in September, Russia’s foreign minister described Dodik as the “legitimately elected president” of the Bosnian entity Republika Srpska. But now, the official website of Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs describes Dodik as “the leader of Bosnian Serbs in Bosnia and Herzegovina.” This new designation serves multiple strategic purposes and marks a clear geopolitical shift.

Advertisement

First, it undermines the sovereignty of Bosnia by asserting a national rather than a purely regional mandate for Dodik’s authority.

Second, it directly challenges Serbia’s ambition, embodied in the concept of Srpski svet (Serbian World), to act as the central patron of all Serbs, asserting instead Russia’s claim to be the ultimate arbiter of Serb political affairs. Belgrade’s Srpski svet mirrors the Kremlin’s Ruski mir (Russian World) doctrine, with both aiming to unite ethnic and linguistic kin under a transnational cultural identity. Ultimately, these ideologies serve to expand political influence and justify intervention in neighbouring states under the pretext of protecting their diasporas.

The most potent signal of this shift came from Dodik himself. He publicly snubbed Vucic by bluntly declaring that Belgrade would have no say in the Republika Srpska. Vucic responded by citing the affront: “The other night, I saw that in Banja Luka they say that no one from Belgrade will give them orders.”

For years, Serbia has positioned itself as the paternal guardian of all Serbs, with Republika Srpska operating firmly within its political orbit. Dodik’s statement shattered this dynamic, announcing that the Serb-majority entity now answers to a different patron.

Moscow’s move has publicly split Dodik and Vucic, weakening Serbia’s power. It shows Russia will now deal directly with Bosnian separatists, ignoring the Serbian government. For Vucic, who tries to keep ties with both Europe and Russia, this is a worst-case scenario. It proves his influence is no longer needed and that Russia is now working through Banja Luka instead of Belgrade, severely reducing Serbia’s importance.

Moscow’s power play: Annexing Europe’s ailing heart

The US decision to lift sanctions has effectively allowed Moscow to take in Republika Srpska as a new Russian territory. The era of indirect influence is over; the Bosnian entity is now being governed directly from the Kremlin, fundamentally altering the balance of power in Europe.

A Russian military footprint in the Balkans is also expanding. While Russia maintains unofficial bases in Serbia, it is now likely to establish one in Banja Luka, the de facto capital of the Bosnian Serb entity, as well.

Bosnia, located in the heart of Europe, is itself shaped like a heart. For 30 years, the European Union had the chance to heal Europe’s ailing heart. The EU failed because, at its own core, it is afflicted by deep-seated racism: Islamophobia and Russophobia. The price for this hatred is now clear. Half of Europe’s heart — half of Bosnia — has effectively become a new Russian territory, a territory from which launching missiles would be far more efficient than from Kaliningrad.

The global chessboard: A tacit US-Russia understanding?

The sudden lifting of US sanctions on Dodik, followed instantly by his strategic embrace with Lavrov, is best understood not as a US policy failure but as a calculated move on the global chessboard. Lavrov’s masterstroke was to publicly empower Dodik at the direct expense of Belgrade, a clear signal to Serbia that its historical role as the primary patron of Bosnian Serbs is over. In this new alignment, Moscow demonstrates that it holds the key to power in the Bosnian entity Republika Srpska, forcefully reminding Serbia who truly commands the loyalties of its supposed kin.

Advertisement

This power play exploits Serbia’s fundamental and precarious dilemma. The nation is perpetually torn between its economic and political ambitions for EU integration and its deep-seated historical, cultural, and religious ties to Russia. Lavrov’s move tightens the Russian noose, forcing Belgrade into a more subservient position.

This leads to the most unsettling theory: that the US acquiescence is part of a tacit great-power trade-off. The timing and incongruity of the sanctions lift suggest it is not a retreat but a strategic bargain. Washington may have deliberately ceded its influence in Bosnia, accepting an expanded Russian sphere of influence in the Balkans, in exchange for a strategic concession from Moscow elsewhere — perhaps related to Ukraine, the Middle East, or another arena. This fits a cynical historical pattern: big powers often ignore local commitments to serve their own secret deals.

The unanswered question and the fallout

The abrupt US sanction lift, followed immediately by Dodik’s pivot to Moscow, leaves one chilling, unanswered question: what did Washington secure in return for effectively gifting half of Bosnia to Russia’s sphere of influence? This opaque bargain sacrifices decades of principled Balkan policy for an undisclosed geopolitical price, undermining US credibility and the fragile Dayton peace.

The fallout is clear: emboldened secessionists, a destabilised Europe, and a dangerous signal that hard-won democratic norms are merely currency in a new great game, leaving allies betrayed and adversaries triumphant.

"GRAYS HARBOR COUNTY, Wash. — A Washington state man is believed to be the first person to die from a rare strain of bird flu, but state health officials said Friday the risk to the public is low.

The man, an older adult with underlying health conditions, was being treated for a bird flu called H5N5 after becoming seemingly the first known human infected by the strain, according to a statement from the Washington State Department of Health.

The man from Grays Harbor County, about 78 miles southwest of Seattle, had a backyard flock of domestic poultry that had been exposed to wild birds, health officials said.

“The risk to the public remains low,” the statement from state health officials said. “No other people involved have tested positive for avian influenza.”

Health officials said they will monitor anyone who came in close contact with the man, but “there is no evidence of transmission of this virus between people.”

Earlier this month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a statement about the infection that said no information would suggest “the risk to public health has increased as a result of this case.”

H5N5 is not believed to be a greater threat to human health than the H5N1 virus behind a wave of 70 reported human infections in the U.S. in 2024 and 2025. Most of those have been mild illnesses in workers on dairy and poultry farms.

The distinction between H5N5 and H5N1 lies in a protein involved in releasing the virus from an infected cell and promoting spread to surrounding cells.",figurative
"Mexican-American producer Delia Beatriz, AKA Debit, has a talent for making historical sounds her own. Her 2022 breakthrough, The Long Count, featured woozy, ambient soundscapes made from electronically processed samples of ancient Maya flutes. On her latest record, Desaceleradas (Decelerated), Beatriz turns her attention to the 90s trend of cumbia rebajada. Slowing the Afro-Latin dance genre of cumbia to a sludgy tempo, cumbia rebajada is a dub-influenced take on a typically upbeat, party-driven sound. DJ Gabriel Dueñez popularised the style with his bootleg cassettes; two of his earliest releases now form the basis of Beatriz’s experiments.

View image in fullscreen The artwork for Desaceleradas. Photograph: Modern Love

Landing somewhere between composer William Basinski’s Disintegration Loops and DJ Screw’s chopped’n’screwed production style, Desaceleradas slows the shaker-rattling, synth syncopations of cumbia rebajada into unrecognisable ambient territory. La Ronda y el Sonidero and Vinilos Trasnacionales contain hints of the signature cumbia shuffle and twanging synth melody, but Beatriz’s added tape hiss, reverb and melodic warping transform the style into an eerie, ethereal soundworld of nightmare fairground music and yearning drones.

Much more than just an academic exercise of slowing material down to its lowest possible bpm, Beatriz’s arrangements force us to focus on the innate strangeness of the present moment. On Bootlegs, a single synth tone becomes drawn-out, harsh industrial distortion. Cholombia, MTY highlights the atonal dissonance produced between the notes of a slow motion melody and Los Balleza rings out with cacophonous reverb.

Beatriz’s granular dissection of sounds means they’re constantly shifting, creating a sensation equivalent to sea sickness. This uneasy quality is the opposite of background meditative ambience. Instead, on Desaceleradas Beatriz performs a remarkable feat, showing how slowness and subtlety can contain just as much dread and discomfort as the chaos of noise.

What happened in Barcelona’s last La Liga match?

Barcelona secured a dominant 4-0 victory over 10-man Athletic Bilbao on Saturday in their first match back at their home venue Nou Camp since May 2023.

Ferran Torres had two goals for Barca with Robert Lewandowski and Fermin Lopez also adding to the scoresheet.

Athletic lost midfielder Oihan Sancet to a red card in the 54th minute after he was sent off for a crude challenge on Lopez.

Lewandowski, who scored the opener, said he will remember kicking the first goal at the team’s rebuilt Nou Camp stadium “forever”.

“Today was a special day, not only for me but for everyone. Because of this I’m very happy that I could score the first goal, coming back to the Nou Camp,” Lewandowski told Barca One.

“I have so much experience playing in different stadiums, but here is something special. I’m very proud of myself and also of the team because we did a great job today and we won.”

What happened in the last UCL League Phase match for both clubs?

Chelsea were held to a shock 2-2 draw by Azerbaijan side Qarabag in their last outing on November 5, while Barcelona had to rally from a goal down and split the points in a 3-3 result against Club Brugge in Belgium.

Where do Chelsea and Barcelona sit on the UCL League Phase standings?

Barcelona are currently 11th on the UEFA League Phase standings with Chelsea right behind in 12th position. Both sides have two wins, one draw and one loss from their four fixtures.

Teams need to finish the League Phase standings in a top-eight position to secure direct qualification into the round of 16. Those clubs that finish in ladder positions 9-to-24 will enter into a home and away playoffs to reach the last-16.

Where did Barcelona finish in last season’s Champions League?

The Catalan club were widely expected to reach the Champions League final but were eliminated by Inter, who staged a late comeback in the second leg of their record-equalling semifinal.

Palmer out of Barca clash

Chelsea star Cole Palmer is close to returning but will miss the UCL clash with Barcelona before the top-of-the-table Premier League showdown against Arsenal, Maresca said on Monday.

Palmer, who suffered a groin injury in August before returning with back-to-back goals against Brentford and Bayern Munich, was nearing his comeback, but an accident at home delayed his return.

The 23-year-old England international stubbed his toe on a door during the night, resulting in a fracture.

“Cole is wearing a (protective) boot,” Maresca told reporters.

“We don’t know when he will be back but for sure it will be soon. He’s already on the pitch, he’s already touching the ball and the feeling (for him) is good.

“I don’t think he will be available for these two games (Barca and Arsenal), but he is doing well.”

Barca’s Lopez showing summer suitors Chelsea what they missed

Fermin Lopez, 22, is establishing himself as a regular starter for manager Hansi Flick’s side, even though outside of Spain he is not yet a household name.

Chelsea know plenty about Lopez, though, having had a 40-million-euro ($46m) bid rebuffed by Barcelona in the summer. In Tuesday’s Champions League fixture, the attacking midfielder will be one of their main goal threats.

Flick was eager to keep Lopez, while Barca were open to selling him at the right price, which Chelsea did not reach.

“I’m convinced that he will stay, but in the end I don’t know what happens. We have to wait. I am really happy when the market is closed,” said Flick in August, eventually getting his wish.

Despite his improvement and obvious utility for Barca – or maybe even because of it – he is an asset the Catalan giants could cash in.

If he shines at Stamford Bridge, it would be no surprise to see Chelsea’s interest in the midfielder reawaken and his price tag rise further.

Form guide: last five matches

Chelsea: W-L-W-W-W (Premier League, most recent result last)

Barcelona: W-L-W-W-W (La Liga, most recent result last)

Head-to-head: Chelsea-Barcelona

The two clubs have faced each other 14 times, with both teams winning four times while six ended as draws.

The sides last met at the round of 16 in the 2017-2018 Champions League with Barcelona progressing to the quarterfinals 4-1 on aggregate. Argentinian superstar Lionel Messi was the standout in the second leg with two goals – including his 100th UEFA Champions League goal – on the night.

Chelsea’s team news

Oft-injured Reece James was taken off at halftime of Saturday’s EPL fixture at Burnley, but the Chelsea captain’s early finish was preplanned and not the result of a new injury, according to Maresca, so he is expected to be available for team selection.

“The idea was to manage Reece,” said Maresca. “This is the reason why he played 45 minutes [only]. It was planned.

“It’s not easy, because me personally, I would like Reece to continue, but we need to protect Reece.”

French centre-back Wesley Fofana, who was omitted from the matchday squad against Burnley, is believed to be match fit ahead of the Barca clash.

First-choice goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen will miss the fixture as he continues to recover from a back issue. Joan Garcia will stand in for the German.

Pedri (hamstring) and Gavi (knee) are unavailable for the La Liga champions.

Dynamic winger Raphinha, who returned on the weekend from a hamstring injury, is a strong possibility to regain his starting role against the Blues.

"Reggae pioneer Jimmy Cliff dies at 81

toggle caption Fabrice Coffrini/AFP via Getty Images

Jimmy Cliff, the Jamaican musician and actor who helped propel reggae into the international spotlight, has died at 81 years old. The singer-songwriter was known for hits such as ""Many Rivers to Cross,"" ""You Can Get It if You Really Want"" and the title track in the 1972 crime film The Harder They Come, in which he also starred as the main character.

According to his wife, Latifa Chambers, Cliff died due to a seizure followed by pneumonia. In an announcement on social media, Chambers wrote, ""To all his fans around the world, please know that your support was his strength throughout his whole career.""

Born James Chambers in 1944, Cliff grew up in a rural village in Jamaica, and began singing in school and in church. His father worked as a tailor, and hoped his son would study medicine. After being exposed to American music from New Orleans and Florida through the radio, a teenaged James moved to Kingston to pursue an artistic career.

His first major hit in Jamaica, ""Hurricane Hattie,"" referenced a 1961 storm that wreaked havoc in the Caribbean. In 1964, Cliff was selected to perform at the World's Fair in New York City as a representative for the island. The following year, British-born producer Chris Blackwell signed Cliff to his label, Island Records, and persuaded him to move to England.

Though he initially struggled to find his footing with audiences abroad, Cliff earned critical and commercial success for songs such as ""Wonderful World, Beautiful People"" and the protest anthem ""Vietnam."" Despite addressing war and tragedy in his music, the artist infused his lyrics with a hopeful outlook.

""I grew up economically poor, spiritually rich,"" Cliff told NPR in 2010. ""So even though I had this condition, that kind of balance made me always take the downside and kind of put an up to it.""

Cliff's career reached new heights when he was cast in the lead role of Ivanhoe ""Ivan"" Martin in the seminal Jamaican film The Harder They Come, directed by Perry Henzell. In it, Ivan is an aspiring reggae musician who moves to Kingston from the countryside, faces poverty and exploitation in the city and descends into a life of crime, eventually becoming a violent fugitive with a chart-topping single. The film features several of Cliff's songs, which helped turn The Harder They Come into a national sensation in Jamaica and an international cult classic.

""That movie really had a tremendous effect on bringing the Jamaican world, music and culture and everything, to the forefront,"" Chris Blackwell, who also served as executive producer for the film, told Fresh Air's Terry Gross in 2022.

Cliff continued to perform and record for decades, collaborating with artists including Elvis Costello, Annie Lennox and Wyclef Jean. In 1985, he was one of the dozens of artists featured on the all-star anti-apartheid song ""Sun City."" The following year, Cliff won a Grammy Award for best reggae recording for his album Cliff Hanger.

In 2010, he became the second reggae artist, after Bob Marley, to be inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. Two years later, Cliff reintroduced himself — and reggae — to the world with his album Rebirth, which would go on to win a Grammy for best reggae album in 2013.

In an interview with NPR, Cliff described that album as a revitalization of his artistic vision, which necessitated going back to the sound that first launched his career from the studios of Kingston — playing with the same instruments and following the same live-to-tape recording techniques that he'd employed in the genre's beginnings. The album included a cover of ""The Guns of Brixton"" by The Clash, which references Ivanhoe Martin in its lyrics.

""One of the reasons for covering that song was to show and remind people the influence that reggae music had on punk music,"" Cliff told NPR. ""Because reggae and punk address the same issues — political, social issues. I think that is the essence of the connection.""",figurative
"The first song I fell in love with

God Will Open Doors by Walter Hawkins. I grew up on the Hawkins gospel family. They were my teachers. I was raised by my grandparents, and my auntie fell in love with the gospel sound and imported records from America – although my grandparents thought it was a bit too secular, even though it was gospel.

The song I inexplicably know every lyric to For some reason, out of all his songs, Adore by Prince always speaks to me.

The first single I bought

Funkin’ for Jamaica (NY) by Tom Browne from Red Records in Brixton, although I was so young I could hardly reach the counter.

The best song to play at a party

Sex Machine by James Brown gets everybody up, and sends everybody nuts. It’s one of those songs that cuts through everyone’s musical taste.

The song I can no longer listen to

It really hurts listening to Greatest Love of All by Whitney Houston, because I knew her so well. It’s funny, I don’t feel that way about Prince’s music. But anything by Whitney just destroys me.

The best song to have sex to

Distant Lover by Marvin Gaye.

The song I do at karaoke

If there’s one song that gets people moving, it’s Gimme Some More by Busta Rhymes. It’s such a wicked tune, and you don’t have to be a great singer. I go for the funky stuff and Busta’s my boy.

The song I secretly like, but tell everybody I hate

I’m always pretending to people I’m a bit too past it to like Shake It Off by Taylor Swift. I’m a grandmother, babe. And a soul singer. They’re like: “What the hell? Whatcha doing here?”

The song that makes me cry

Every time I hear I’m Still Here by Dorinda Clark-Cole from the Clark Sisters – who are like the female Jacksons of the gospel world – I’m in tears. That song always hits me.

The song that changed my life

What’s Going On by Marvin Gaye. My dad played it to me in the car when I was around 12. I just remember looking at him and saying: “I don’t want to do gospel music for much longer, Dad. I want to do this kind of music.”

The song that gets me up in the morning

I always tell my band to practise Yatra-Ta by Tania Maria. I’m very much into my Brazilian jazz and Latino. I love all that stuff, because my grandfather’s Portuguese, so even though I’m Jamaican, I have a big Latino influence. It’s in the blood.

The song I’d like played at my funeral

Heaven, which Gary Barlow wrote for me for my new album. I’d like Gary to sing it at my funeral, please.

"Like other US officials, the Texas governor is eager to weaponise Islamophobia for political gain.

When on November 19 Texas Governor Greg Abbott called for an official investigation into so-called “Sharia courts”, it was not based on evidence, complaints, or any legal irregularity. It was a political performance. There are no Sharia courts in Texas — only voluntary Muslim mediation panels operating under the same framework used by Jewish beth din courts and Christian arbitration services.

Yet in a letter sent to district attorneys and sheriffs demanding an investigation, Abbott wrote that “The Constitution’s religious protections provide no authority for religious courts to skirt state and federal laws simply by donning robes and pronouncing positions inconsistent with western civilization,” implying that Muslims were secretly building an alternative legal system.

This is not law enforcement. It is political theatre designed to stoke fear.

A day earlier, on November 18, Abbott issued an executive order designating the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) — the largest Muslim civil rights organisation in the country — as a “foreign terrorist organisation” (FTO).

The order cited no crimes, no violence, no plot, no prosecutorial record. It was simply a sweeping claim that an American civil rights group constituted a national security threat.

Lawyers immediately noted that Abbott does not have the authority to designate FTOs; only the US federal government does. But again, the point was not legal accuracy.

This ineffectual order was more about political messaging than anything else. It was aimed to portray Muslim Americans and their institutions as suspect and their civic engagement as a security risk.

Advertisement

Abbott’s actions are the latest product of a long-running American panic machine that transforms ordinary Muslim life into a threat narrative. This panic machine has been in operation for decades and has repeatedly weaponised Sharia for political gain.

For example, in the late 2000s, a coordinated national campaign—spearheaded by activists like David Yerushalmi and organisations such as ACT for America—pushed legislators across the country to introduce “anti-Sharia” bills. In the early 2010s, more than 40 states considered laws barring courts from applying “foreign law”, a euphemism universally understood to mean Islamic law.

The most extreme example occurred in the US state of Oklahoma, where voters approved a constitutional amendment explicitly banning Sharia and the application of international law. When the law was challenged in court, a federal judge blocked it.

This and other legal challenges exposed these measures for what they were: political stunts, not responses to real legal problems. Yet the broader campaign succeeded in normalising the idea that Muslim religious practice itself is a national security threat, paving the way for later escalations, including Abbott’s actions in Texas today.

Months before the call to investigate “Sharia courts”, again in Texas, a Muslim-led real estate project was targeted with a Department of Justice (DOJ) investigation and branded online as a “Sharia colony”. Local residents were told that Islamic law would govern the neighbourhood, that non-Muslims would be excluded, and that the development was part of a creeping Islamic takeover. None of the rumours were true: the project was open to everyone and sought only to address the region’s housing crisis.

The DOJ ended its investigation after finding no illegality in June, but in September, Governor Abbott signed a law banning “Sharia compounds” in Texas.

This dynamic has played out far beyond Texas. In the state of Tennessee, opponents of a mosque in Murfreesboro argued that Islam was not a religion and that Muslims were therefore undeserving of First Amendment protection. The argument defied centuries of constitutional doctrine, but that didn’t matter; the point was to make Muslim religious life appear legally illegitimate.

In Dearborn, Michigan, a city with one of the country’s oldest Arab and Muslim communities, viral hoaxes have repeatedly claimed the city has been “taken over by Sharia law”. Fabricated videos, manipulated headlines, and images from other countries have been circulated to create the illusion of Islamic governance on American soil. Fact-checks have debunked these narratives, yet the rumours have persisted.

Advertisement

Muslim public figures have also been targeted. During his campaign, New York City’s Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani faced racist memes and conspiracy theories claiming he was plotting to usher in “Sharia rule” if elected. None of Mamdani’s policy proposals have any religious content whatsoever. His agenda focuses on mass transit, housing, and police accountability. But to those invested in Sharia panic, a Muslim in public office is always presumed to be a Trojan horse.

And it is not just Republicans who have fanned these flames. Major newspapers, liberal politicians, and even civil liberties institutions have repeatedly adopted the underlying framing that Islamic law is inherently foreign, inherently political, or inherently at odds with American values. By accepting the premise that Sharia is a threat, they effectively validate the narrative architecture of Islamophobia even when they claim to oppose it.

These incidents reveal a consistent pattern: the panic surrounding Sharia is not about law, safety, or constitutional principle. It is about boundary maintenance in a country struggling with demographic change. It is about who gets to be seen as American and who remains permanently suspect. The panic keeps reemerging not because it reflects valid concerns, but because it is useful — an instrument for mobilising voters, policing civic belonging, and justifying state surveillance.

What makes this all the more ironic is that Sharia, as understood by Islamic scholars across centuries, bears little resemblance to the caricatures that animate US politics. In Arabic, Sharia means “a path to the water”, a metaphor for moral and spiritual nourishment.

It is a broad ethical framework concerned with justice, welfare, and accountability. Its foundational aims — the maqāṣid al-sharīʿa — revolve around protecting life, intellect, faith, property, and human dignity. The tradition contains sophisticated doctrines of equity (istiḥsān), public interest (maṣlaḥa), and custom (ʿurf), which operate much like the equitable and contextual tools of modern common law systems.

Far from being an alien code, Sharia shares deep structural resonances with Western legal traditions. As Professor John Makdisi demonstrated in a landmark North Carolina Law Review article, several foundational features of English common law bear striking parallels to Islamic legal institutions, likely transmitted through Norman Sicily. This history matters not because it collapses distinctions between legal systems, but because it exposes the absurdity of the idea that Islamic law is inherently incompatible with Western governance.

The United States once understood that legacy. When the Supreme Court chamber was unveiled in 1935, it featured a marble frieze depicting humanity’s greatest lawgivers, including Prophet Muhammad, shown holding a Quran as a symbol of justice and moral authority. Today, acknowledging that simple historical fact would itself trigger outrage.

The renewed Sharia panic is not about Islam entering American courts; it is about Islam entering American civic life. It is about Muslim political participation, Muslim community development, Muslim institutions, and Muslim representation — all recast as existential threats. As the country enters another election cycle animated by anti-diversity rhetoric, anti-Muslim conspiracy theories, and attacks on Middle East studies programmes, Sharia becomes a flexible container for a much older anxiety: the fear of a pluralistic America.

The danger is not Sharia. The danger is the political machinery that turns ordinary Muslim Americans into objects of suspicion, targets of state power, and props in a culture war they did not choose. If there is anything Americans should fear, it is not Islamic law, but the weaponisation of fear.

"The most recent polls place Mamdani 14.3 points ahead of Cuomo, according to a RealClearPolitics poll average.

New York City’s mayoral race is entering its final stretch, with some five million registered voters set to cast their ballots on November 4 to choose the city’s next leader.

According to the New York City Board of Elections, 734,317 early votes have been cast over the past nine days – more than quadruple the total for the 2021 mayoral elections.

According to the latest RealClearPolitics average, Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani leads with 46.1 percent, holding a 14.3-point advantage over independent Andrew Cuomo at 31.8 percent and a 29.8-point lead over Republican Curtis Sliwa at 16.3 percent.

But late on Monday, Cuomo received endorsements from President Donald Trump, a Republican, and from Elon Musk, the world’s richest man. It is unclear if those last-minute endorsements will sway voters.

Mamdani, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), has energised liberal voters drawn to his proposals for universal, free childcare, free buses, and a rent freeze for New Yorkers living in about one million rent-regulated apartments.

New York City holds mayoral elections every four years, with a two-term limit for any individual. The current mayor, Democrat Eric Adams, who has been in office since January 2022, withdrew his candidacy earlier in the year following several controversies, most notably his federal criminal indictment on bribery and conspiracy charges, which was ultimately dismissed by a judge in April.

This year’s contest is notable for its three-way dynamic, bringing progressive, establishment and conservative forces to face off in the country’s largest city.

How accurate are the polls?

The latest polls put Mamdani between three and 25 points ahead of Cuomo, according to a selection of polls from RealClearPolitics.

Every poll carries a degree of uncertainty. While pollsters aim to capture a representative sample and mirror the wider electorate, there are margins of error. As such, actual levels of support fall within a few points of reported figures, with each surveyor using differing wording in issues such as how to treat undecided voters.

Aggregating different results helps to reduce bias.

However, most polls were wildly off about the Democratic Party’s primary for the New York mayoral race earlier in the year, largely predicting a comfortable win for Cuomo over Mamdani. Eventually, Mamdani won by a landslide.

How does polling work?

Polling organisations, such as Emerson College, Marist College and Quinnipiac University, regularly conduct public opinion surveys to gauge voter sentiment leading up to the primaries and general elections.

Surveys use random sampling, including contacting voters by phone, text, or online, and ask respondents about their candidate preferences, key issues influencing their vote and approval ratings.

Poll results include margins of error and sample sizes, which aid in interpreting accuracy and the fidelity of findings.

How the voting works

Unlike the primaries, which used ranked choice voting (RCV), the general election uses a first-past-the-post system, so whoever gets the most votes wins.

As of February, there were 5.1 million registered voters in New York City, of whom 65 percent were Democrats and 11 percent were Republicans. About 1.1 million voters were not registered with any party, and voter registration closed on October 25, one week before the November 4 election.

In the last New York City mayoral election, just more than 1.1 million voters cast ballots – about 21 percent of registered voters.

To be eligible to vote, residents of New York must:

Be a citizen of the United States

Have been a New York City resident for at least 30 days

Be at least 18 years old (you may preregister at 16 or 17, but can’t vote until you’re 18)

Not be in prison for a felony conviction

Not have been judged mentally incompetent by a court

Not be registered to vote elsewhere

When do polls open and close?

Polling stations will be open between 6am (11:00 GMT) and 9pm on November 4 (02:00 GMT on November 5).

Timings vary from location to location in the city, but polling stations open between 8am and 10am and close between 4pm and 9pm.

Early voting began on October 25 and ended on November 2.

A full list of polling stations open for early voting is available on the website of the New York City Board of Elections.",figurative
"I’ve been reporting about sneakers for over five years, and during almost every conversation I have with podiatrists, shoe buyers and athletes, Hoka comes up. The brand only launched about 15 years ago, but it’s quickly become a household name. It offers highly cushioned shoes that can support your feet whether you’re running a marathon or standing all day, but what about while walking?

To answer that question, I coordinated three months of testing among the NBC Select staff, who wore different Hoka sneakers and reported their findings. Here’s everything we learned about the best Hoka walking shoes.

Want more from NBC Select? Sign up for our newsletter, The Selection, and shop smarter.

Methodology

Before our testing period, I interviewed two experts — Dr. Anne Sharkey, a podiatrist at the North Austin Foot and Ankle Institute, and Jewels Busenberg, a senior buyer at Zappos — about what makes Hoka’s shoes distinct, factors to pay attention to while wearing them and which models are typically the best for walking. (Ed’s note: The inclusion of products sold by Zappos in this article was made independently of Busenberg.) With their guidance, I put together a list of five Hoka shoes for eight NBC Select staff members to test.

Hoka gifted our team courtesy samples, and two staff members tested each sneaker. Where possible, one person tested a women’s size and one person tested a men’s size for each shoe. We tested each Hoka sneaker for three months. We wore them indoors on treadmills and outdoors on pavement and trails for varying amounts of time.

How we tested Hoka walking shoes

While testing Hoka walking shoes, we considered the following factors:

Activity: We wore each sneaker while walking varying distances and for varying periods. We wore them for exercise and leisure, including commuting around New York City.

Arch support : There are two main categories that shoes fall into: cushioning shoes and stability shoes. Cushioning shoes are best for people with high arches because their feet need help absorbing shock, says Sharkey. On the other hand, stability shoes are ideal for people with flat feet because they’re designed with features that help prevent overpronation, she says. Some shoes fall between cushioning and stability — they’re typically best for those with neutral arches. We evaluated how well our sneakers aligned with our arch type and evaluated overall support.

Fit: We wore Hoka walking shoes in our typical sneaker sizes. During the testing period, we noted whether our shoes felt big, small or true to size. We also evaluated fit by making sure there was a thumbs width of space between the front of our shoe and our longest toe to account for potential swelling, especially at night, per Sharkey’s recommendation. We also noted whether any part of the shoes rubbed against our feet, and whether our heels slipped at all while walking, which should not happen with a properly fitted sneaker, says Busenberg.

The best Hoka walking shoes

All the Hoka walking shoes we tested and recommend below are available in men’s and women’s sizes, as well as standard and wide widths. Some earned the American Podiatric Medical Association’s Seal of Acceptance — I noted which ones.

Among other features, the Hoka’s website specifies each shoe’s stability and cushioning level, which I included below. Hoka breaks stability level into three categories, from least to most stabilizing: neutral, moderate and stable. It also breaks cushioning level into three categories, from the least/firmest to the most/softest: responsive, balanced and plush. I also listed each shoe’s heel drop, which is the difference in height between the heel and toe, and heel stack height, which is the amount of material between your heel and the ground. Heel stack height tends to be the thickest part of the shoe.

Best max cushioning

The Bondi 9 is one of the most easy-to-identify Hoka sneakers due to its thick cushioning in the midsole, the brand’s signature feature. There’s also extra foam in the heel area, giving it a billowed shape that acts as a crash pad every time you take a step. It absorbs the majority of shock when your foot meets the ground so you don’t feel it elsewhere, which is ideal for those who have high arches. With all this foam, however, comes extra weight. “They’re somewhere in between light and heavy,” says Jordan Bowman, NBC Select commerce editor, who wore the sneakers to walk his dog multiple times daily. “But overall, they didn’t weigh me down at all.”

Since the Bondi 9s are so highly cushioned, they lift you off the ground by a few inches, which, at times, made Bowman tip his body forward. He also wasn’t always able to feel the road beneath him. That’s typically par for the course with a true max cushioning shoe, so if you’re interested in this one from Hoka, be prepared. “These shoes feel like a cloud, and I found them to be incredibly comfortable,” says Bowman. “They supported my feet, ankles and neutral arches well, too.”

Despite their thick cushioning layer, Bowan says these sneakers don’t weigh him down while walking. Courtesy Jordan Bowman

Best for long distances

The Hoka Gaviota 5 is a stability shoe designed with the brand’s H-frame, an H-shaped piece of foam that goes all the way around the sneaker and crosses through the center. The H-frame helps reduce overpronation, meaning the ankle tilting too far inward, while holistically stabilizing the entire foot, so it’s best for those with flat and neutral arches, according to the brand.

Lindsay Schneider, NBC Select commerce editor, prominently felt the foam around the edges of the shoe, which was sometimes uncomfortable for her ankles since she has higher arches. Still, she says the Gaviota 5s are objectively comfortable. “They’re really cushioned — you don’t feel every nook and cranny on the ground underneath you as you walk,” says Schneider. Bianca Alvarez, former NBC Select associate reporter, who has neutral arches, found the foam evenly distributed and supportive. “I wore these sneakers while walking around New York City and logged 18,634 steps in one day,” she says. “My feet weren’t aching at all and I never felt unstable.” Alvarez also says that while the Gaviota 5s aren’t super lightweight, they’re not heavy to the point where moving feels like a chore.

Best for everyday wear

These sneakers are the most un-Hoka-like Hokas Rebecca Rodriguez, NBC Select editorial projects manager, and I have ever worn. They’re not highly cushioned, don’t give you much of a lift and lack the cushy feel most people expect from the brand — and that’s exactly why we love them. “They feel like a firm mattress that’s supportive in all the right places,” says Rodriguez. “They’re very comfortable and never hurt my feet, especially after a long day of walking around in them.” The Transports’ toe box is also on the wider side and never bothered Rodriguez’s bunion.

The Hoka Transports are a lifestyle shoe, meaning they’re designed for everyday wear rather than exercise. I throw them on to walk around New York City leisurely or run errands. One of my favorite features is the sneakers’ elastic laces. Instead of tying them, you pull a toggle to tighten or loosen the shoe. However, the shoes come with standard laces, so you can swap out the elastic ones if you don’t like them. The Transports also have a 3D grip pattern that adds traction, which I found helpful while walking on trails.

Best overall

If you’re looking for a Goldilocks walking shoe — meaning one that has just the right amount of everything — this is it. The Clifton 10 is a no-frills sneaker that reliably supports my neutral arches whether I'm exercising or commuting. Its overall construction is near-identical to its predecessor, the Clifton 9, which I've also tested. But the new model has a thicker, softer and more stable layer of plush cushioning, giving it a smoother feel on surfaces like trails and pavement.

I typically walk about five miles in these shoes each time I wear them. In addition to a gentle rocker outsole that keeps me moving forward at whatever pace I set, they have great traction and controlled bounce. The foam also sufficiently cushions my feet so they never feel tired, but it’s not so soft that I’m sinking into it. The sneakers have a roomy toe box and fit true-to-size, in my experience.

Best stability shoe

From the moment NBC Select SEO editor Nikki Brown put the Hoka Arahis on, she found them comfortable. That's partially because these sneakers, like the Gaviotas, have an H-frame to keep the feet and ankles steady with each step. “I have very, very flat feet that curve inward, and I love the high level of arch support in this sneaker,” says Brown. “They have a decent amount of stability and I felt grounded in them.” She wore her Arahis while on long walks, commuting to work and running errands, noting that they didn’t require a break-in period. I agree — I walked over 25,000 steps the first time I wore these shoes and they never made my feet sore or felt like I needed to stretch them out.

Mili Godio, NBC Select updates editor, tested the Arahis, too, walking outdoors and indoors on the treadmill. She didn’t find them as comfortable as Brown and I because she has a higher arch, but she still appreciated their firm, supportive cushioning. “They’re very light without feeling flimsy,” says Godio. “I found myself seamlessly springing forward while walking.”

What’s so great about Hoka sneakers?

Since its inception, one factor has made Hoka’s sneakers distinct: a thick cushioned midsole. “Hoka created the max cushion trend,” says Busenberg. The brand’s shoes are designed with lightweight, highly responsive foam, meaning it compresses to soften landings and absorb shock, then bounces back to spring you forward whether you’re walking, running or standing for long periods of time, says Sharkey. And while the overall feel of the foam — be it firm, plush or somewhere in the middle— varies by shoe, the thick midsole is typically a guarantee.

Despite highly cushioned sneakers being trendy, some shoppers are on the fence. “There’s a view among some that the thicker the shoe, the more geriatric-looking it is,” says Sharkey. “Some people just find them clunky.” But once someone tries on a pair of Hokas and experiences their responsiveness, it can change their perspective. “People put on Hoka’s sneakers and they feel really good,” says Sharkey. “They stop caring what the shoes look like and grow willing to wear them due to the feel.”

Compared to brands like Brooks, Nike and New Balance, which have been around since 1914, 1964 and 1906, respectively, Hoka is a newer brand. It was founded in 2009, so it’s only about 15 years old. But in that short period, it’s become popular because it's attractive to so many communities. “Hoka is able to tap into all markets, from healthcare workers that are on their feet all day, to trendy celebrities, to elite long distance runners,” says Busenberg. The brand has even prompted its competitors to release their own shoes with thick cushioned midsoles, like Brooks with its Ghost Max and Glycerin Max sneakers, Saucony with its Hurricane 24 sneakers and Asics with its Gel-Nimbus 26, says Sharkey.

Two other factors make Hoka’s sneakers stand out: its MetaRocker technology and Active Foot Frame.

The MetaRocker is a curved outsole that rolls you forward to some degree and supports smooth, efficient heel-to-toe transitions, says Busenberg. “The brand increases and decreases the amount of MetaRocker in each shoe depending on the goal,” she says. “The faster the transition, the more “rocker” the shoe will have. On the contrary, if the shoe is meant to provide more stability and ground coverage, it will have a less curved MetaRocker.”

The Active Foot Frame hugs the perimeter of your foot to stabilize it. The frame in a more stabilizing shoe has higher walls, while the frame in a less stabilizing shoe has lower walls, according to the brand.

What’s the difference between Hoka walking shoes and running shoes?

On its website, Hoka labels what activity each shoe is best for, like an everyday run, a walk, a trail run or “lifestyle,” meaning casual wear. Some shoes are labeled best for walking and running — so can you walk in running shoes, and vice versa? “I would never tell someone to run in walking shoes, but you can walk in most running shoes, which means there’s more options available,” says Sharkey. “It’s important to run in running shoes, but there’s some flexibility when it comes to walking,” says Sharkey.

With that said, what are the main differences between walking and running shoes? Here’s what experts told me:

Running shoes usually have a higher heel and a lower toe, which creates a pronounced rocker-shaped outsole and leads to a more energy-efficient stride, propelling you forward faster, says Sharkey. There’s also prominent cushioning in the heel and midfoot area. Most runners are heel strikers, meaning their heel hits the ground first, then their weight transitions to the forefoot, pushing them forward. Added cushioning helps with shock absorption, says Busenberg.

The toe box is also a bit bigger, which allows the toes to spread out more, and there’s often even cushioning throughout the shoe, says Sharkey.

"Melissa has strengthened into a major Category 5 storm. Here’s what that means.

Hurricane Melissa, which has been barrelling towards Jamaica, is expected to be the most powerful hurricane to ever make a direct hit on the island.

The hurricane intensified on Monday into a Category 5 storm, the most powerful on the Saffir-Simpson scale, with wind speeds exceeding 300km/h (186mph).

By Monday night, Melissa had begun lashing Jamaica. Seven deaths have been reported so far – three in Jamaica, three in Haiti and one in the Dominican Republic.

The storm was expected to make landfall in Jamaica on Tuesday morning, according to the National Hurricane Center (NHC) in the United States. It said Melissa would cause “destructive winds” and “catastrophic flooding”, which it forecast would worsen throughout the day and night.

Jamaica’s Meteorological Service added: “Life-threatening storm surge, accompanied by large and destructive waves, is likely along the south coast of Jamaica late Monday through Tuesday morning.”

How did Hurricane Melissa form?

Melissa originated as a cluster of thunderstorms off the coast of West Africa. It travelled west and evolved into a depression. On October 21, it reached tropical storm status.

Over the weekend, Melissa became a Category 4 storm as it made its way west through the Caribbean Sea.

Melissa is the 13th hurricane of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to November 30. On average, the Atlantic basin experiences about seven hurricanes and three major hurricanes each year. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the US predicted an above-normal Atlantic hurricane season this year with 13 to 18 named storms.

This is the third Category 5 hurricane of the season after Hurricanes Erin and Humberto.

Authorities use the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale to classify storms. The scale divides hurricanes into five categories based on their sustained wind speeds.

The highest is Category 5, which means a storm that has a sustained wind speed of 252km/h (157mph) or higher. Category 5 storms usually bring “catastrophic damage”, according to the NHC.

How has Melissa progressed? When and where will it hit Jamaica?

In anticipation of the hurricane, residents in Jamaica have been told to protect their homes with sandbags and boards, and to stock up on essentials.

The NHC said hurricane-force winds will extend up to 45km (30 miles) from Melissa’s centre and tropical storm-force winds will extend up to 315km (195 miles) from it.

By 4am local time (09:00 GMT) on Tuesday, Hurricane Melissa was still “slowly” moving towards Jamaica with anticipated landfall later in the morning.

On Tuesday morning, Melissa’s centre was located about 180km (115 miles) southwest of the island, the hurricane was edging closer to Jamaica at a speed of about 8 kilometres per hour (5 miles per hour) as it made a northeast turn.

The turn – which is expected to bring the hurricane’s eyewall first to Jamaica’s southern coast – will be accompanied by “an increase in forward speed”, the NHC said, “followed by a faster northeastward motion” on Wednesday and Thursday.

Melissa is projected to be Jamaica’s worst storm in the century, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) warned on Tuesday.

“It’s a catastrophic situation expected in Jamaica,” Anne-Claire Fontan, a tropical cyclone specialist at the WMO said during a press briefing in Geneva. “For Jamaica, it will be the storm of the century for sure.”

Here is how the storm is expected to progress:

Monday, 7am in Jamaica (12:00 GMT)

On Monday morning, Melissa was upgraded to a Category 5 hurricane as it moved northwest in the Caribbean.

Tuesday, 1am (06:00 GMT)

Melissa will likely make landfall soon after this time. The NHC said because the storm is moving slowly – at 8km/h (5mph) – it will cause more damage.

“This extreme rainfall potential, owing to the slow motion, is going to create a catastrophic event here for Jamaica,” NHC Deputy Director Jamie Rhome said.

Melissa is expected to bring rainfall of 381mm to 762mm (15 to 30 inches) to portions of Jamaica and additional rainfall of 203mm to 406mm (8 to 16 inches) for southern Hispaniola through Wednesday with rainfall totals of 1,016mm (40 inches) possible. Catastrophic flash flooding and numerous landslides are likely.

Wednesday, 1pm (18:00 GMT)

Melissa is forecast to pass over Cuba by Wednesday before moving through the Greater Antilles and out into the Atlantic.

It is predicted to weaken to Category 3 by the time it reaches Cuba.

What is the latest on the ground?

Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness said: “I know that there are many Jamaicans who are anxious, who are very concerned, and rightfully so. You should be concerned.

“But the best way to address anxiety and any nervousness and concern is to be prepared.”

He added that “there is no infrastructure in the region” that can withstand a storm of Melissa’s strength.

Jamaica’s Meteorological Service has advised small craft operators and fishermen on the cays and banks to remain in safe harbour until wind and sea conditions return to normal

“Leaving the island before the hurricane arrives is not an option,” it said. The main airports – Kingston and Montego Bay – are closed. Kingston’s airport is warning: “Passengers, contact your airline for rebooking. DO NOT go to the airport.”

Warnings have also been put in place for parts of Haiti, the Dominican Republic and eastern Cuba, where Melissa is expected to cause similar damage.

Jamaica’s history of hurricanes

According to the NHC, Jamaica has experienced only one Category 4 storm, Hurricane Gilbert in 1988. It was the most destructive storm in Jamaica’s history and killed at least 45 people.

In October 2012, Hurricane Sandy was the first to make landfall on the island since Gilbert. It hit as a Category 1 storm.

In 2024, Hurricane Beryl, a Category 5 storm, brushed the southern coast of Jamaica and caused heavy winds and rain and damaged buildings. It also caused the deaths of four people.",literal
"The Defense Department said Monday that it is opening an investigation into Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, a retired Navy captain, in connection with a video he and other Democrats recorded urging members of the military and the intelligence community not to comply with illegal orders from President Donald Trump’s administration.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said on X that the video, which set off a political firestorm last week, was ""despicable, reckless, and false.""

""Five of the six individuals in that video do not fall under @DeptofWar jurisdiction (one is CIA and four are former military but not ‘retired’, so they are no longer subject to UCMJ). However, Mark Kelly (retired Navy Commander) is still subject to UCMJ—and he knows that,"" he added, referring to the Uniform Code of Military Justice.

A thorough review of allegations has been initiated to determine further actions, which could include recalling Kelly to active duty for court-martial proceedings or administrative measures, the Defense Department said.

Kelly, who spent more than two decades in the Navy as a pilot and retired as a captain, said on X that Hegseth's post was the first he had heard of the investigation.

""If this is meant to intimidate me and other members of Congress from doing our jobs and holding this administration accountable, it won’t work,"" he said. ""I’ve given too much to this country to be silenced by bullies who care more about their own power than protecting the Constitution.""

Kelly’s fellow Arizona senator, Ruben Gallego, wrote on X that Kelly ""has dedicated his life to serving this country with honor. And now Trump is coming after him with the same baseless garbage he throws at anyone who refuses to bend the knee. Mark told the truth — in America, we swear an oath to the Constitution, not wannabe kings.""

""F--- you and your investigation,"" added Gallego, a Democrat and veteran of the Marines.

Trump said last week on Truth Social that the Democratic lawmakers “should be arrested and put on trial,” accusing them of “seditious behavior” that, he said, could be “punishable by death.”

The next day, he said on conservative Brian Kilmeade's radio show that he was ""not threatening death"" toward the members.

“I think they’re in serious trouble. I would say they’re in serious trouble. I’m not threatening death, but I think they’re in serious trouble,"" Trump said. ""In the old days, it was death. That was seditious behavior.""

The Democrats' video was posted online Tuesday as a direct appeal to members of the military and the intelligence community.

“This administration is pitting our uniformed military and intelligence community professionals against American citizens,"" the lawmakers said in the video. ""Like us, you all swore an oath to protect and defend this Constitution. Right now, the threats coming to our Constitution aren’t just coming from abroad but from right here at home. Our laws are clear. You can refuse illegal orders. You must refuse illegal orders. No one has to carry out orders that violate the law or our Constitution.”

In addition to Kelly, it featured Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan and Reps. Chris Deluzio of Pennsylvania, Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire, Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania and Jason Crow of Colorado. All are military veterans and former intelligence officials.

Kelly is the only lawmaker in the group who retired from the military. That means he can be recalled for an urgent need like a war or a national emergency but also to face court-martial for misconduct.

As part of the Pentagon's investigation, if the facts support charges, Kelly’s commander would notify him of them. It’s not clear yet who Kelly’s commander would be. Kelly would then sign a charge sheet and be recalled to active duty to possibly face a court-martial. The Convening Authority, which is similar to a judge, could then refer the case to court-martial — the equivalent of an indictment in a civilian court.

The likeliest charges that would be pursued are basically a catch-all: Article 133 Conduct Unbecoming an Officer and Article 134 Conduct Prejudicial to Good Order and Discipline. If he were found guilty, Kelly could be knocked down to a rank lower than captain, his separation could be changed to dishonorable, he could lose his benefits, and he could serve jail time.

In social media posts Monday, Crow and Slotkin voiced their support for Kelly and bashed Trump.

“You can’t bully a patriot. I stand with @SenMarkKelly,” Crow wrote. “This is a decisive moment. Trump is trying to incite violence, intimidate, and punish those who speak up to hold him accountable.”

In her post, Slotkin wrote: “This is the President’s playbook: using intimidation, harassment, and the weight of the federal government to try and silence anyone who speaks up against him. That won’t stop Senator Kelly, or any of us, from standing up for what’s right.”

Slotkin has previously defended the group's original video, noting that the Uniform Code of Military Justice requires members of the military to disobey illegal orders.

""This is the law,"" she said last week in response to a post from White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller criticizing the Democrats. ""Passed down from our Founding Fathers, to ensure our military upholds its oath to the Constitution — not a king. Given you’re directing much of a military policy, you should buff up"" on the UCMJ.

Multiple lawmakers in the video have said they have faced threats following Trump's threats.

""I’ve been through dangerous situations before, so it doesn’t change my feeling about speaking my mind,"" Slotkin said Sunday in an interview ABC’s ""This Week."" ""But obviously, the president took issue with one sentence in a video and was calling for our death. I think that’s inappropriate, whether you’re a Democrat, Republican or an independent.""",figurative
"Israel kills top Hezbollah commander only two days after Lebanon’s president said he was open to negotiations.

Israel has killed a senior Hezbollah commander in an attack on Beirut’s southern suburbs, which comes only two days after Lebanon’s president announced the country had succumbed to an Israeli pressure campaign and agreed to hold negotiations.

Hezbollah confirmed that its chief of staff, Haytham Ali Tabtabai, was among five people killed and 28 others wounded in the Israeli strike on Beirut’s Haret Hreik neighbourhood on Sunday.

Israeli officials and media have warned of a renewed escalation against Lebanon in recent weeks, claiming Hezbollah is regrouping and rearming. Meanwhile, Lebanon’s government has come under pressure from Israel via its main benefactor, the United States, as both countries urge it to move faster to disarm Hezbollah and meet with Israelis for direct talks.

Israel has ‘the upper hand’

Lebanon’s leadership had pushed for indirect negotiations with Israel, even though the issue is divisive inside the country. Just two days before Israel’s attack on Beirut’s suburb, Lebanon’s President Joseph Aoun addressed the issue.

“The Lebanese state is ready to negotiate under the UN, US or joint international sponsorship – any agreement that would establish a framework for a permanent end to transborder aggressions,” Aoun announced on Friday from Tyr, a southern city that suffered extensive damage during last year’s war.

Aoun did not say explicitly whether or not the talks would be direct. Analysts, however, told Al Jazeera that Israel’s recent uptick in attacks indicates it is not looking to negotiate.

Israel “has got the upper hand militarily at the moment, and they don’t seem to be interested in negotiating in earnest,” Nicholas Blanford, a nonresident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council, told Al Jazeera.

“They’re quite happy sniping away at Hezbollah on a daily basis … Lebanon is doing what they can under the circumstances, but I don’t think they have a willing interlocutor in the Israelis at this stage.”

Despite an ostensible ceasefire, Israel has intensified attacks in Lebanon’s south and Bekaa Valley in recent days. At least 13 people were killed by an Israeli strike on Lebanon’s largest Palestinian refugee camp last week, in an attack that killed mostly children and marked the highest death toll in a single strike since a ceasefire was agreed in November last year.

Israel has killed more than 300 people in Lebanon since then, including around 127 civilians, according to the United Nations. It also continues to occupy at least five points in south Lebanon, despite the ceasefire stating Israel would withdraw its troops from Lebanese territory.

“The problem is that Israel is not interested in negotiating at the moment. It wants to eliminate Hezbollah or push the Lebanese army into a clash with the party,” Kassem Kassir, a Lebanese journalist close to Hezbollah, told Al Jazeera.

“Every time Aoun or [Prime Minister Nawaf] Salam talk about negotiations, Israel escalates its aggression.”

Israel ‘should demonstrate good faith’

Tabtabai’s killing marks the highest-ranking Hezbollah target killed since the ceasefire. The attack also came a week to the day before Pope Leo XIV’s planned visit to the country and a day after Lebanon mutedly celebrated its 82nd independence day.

US and Israeli officials have warned Lebanon of an intensification should the country not move faster to disarm Hezbollah. In August, Lebanon’s cabinet approved a plan to have the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) disarm Hezbollah and bring the group’s weapons under the state’s control. Hezbollah has refused to relinquish its weapons, saying the move serves Israel.

Still, the Lebanese army has been criticised by some US officials for moving too slowly in disarming Hezbollah. Analysts say the Lebanese government has also been criticised for failing to establish a political consensus on the divisive issue.

But Israel’s actions are undermining the Lebanese government’s efforts, according to analysts. After Lebanon’s cabinet approved the plan to disarm Hezbollah, US Special Envoy Tom Barrack visited Israel in an effort to get its military to stop attacks and withdraw troops from the Lebanese territory. He came back empty-handed.

The US recently cancelled a planned trip by Lebanon’s army chief Rodolphe Haykal to Washington, DC after the LAF issued a statement critical of Israel. Haykal had previously proposed suspending LAF operations on disarming Hezbollah until Israel stops its attacks.

“If Israel actively wants to enter and succeed in negotiations, it should demonstrate good faith in entering, and ways for that would be to at least reduce attacks on Lebanese territory or withdraw from some points in the south. They could create a positive dynamic to develop a consensus,” David Wood, the International Crisis Group’s senior analyst for Lebanon, told Al Jazeera.

Choices before Hezbollah

Since last November’s ceasefire, Hezbollah has only responded to Israeli attacks once. Under its new Secretary-General Naim Qassem, the group has largely shown restraint.

Still, there are concerns in Lebanon that the group may decide to soon change tactics.

“There is definitely a mood to strike back against the Israelis, not just from today’s attack but in general,” Blanford said. “But they know very well that if they do, the Israelis will escalate, and no one in Lebanon will thank Hezbollah for doing that.”

Israel’s military superiority and its US backing leave Hezbollah and the Lebanese state with few choices. Currently in Lebanon, the issue of negotiations with Israel and Hezbollah’s disarmament is divisive.

Analysts said many in the country fervently oppose direct negotiations, though the government has expressed a willingness to enter indirect talks, similar to 2022’s maritime agreement between Israel and Lebanon.

Many in Lebanon, including Hezbollah’s supporters, say they would be open to seeing Israel withdraw its troops from southern Lebanon and demarcate the border. Few welcome a renewed aggression, suggesting diplomacy as a likely preference.

But analysts say that would require Israel to respect the agreements it enters into, including the various ceasefire deals it has repeatedly violated.

“What we’ve seen since the ceasefire is that Israel speaks more loudly with actions than words,” Wood said. “Opponents [of negotiations] can point to Israel’s behaviour in Lebanon, Syria and Gaza, and say Israel is not bound by its own agreements.”",literal
"Jimmy Cliff, the singer and actor whose mellifluous voice helped to turn reggae into a global phenomenon, has died aged 81.

A message from his wife Latifa Chambers on Instagram reads: “It’s with profound sadness that I share that my husband, Jimmy Cliff, has crossed over due to a seizure followed by pneumonia. I am thankful for his family, friends, fellow artists and coworkers who have shared his journey with him. To all his fans around the world, please know that your support was his strength throughout his whole career … Jimmy, my darling, may you rest in peace. I will follow your wishes.” Her message was also signed by their children, Lilty and Aken.

With hits including You Can Get It If You Really Want, I Can See Clearly Now and Wonderful World, Beautiful People, Cliff’s upbeat musical temperament brought him a large and longstanding fanbase. His lead acting role in 1972 crime drama The Harder They Come was also acclaimed, with the film seen as a cornerstone of Jamaican cinema.

He is one of just a handful of musicians, alongside Bob Marley and others, to be awarded the Jamaican Order of Merit.

Jamaican prime minister Andrew Holness was among those paying tribute to Cliff, calling him “a true cultural giant whose music carried the heart of our nation to the world … Jimmy Cliff told our story with honesty and soul. His music lifted people through hard times, inspired generations, and helped to shape the global respect that Jamaican culture enjoys today.”

Cliff was born in Saint James, Jamaica in 1944, and his music career began in the early 1960s after he moved to the island’s capital Kingston and began collaborating with producer Leslie Kong. Kong’s family owned a record shop called Beverley’s and Cliff wrote a song namechecking it to help persuade Kong – who would go on to become key producer in reggae – to work with him.

He had a number of local hits and was selected as a Jamaican representative at the World’s Fair expo in New York in 1964, but his career really took off later that decade after he signed to Island Records.

He was initially marketed to a rock crowd – hence curios such as his cover of Whiter Shade of Pale – and found life in his new home of London alienating, later describing the city as “a bitch … I experienced racism in a manner I had never experienced before”. But the sparkling ska of 1969’s Wonderful World, Beautiful People proved to be his breakthrough UK hit, reaching No 6 in the charts.

Its message of hope and unity carried with it a rebuke of the current state of the world (“cheating, backbiting, scandalising and hating”) and that blend of beautiful music and socially conscious lyrics became a core part of Cliff’s artistry. After writing Vietnam, a song pleading for the end to that war, Cliff later recalled: “The critics in London said, ‘Wow! How is he singing this kind of serious song and such a happy rhythm?’ And I said: Wow! I didn’t even realise I was doing that. I was just writing a song to a rhythm.”

Cliff was back in the UK Top 10 in 1970 with a cover of Cat Stevens’s Wild World, before filming The Harder They Come in 1972, after the film’s director Perry Henzell intuited that he would make a good actor.

Its soundtrack album, with Cliff performances such as the title track and You Can Get It If You Really Want alongside others by Desmond Dekker, Toots & the Maytals and more, helped to bring reggae to a wider audience, especially in the US where the film was eventually released in 1973.

The film’s gangster milieu was familiar to Cliff, as he recalled in the Observer in 2022: “When I came to Kingston I lived in areas that were gangster-infested, and to be quite honest, the only thing that stopped me from joining those gangs full-time was I didn’t know where I would bury my head if my family heard that I was in Kingston firing a gun.”

Cliff continued to tour and release albums in the 1970s, and had high-profile appearances in the US such as a booking on Saturday Night Live. He took some time away from music in the mid-late 1970s, travelling to Africa to reconnect with his ancestral roots, and converting to Islam: the 1978 album Give Thankx was partly inspired by those travels.

Bruce Springsteen championed his song Trapped by playing it on tour in the early 1980s, and a live version appeared on the massive-selling charity album We Are the World.

In 1994, he had a huge flush of new fame with his version of I Can See Clearly Now, which appeared on the soundtrack to the Jamaican bobsled drama film Cool Runnings: it returned him to the UK Top 40 for the first time since 1970, topped the French charts and was a hit elsewhere.

Cliff collaborated with numerous other artists over the years from the Rolling Stones to Sting. More recently he worked with the lead singer of punk band Rancid, Tim Armstrong, on an EP and album, the latter winning a Grammy for best reggae album – one of two wins from seven nominations over the years.

Cliff’s most recent album is 2022’s Refugees, made with Wyclef Jean, capping a discography of more than 30 studio albums.

Despite the success of The Harder They Come, Cliff only occasionally returned to acting, most prominently with 1986’s Club Paradise, opposite Robin Williams, Rick Moranis and more.",figurative

"It would have been my late mother’s birthday last Monday, and because I am either astronomically stupid or fathomlessly wise, I elected to spend it at a public meeting about nuclear disarmament. I’d call it a blast from the past, except I feel superstitious about introducing explode-y words too near the nuclear topic.

I spent my entire childhood worrying about nuclear war, partly because it was the 80s, and everyone did, and partly because we spent our lives demonstrating against it. We had “Protest and Survive” stickers everywhere, in droll parody of the public information booklet “Protect and Survive”, along with “Nuclear Power? No Thanks”. We were also early adopters of climate change anxiety, while fiercely against the closure of coalmines. If you’re wondering where we expected to get our power from, well, obviously we didn’t need central heating: the combination of political fervour and long johns was very warming. When I say we, of course I mean “my mother”; my sister and I had very little agency in this quest for peace.

We did go to Greenham Common, site of the women’s peace camp, but never stayed over, and that’s not the bit that stayed in my mind. I remember endless marches through central London, ending with some speakers – they all seemed to be vicars, except one, who was always Tony Benn. They would describe in exquisite detail all the things a hydrogen bomb would do to your flesh, and the flesh of your loved ones and pets, and then what would happen to the teeth and gums of anyone whose flesh had mysteriously been spared. It strikes me now as a bit medieval – godly men getting excited about mortification. But back then all I thought was: I am bored and terrified at the same time, how is that possible?

The anti-nuclear argument has moved on, changed beyond all recognition, although the personnel hasn’t. Prof Mary Kaldor was a giant in the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND), then its Europe-wide arm, END. She spoke last week, having authored a report which says that the nuclear deterrence paradigm is basically bust. It was an answer to yesterday’s problems – and actually, the cold war began three-quarters of a century ago, so it’s very much the day before yesterday – and today’s threats are different. Our enemies will come at us with hybrid warfare, designed to destroy democracy from within by sowing chaos, disorder and polarisation. Russia could use a drone or a bot farm or a misinformation campaign or £30,000 in the pocket of the now former leader of the Reform party in Wales, but in none of those scenarios would threatening to annihilate a quarter of a million of their civilians be very helpful.

It would be better – and cheaper – Kaldor suggested at the meeting, to build democratic resilience from within. Someone else said later that land armies hate nuclear weapons, because they scorch the territory, make it un-takeable; and the only people who liked nukes were the navy. Then an ex-Marine said: “Are you kidding? The navy hates them too, because they’re so expensive, and there’s no money left for the fun stuff.” I guess he meant boats? Anyway, it was fascinating, but it was also bittersweet, as I could imagine my mum hopping up and down, saying: “But … tell them about the incinerated flesh! This is nothing like scary enough!”

Then the nuclear physicist Patricia Lewis made the elegant argument that no population, given the choice, would ever use a nuclear weapon, and all autocracies knew that: the only way these weapons could work as a real threat is if democracies stopped listening to their people, which is to say, became less democratic. So the real thing nuclear weapons deter is democracy itself. My mother would have loved that, though she definitely would have stood up at the end, saying: “This is more of a statement than a question: why, oh why is nobody talking about radiation sickness?”

Anyway, I marked her birthday equal parts missing her and freshly committed to opposing nuclear obliteration – which is pretty much what she would have wanted.

"The court found that lawyer Lindsey Halligan had been illegally appointed to her role as acting US attorney under President Donald Trump.

A United States federal judge has thrown out the criminal charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James and James Comey, the former head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).

On Monday, District Judge Cameron McGowan Currie determined that the prosecutor overseeing the two cases, Lindsey Halligan, had been illegally appointed, which in turn rendered the indictments void.

“All actions flowing from Ms Halligan’s defective appointment”, including the indictments against Comey and James, were unlawful exercises of executive power and are hereby set aside”, Currie said.

The decision is a major setback for the administration of President Donald Trump, who personally petitioned for criminal charges against James and Comey.

On his social media platform, Comey praised the decision from the court.

“I’m grateful that the court ended the case against me, which was a prosecution based on malevolence and incompetence and a reflection of what the Department of Justice has become under Donald Trump,” he said in a video uploaded on Instagram.

He continued to say that a message must be sent that the president “cannot use the Department of Justice to target his political enemies”.

In a statement to US media, James said she was “heartened by today’s victory”.

“I remain fearless in the face of these baseless charges as I continue fighting for New Yorkers every single day”.

But the legal worries for James and Comey, both prominent Trump critics, may not be over yet.

In dismissing the criminal charges, Currie rendered her verdict without prejudice, meaning that both cases could be refiled.

She did, however, rule that Halligan “had no legal authority” to bring the indictments, leaving questions about the future of her role as prosecutor.

In the aftermath of the ruling, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt denounced Currie as a “partisan judge” and emphasised that the administration would fight the decision.

“I know there was a judge who is clearly trying to shield Letitia James and James Comey from receiving accountability, and that’s why they took this unprecedented action to throw away the indictments against these two individuals,” Leavitt said.

“But the Department of Justice will be appealing very soon. And it is our position that Lindsey Halligan is extremely qualified for this position – but more importantly, was legally appointed to it.”

Al Jazeera’s Alan Fisher, reporting from Washington, DC, also said that an appeal by the Justice Department was “almost certain”.

“But for the moment, this is a victory for James Comey and also a victory for Letitia James, and a defeat for Donald Trump and his Department of Justice”.

A controversial choice as prosecutor

Halligan had been appointed in September to serve as interim US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia.

Trump had a public falling-out with Halligan’s predecessor, Erik Siebert, who reportedly refused to file charges against James due to a lack of evidence.

That triggered outrage in the White House. Siebert announced his resignation on September 19, and the following day, Trump took to social media to declare that he had fired the prosecutor himself.

“He even lied to the media and said he quit, and that we had no case,” Trump wrote. “No, I fired him, and there is a GREAT CASE, and many lawyers, and legal pundits, say so.”

The president also addressed Attorney General Pam Bondi in the message, saying that the Department of Justice needed to move forward with charges against James, Comey and a US senator, Adam Schiff of California.

“What about Comey, Adam ‘Shifty’ Schiff, Leticia??? They’re all guilty as hell, but nothing is going to be done,” Trump wrote.

He urged Bondi to act immediately to secure indictments, signalling that Halligan would help.

“We can’t delay any longer, it’s killing our reputation and credibility,” Trump said. “JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!”

Before her appointment, Halligan had no prosecutorial experience, and her background was largely in insurance law. Previously, she served as a personal lawyer to Trump.

Within days of taking up her role as US attorney, Halligan had secured an indictment against Comey for allegedly lying to Congress and obstructing a Senate proceeding.

Then, on October 6, Halligan unveiled a second indictment against James, accusing her of mortgage fraud.

A third indictment arrived on October 16, this time against Trump’s former national security adviser, John Bolton.

All three have denied wrongdoing and claimed the charges were acts of political retribution. Comey, James and Bolton have all criticised Trump publicly, and James even successfully pursued a civil fraud case against Trump in New York state.

Comey, James seek dismissal

Lawyers for the defendants have explored multiple channels to have the cases dismissed before trial.

On November 13, Judge Currie heard opening arguments in one petition brought by James and Comey.

They asserted that Halligan’s appointment as US attorney was invalid, since she did not have judicial approval.

Normally, interim US attorneys may only stay in the position for a span of 120 days. After that period, federal judges in the district may decide who fills the role.

Siebert had served for a 120-day period and had gotten judicial permission to continue as acting US attorney until the Senate could confirm a permanent occupant for the role.

But Halligan did not have the judges’ approval. That made her appointment as US attorney illegal, according to lawyers for Comey and James.

Lawyers for the Justice Department, however, argued that the issue amounted to a mere “paperwork error” – and that Attorney General Bondi had signed off on the indictments.

Still, the hearings in Currie’s courtroom raised serious questions about the validity of the indictments.

Currie raised concerns that the grand jury transcript in Comey’s case was incomplete, an issue later echoed by Magistrate Judge William Fitzpatrick in a separate ruling on November 17.

He said the records indicate “a disturbing pattern of profound investigative missteps”, including misleading statements from the prosecutor and the use of an unrelated search warrant. He also pointed out that it seemed the final indictment against Comey had never been fully presented to the grand jury, as required.

In another courtroom last week, overseen by Judge Michael Nachmanoff, the Justice Department acknowledged that it had indeed failed to give the grand jury a chance to review the final Comey indictment.",literal
"Over the past couple of weeks, Shabana Mahmood has launched not only her new asylum crackdown policy, but also her “story”. The two are inseparable: her story justifies the crackdown. It moralises the crackdown. And it silences criticism of the crackdown. Sold as an origin story from within an immigrant and racialised experience, the purpose is to imbue her politics with sacred authenticity – the credibility of the first person. It is clever and effective. It is cynical and disgraceful.

“I am the child of immigrants” is how Mahmood now starts her fable. Immigrants who came here legally. She goes on to tell us that immigration is tearing this country apart, and proposes policies that mean UK-born children, who have known no life anywhere else, will be deported. As she launches policies that will leave refugees homeless and without support, tear families apart, punish those legally in the country for claiming any benefits and make settlement and security a long and arduous process, Mahmood declares: “this is a moral mission for me”.

A test of logic for sure, but the story can help. You see, after being accused of “stoking division” with “immoderate language”, Mahmood says “unfortunately, I am the one who is regularly called a ‘fucking Paki’ and told to ‘go back home’.” She knows – better than virtue-signalling white people – what the trenches actually look like. And so she must protect immigrants by hurting them. In her telling, racism and xenophobia seem not themselves objectively bad things that must be combatted, but a natural outcome that occurs when too many rights are given to immigrants and asylum seekers. If only they had fewer rights, then people wouldn’t hate them so much and we would hit some golden ratio where everyone will be happier. Because immigration perception and immigration reality are famously aligned things.

Credulous observers will quiver in the face of her personal conviction. Whatever you think of her politics, you’ve got to see that she means it. Because how can she not? She is brown and the daughter of immigrants! Let me break it to you gently: it is entirely possible for people of colour and the descendants of immigrants to be disingenuous and use their identities as excuses for their terrible politics. The former Conservative home secretary Suella Braverman dedicated her maiden speech in parliament to her father and mother, both immigrants. And yet, she later said “I would love to be having a front page of the Telegraph with a plane taking off to Rwanda. That’s my dream, it’s an obsession”.

Mahmood is not a novelty, just an addition to the ranks of Suella Braverman, Kemi Badenoch, Priti Patel and even Rishi Sunak, who in various forms used their identities to dictate what the correct immigration and race politics should be, because they’ve been there. Mahmood is just the first Labour politician to do so. Her contribution reveals two things. One is mundane, the other is structural. First, there is nothing unusual or new about immigrants creating different, lower classes of immigrants and then separating themselves from them: legal v illegal; working and housed v needing benefits; assimilated v ghettoised. But here is the structural part: being a politician of immigrant background is a powerful thing in a country utterly banjaxed by immigration discourse.

This is a sort of late-stage identity politics. A way in which the victim narrative so condemned by critics of “wokeness” remains holy and unquestionable when it is used for a purpose that isn’t equality. It’s using identity as a way to elevate and uphold stories that can be wielded in the service of authority, not to challenge it.

It takes a prodigious amount of stupidity or ignorance not to see that the home secretary provides that important service, at a time when the nation is riven by racism and xenophobia. Reform UK is ascendant, and the Labour government is trying to outflank the right while trying not to look enormously racist and xenophobic while doing so. Enter Mahmood to reassure you that it is, in fact, a sort of kindness to force children on to planes and eye up items that are not of “sentimental value” so that asylum seekers can contribute to their costs. Enter Mahmood to collapse all sorts of categories together, in one instance saying division is caused by asylum seekers, in another saying it is caused by the high recent rate of net immigration, expanding the numbers of people that need to be slapped with harsher conditions so they don’t force the public to become racist.

And it also requires a very short memory to believe that Mahmood is acting out of evangelist conviction, rather than convenience when, not too long ago, she supported a general amnesty for undocumented workers who have been living in the UK for 10 years, and in 2020 called on the Tory government to halt a deportation flight. She now vows to fight “vexatious last-minute claims” that “frustrate” removals.

But to show you the allure of being an anti-immigration immigrant, this will not be seen as a cynical reversal but, as the Spectator puts it, as a conversion – a final seeing of the light. And who cares about the embarrassing optics of it all, when the reward is Mahmood’s admission into the ranks of the contenders, the players? Much has been written, since her two-story debut, of the “new hard woman of British politics”, the proponent of “Mahmoodism”, a devout outsider driven by conviction politics, the next prime minister. Michael Gove is barely able to contain his excitement at the minister he considers “far and away the most impressive person in the Labour government”.

There is a sort of gamified glee to it all. The contrast between the pain Mahmood is about to inflict on some of the most vulnerable and desperate – exemplified by the flippant “sorry, we’re closing!” imagery that accompanied her announcement that asylum hotels will be shuttered – and the excitement she has triggered in the political discourse, tells its own story. Mahmood is here to provide the answer, to absolve. To free the country from its anxieties about immigration and race. To turn away from the hard work of confronting the economic failure, cultural capitulation and cowardice that has enabled the rise of the far right.

Mahmood’s story is seductive, because it allows us to believe that the problem is not a bigger one about a country where dark nativism lurks unchecked, and where scarcity and inequality are endemic, but rather about resentment and racism being naturally triggered by too many foreign bodies that need feeding, watering and housing. If the child of actual immigrants says so, if the target of actual racism believes so, then, thank god, how can we doubt it?",literal
"The US has attacked several Venezuelan boats and deployed its largest military buildup in Latin America in decades.

United States President Donald Trump’s campaign against “narcoterrorists” has transformed the Caribbean into a new battlefield.

Since August, Washington has deployed thousands of troops, warships and aircraft across the region, and reopened military bases in Puerto Rico and conducted drills, in what analysts describe as the largest US presence in Latin America in decades.

In September, the US began a series of strikes on Venezuelan boats it claims were trafficking drugs to the US, with the latest attack on Friday killing six people on board. Last week, Trump announced that he had authorised covert CIA operations in Venezuela and that he was even mulling a land attack.

However, on Thursday, Trump denied that all this amounts to a declaration of war on Venezuela.

“Well, I don’t think we’re going to necessarily ask for a declaration of war,” he said.

“I think we’re just going to kill people that are bringing drugs into our country. OK? We’re going to kill them,” Trump said.

How many Venezuelan boats has the US attacked?

The US military has carried out at least ten deadly strikes on vessels off Venezuela’s coast, and in the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean since September 2, marking the most intense American military activity in Latin America since the US invasion of Panama in 1989.

The operations, conducted under the authority of the US Southern Command (SOUTHCOM), have killed at least 43 people, according to statements by Trump and senior defence officials.

The map below shows the approximate locations of at least six of these attacks, according to data compiled by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data (ACLED). Most of these attacks occurred close to the Venezuelan coast and in international waters – raising questions about the legality of the US’s use of force, especially when no imminent threat was present.

What is SOUTHCOM?

US Southern Command (SOUTHCOM), headquartered in Doral, Florida, is one of 11 unified combatant commands of the US Department of War (renamed by Trump from the Department of Defense). It oversees operations in Central and South America and the Caribbean, including the defence of the Panama Canal.

The other 10 commands cover different regions or functions such as North America (NORTHCOM), Europe (EUCOM), Africa (AFRICOM), the Middle East (CENTCOM), and the Indo-Pacific (INDOPACOM), while others have global responsibilities like cyber operations (CYBERCOM), space (SPACECOM), nuclear deterrence (STRATCOM), strategic logistics (TRANSCOM) and Special Operations forces worldwide (SOCOM).

While SOUTHCOM’s current stated mission is to counter narcotics flows into the US, its growing presence near Venezuela has been interpreted as a sign of Trump’s strategic interest in the region.

What military assets have been deployed?

The military buildup is considerable and includes ready-to-deploy expeditionary forces, US naval and air assets, and special operations units.

Al Jazeera’s Defence Editor, Alex Gatopoulos, said, “It’s already the biggest build-up of US military assets in the region for decades. The present force is oriented for land attack and not for counter-narcotics operations.”

Expeditionary forces

The Iwo Jima Amphibious Ready Group (ARG) forms the expeditionary core of the US presence in the Caribbean. This group of Navy ships carrying marines, vehicles and helicopters, named after the famous World War II battle of Iwo Jima, is designed to land on a shore quickly, often in emergencies or combat situations.

Along with the USS San Antonio (LPD 17) and the USS Fort Lauderdale (LPD 28), the expeditionary force houses 4,500 sailors and marines, including 2,200 marines trained for amphibious assault and rapid reaction missions.

The group has also conducted live-fire drills on board the Iwo Jima and amphibious landing rehearsals off St Croix, the largest of the US Virgin Islands and a key training site for US forces.

Naval assets

The fleet is also reinforced with several naval assets. Late on Friday, the US announced it will send an aircraft carrier strike group to Latin America, in a major escalation of its military presence.

A spokesperson for the US military said that Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth ordered the USS Gerald Ford and five destroyers in its accompanying strike group to deploy to the region.

As of September 25, SOUTHCOM’s task force includes 10 major warships and several support vessels, exceeding the number normally assigned to the region. Among them are four surface combatants and one submarine capable of carrying Tomahawk long-range missiles.

The destroyers, USS Jason Dunham (DDG-109), USS Stockdale (DDG-106) and USS Gravely (DDG-107), are multi-role warships armed with Tomahawk land-attack missiles as well as advanced anti-air and anti-submarine systems. All three were reportedly deployed to the Red Sea in 2024 to counter Houthi attacks in the region.

Alongside them, the USS Newport News (SSN-750), a nuclear-powered fast attack submarine, provides capabilities for strikes, antiship and antisubmarine operations, as well as intelligence, reconnaissance and special operations.

There are also several noncombatant support ships, as well as the US Coast Guard.

Air assets

The air component deployed under SOUTHCOM includes some of the most advanced aircraft in the US Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force.

Gatopoulos states that, added to the various deployments “have been the intimidation tactics of flying strategic bombers close to Venezuelan airspace… The B-52 is designed to destroy land-based targets, from some distance away, usually using long-range cruise missiles.”

These heavy bombers can fly at altitudes of up to 50,000 feet (15,000 metres) and carry cruise missiles or nuclear-capable weapons. They also support naval operations by monitoring the ocean, targeting ships and laying mines.

“The B-1 strategic bomber is designed to penetrate enemy airspace to deliver 37 tonnes of ordnance onto its target. Neither jet is in any way useful for stopping drug-smuggling. This plus President Trump’s public announcement to the CIA to start operations within Venezuela tells me they have something very different in mind, namely to destabilise the Maduro government,” says Gatopoulos.

“The latest development, the ordering of the Gerald Ford Carrier Strike Group to the Caribbean further cements this idea. The Carrier group is immensely powerful, bringing with it 75+ fighter jets, helicopters and early warning aircraft. The USS Ford will be accompanied by three missile destroyers, each capable of attacking targets deep within Venezuela – a huge amount of firepower,” he added.

There are also at least 10 F-35 stealth fighters – highly versatile jets which can strike, fight and gather intelligence while remaining hard to detect by radar.

MQ-9 Reaper drones are remotely piloted aircraft used for surveillance and precision strikes, with a range of 1,851km (1,150 miles) and speeds up to 370km/h (230mph). They can carry up to 16 Hellfire missiles, allowing them to strike multiple targets in a single mission.

CH-53E Super Stallions are heavy-lift helicopters that move troops and equipment from ship to shore. They can carry 16 tonnes of cargo 80km (50 miles) before returning to base.

Other air assets include P-8 Poseidon patrol aircraft, MH-60 Seahawk helicopters, AC-130J gunships, and various support and reconnaissance aircraft.

Special forces and troops

SOUTHCOM’s special operations component consists of MH-60 Black Hawks and AH-MH-6 Little Bird helicopters for troop insertion and reconnaissance. The MC Ocean Trader, which is part of the deployment, acts as a mobile forward base for these units.

About 10,000 troops have also been sent to the US territory of Puerto Rico, while the White House has authorised the CIA to carry out covert operations inside Venezuela.

How has Venezuela responded?

On September 4, two Venezuelan F-16 fighter jets flew over the USS Jason Dunham in what was seen as a highly provocative act, according to Washington. In response, the US deployed 10 F-35B fighters and two MQ-9 Reapers to Puerto Rico.

On September 17, Venezuela launched large-scale naval and air exercises, while President Nicolas Maduro ordered the mobilisation of the Bolivarian militia, a reserve force which is part of Venezuela’s armed forces, the Bolivarian National Armed Forces (FANB), and called for millions of volunteers to defend the country’s sovereignty.

While President Trump insists that US operations in the Caribbean Sea are lawful counter-narcotics missions, Venezuelan officials regard them as an escalation in tensions and attacks on vessels as a violation of international law. It says there has been no evidence that targeted vessels have posed any imminent threat.",literal
"An Australian far-right lawmaker wore a burqa to Parliament on Monday, drawing outrage from fellow senators who accused her of racism.

Sen. Pauline Hanson appeared in the burqa, a full-face covering worn by some Muslim women, after she was denied permission to introduce a bill that would ban them in public.

Lawmakers erupted in anger as Hanson entered the chamber, and Senate proceedings were suspended when she refused to remove the garment.

“This is a racist senator displaying blatant racism and Islamophobia,” said Mehreen Faruqi, a Muslim senator from the state of New South Wales.

Another senator of the faith, Fatima Payman of Western Australia, said it was “disgraceful.”

“She is disrespecting the Muslims out there, Muslim Australians. It’s absolutely unconstitutional,” Payman said.

This is the second time Hanson, who represents the state of Queensland, has worn a burqa in Parliament, having done so previously in 2017 when she called for a nationwide ban.

Her stunt came amid growing support in Australia for anti-immigration policies and rhetoric, with her One Nation party doubling itself to four seats in May’s election.

Hanson’s actions drew rebuke from across the political spectrum, including both opposition and government leaders.

“Whatever our own beliefs may be, the sort of disrespect that you’re engaging in now is not worthy of a member of the Australian Senate,” said Penny Wong, the leader of Australia’s center-left Labor government in the Senate.

Hanson later said on Facebook that she wore the burqa to protest her bill’s not being introduced, “so that every Australian knows what’s at stake.”

“If they don’t want me wearing it — ban the burqa,” she said.",literal

My family and I have been watching post-season baseball, and I think I have to lie down.

We've seen so many ads for drugs prescribed to treat plaque psoriasis, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis that I'm sure I've developed a rash, nausea, joint pain and dizziness. Just by watching.

iSpot, the TV ad news site, says drug companies bought $895.8 million worth of ads in sports programming last year. The commercials that run during post-season baseball are rife with talk of dermatitis, dehydration, and wheezing. It's almost a relief to see just an ad for beer, or a lizard selling car insurance.

""The baseball playoffs are watched by millions,"" Dr. Caleb Alexander, of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine Center for Drug Safety and Effectiveness, reminds us. ""These games offer drug companies a captive audience, a lot with grey hair, who may have diabetes, obesity, high cholesterol and other common diseases.""

Prescription drug ads were once banned on broadcasts. But companies argued that infringed on free speech; and the drugs could help people. The FDA now permits pharmaceutical ads, as long as what regulators call ""dual-modality risk statements"" — possible side effects — are clearly stated.

And so you see commercials that show winsome old friends dancing, biking, and shooting down forested zip lines, despite the shadow of psoriasis, insomnia, anxiety or eczema.

Then the same soothing voice that advises you to see a doctor for a prescription cautions the medication might also lead you to develop symptoms of myelosuppression, psoriatic arthritis and abdominal swelling.

""Medicines are not inherently 'good' or 'bad,'"" advises Dr. Alexander. But direct-to-consumer advertising for drugs, he believes, ""may drive behavior in ways that patients, and doctors — keep in mind we are watching the baseball games, too — may not even be aware of. It's not just information,"" notes the doctor. ""It's persuasion.""

And so now, back to baseball. Enjoy the World Series! Dodgers and Blue Jays, sports-betting and beer, auto loans and iPhones. Allergies, high blood pressure, and narcolepsy. Headache, stomach acid and/or facial swelling. Consult a doctor. And do not operate heavy machinery while watching sports!",figurative
"The unions demand the laws be withdrawn before nationwide protests they plan to hold on Wednesday.

Ten large Indian trade unions have condemned the government’s rollout on Friday of new labour codes, the biggest such overhaul in decades, as a “deceptive fraud” against workers.

The unions, aligned with parties opposing Prime Minister Narendra Modi, demanded in a statement late on Friday that the laws be withdrawn before nationwide protests they plan to hold on Wednesday.

One of the trade unions, Centre of Indian Trade Unions, organised protest marches on Saturday in the eastern city Bhubaneswar, where hundreds of workers gathered and burned copies of the new labour codes.

Modi’s government implemented the four labour codes, approved by parliament five years ago, as it seeks to simplify work rules, some dating to British colonial rule, and liberalise conditions for investment.

It says the changes improve worker protections. While the new rules offer social security and minimum-wage benefits, they also allow companies to hire and fire workers more easily.

Unions have strongly opposed the changes, organising multiple nationwide protests over the past five years.

The Labour Ministry did not immediately respond on Saturday to a Reuters news agency request for comment on the union demands. The government has held over a dozen consultations with unions since June 2024, an internal ministry document on the labour codes shows.

The rules allow longer factory shifts and night work for women, while raising the threshold for firms that need prior approval for layoffs to 300 workers from 100, giving companies greater flexibility in workforce management.

Businesses have long criticised India’s work rules as a drag on manufacturing, which contributes less than a fifth to the country’s nearly $4 trillion economy.

But the Association of Indian Entrepreneurs expressed concern that the new rules would significantly increase operating costs for small and midsize enterprises and disrupt business continuity across key sectors.

It asked the government for transitional support and flexible implementation mechanisms. Not all unions oppose the overhaul.

The right-wing Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, aligned with Modi’s party, called on states to implement them after consultations on some of the codes. Indian states are expected to craft rules aligning with the new federal codes covering wages, industrial relations, social security and occupational safety.",literal
"20. Claws (2020)

Such was the extent of fan involvement in the How I’m Feeling Now album that the title of Claws was decided by online vote. The opposite of the album’s more fraught depictions of lockdown, it celebrates being trapped with someone you love, although the clanking rhythm track adds a vague sense of unease.

19. Taxi (2016)

According to one fan database, there are 260 unreleased Charli xcx tracks lurking around online. Taxi, from the scrapped album XCX World, remains the most celebrated for a reason: the funny, snotty saga of a midweek blind date gone wildly out of control, it’s a perfect example of Charli and producer Sophie’s skewed approach to pop.

18. Apple (2024)

The poppiest track on Brat – nearly binned midway through recording sessions – Apple’s earworm bubblegum melody carries a lyric about strained parental relationships and intergenerational trauma. It also went on to both spawn a viral TikTok dance craze and earn a Grammy nomination. The remix, featuring the Japanese House, feels sweeter still – and equally fantastic.

17. New Shapes (ft Caroline Polachek and Christine and the Queens) (2021)

It’s easy to view Brat’s predecessor, Crash, as Charli xcx trying to fit in with standard ideas about mainstream pop, rather than forging her own distinctive path. But its highlights are pretty high: New Shapes deploys both Christine and the Queens and Caroline Polachek over a fierce take on 80s electro.

16. Roll With Me (2017)

There used to be a rule of thumb that Charli xcx perversely released her best tracks not on her albums but her mixtapes. Listening to Roll With Me, you can see how that idea blossomed: producer Sophie provides relentless kick-drum thwack and sparse, super-spiky electronics, while Charli brings fabulous attitude-laden pop smarts.

15. Nuclear Seasons (2011)

If you’re looking for early evidence that Charli xcx was different, then this track from her debut EP, later to become the opener for her debut album, is a good place to start. The lyrics mix up relationship trauma, post-apocalyptic imagery and the suggestion that pop culture is a state of decay; the music reboots doomy 80s synth pop. It’s also insanely catchy.

“I went my own way and I made it / I’m your favourite reference, baby … I don’t fucking care what you think”: 360 is both the sound of the Brat era swaggering (or perhaps staggering) into view and a superb pop song, whether you opt for the original or the Robyn and Yung Lean-assisted remix.

13. I Got It (2017)

The Pop 2 mixtape sounded like Charli xcx and her collaborators trying to will a more interesting, provocative pop landscape into being: on I Got It, extravagantly foul-mouthed rapper Cupcakke, Brazilian drag queen vocalist Pabllo Vittar and pansexual shape-shifting US singer Brooke Candy do their thing over a minimal, thrillingly futuristic musical backdrop.

12. House (2025)

However you might have expected Charli xcx to follow up Brat, it’s unlikely that you expected this, from the forthcoming soundtrack to Wuthering Heights: a warped electronic homage to the Velvet Underground, filled with drones, shards of noise and a guest appearance from John Cale, which bursts into furious distortion-laden industrial noise at its climax.

11. Club Classics (2024)

Pop has hardly wanted for songs about nightclubs, but few of them have captured the small hours dancefloor’s manic sense of euphoria like Club Classics. It feels chaotic, relentless and artificially accelerated, and celebrates complete abandon: “Sweat marks on all my clothes … I wanna be blinded by the lights.”

10. Gone (ft Christine and the Queens) (2019)

Another Christine and the Queens collaboration, Gone improbably transforms the lyrical topic of crushing social anxiety – “I feel so unstable / I fucking hate these people” – into anthemic pop. There’s a powerful sense of catharsis about the way it explodes from brooding verses into a banging, exhilarating chorus.

9. Backseat (ft Carly Rae Jepsen) (2017)

Charli xcx and Carly Rae Jepsen once drunkenly plotted to make an album together; their solitary IRL collaboration is marvellous. Thematically, Backseat feels like two different songs – one about a breakup, the other about the alienating nature of celebrity – perfectly joined by the chorus (“I’m alone”) and shifting, inventive electronic backing.

8. Boys (2017)

By latter-day xcx standards, Boys is musically and lyrically straightforward – a giddy reverie of lust set to a suitably daydreamy backing – but it’s utterly charming and joyful. Extra points for the video, which featured the lead singer of Vampire Weekend lurking among its parade of heavily muscled objects of desire.

7. Anthems (2020)

Written and recorded as Covid raged, its lyrics crowdsourced with fans online, Anthems perfectly captures those lockdown moments when the urge to, as Charli put it, “go out, blow off some steam, get fucked up” became overwhelming. If its sound is intense to the point of seeming a bit nuts, well, that’s how it felt.

6. Boom Clap (2014)

Originally intended for former Disney star Hilary Duff (she rejected it), the song’s author turned Boom Clap into the highlight of her second album, Sucker, and her first US Top 10 hit. No wonder: it’s hugely catchy and impressively classy, the hooky chorus set amid chugging, pulsing synths – though she hates it now.

5. Next Level Charli (2019)

A paean to her fans, packed with references to her past work, the brilliance of Next Level Charli lies in the gulf between the music, which lulls the listener into believing they’re going to get a dreamy, 80s-influenced ballad, and the gobby, playground-chant stridency of the vocal: “In the rave – go for ever and ever!”

4. Von Dutch (2024)

You could call Von Dutch a diss track – it’s rumoured to be aimed at FKA twigs – but it feels more like an infectious expression of self-confidence: someone who knows she has hit her imperial phase, and has created an irresistible, epochal pop single almost entirely out of grinding, revving noise to prove it.

3. Vroom Vroom (2015)

A step into the leftfield that got decidedly mixed reviews on release, Vroom Vroom now feels like the birth of Charli xcx 2.0, harnessing her songwriting skills to the skeletal, avant-pop sound of PC Music affiliate Sophie. A decade ago it felt completely removed from mainstream pop trends; today it sounds incredibly prescient.

2. Girl, So Confusing (2024)

A different class to the usual pop-star-writes-prickly-song-about-fellow-pop-star fare, Girl, So Confusing is both an amazing song and a heartwarming saga. The original version depicted a fraught relationship with Lorde, accompanied by a synthesiser that fizzes and growls; the remix featured Lorde herself answering the criticisms and movingly explaining her own issues.

1. Track 10 (2017)

On the face of it, Track 10, from her mixtape Pop 2, is an unlikely list-topper. It’s a remix of a demo – eventually reworked into the Lizzo-featuring 2019 single Blame It on Your Love – with what looks like a placeholder title. But it’s also a masterpiece: an epic ballad that’s both wildly experimental and genuinely affecting. The lyrics sound like a drunken confession from someone who can’t stop her insecurities destroying a relationship. Anyone else might have been inclined to play a song like that straight, but somehow, the overload of theoretically alienating electronics – glitches and distortion, wilfully excessive AutoTune, icy maximalist rave synths – only amplifies its impact.",figurative
"Opinion: It's time to 'move our feet'

toggle caption Bruce Kluckhohn/AP

The tragedy this week at Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis marked the first school shooting of the new school year. It's heartbreaking and outrageous to have to note that there will almost certainly be more. Education Week, which tracks shootings at K through 12 schools, says there were more than two dozen during the last school year.

Once again, we hear about children — children — crying and scrambling to try to protect one another in a place where they should be safe. We sputter for words that have become dulled from repetition — like ""tragic,"" ""heartbreaking,"" and ""outrageous"" — because, as Minnesota's Governor Tim Walz said this week at one of the press conferences of grim-faced public officials, ""There shouldn't be words for these types of incidents since they should not happen.""

But it has come to happen over and over in America. Children run for their lives from classrooms and playgrounds. Reporters write obituaries remembering youngsters who had just begun to live. We offer prayers, thoughts, and vows that such an abominable crime must never happen again. And then it does.

Those inside the church Wednesday morning were at prayer to begin the school day. Matthew DeBoer, the principal of Annunciation Catholic School, told a press conference that he'd planned for this school year's theme to come from the Book of Jeremiah: ""a future filled with hope.""

""There's nothing that happened today that can fill us with hope,"" the principal said. ""We lost two angels today…""

""We can't change the past,"" he said. ""But we can do something about the future. There's an African proverb that says, 'When you pray, move your feet.'… So I beg you, and I ask you to please pray, but don't stop with your words. Let's make a difference and support this community, these children, these families and teachers, never again can we let this happen.""

Archbishop Bernard Hebda spoke next. As he addressed reporters, the church bell began ringing to mark the hour.

""The bell in the Catholic church is always a call to prayer,"" said the Archbishop, ""so it's a reminder for us for sure to be praying. And we have to recognize that it's through prayer and through that prayer of the feet, through that action, that we can indeed make a difference. That has to be the source of our hope.""",figurative
"When Dean Martin announced the Kessler sisters’ appearance on his show in 1966, he remarked that he had been desperate to book them not just because the German-born dancer-singers were “so pretty and so talented”, but “also because they’re twins, that means there are two of them”. “They’re a double,” he added with a nod to his half-drunk crooner persona, “and there’s nothing I like more than a double”.

The two sisters, who died by joint assisted suicide earlier this week, also performed with Frank Sinatra, Harry Belafonte and Fred Astaire, but the American market never impressed them much. In 1964 they turned down a role in Elvis’s Viva Las Vegas for fear of being pigeonholed in American musical comedies.

Instead, it was in continental Europe that the duo truly left a mark on culture – in their native Germany but especially so in Italy, where they broke the mould of acceptable mainstream TV entertainment and paved the way for a new generation of empowered female performers.

Born in 1936 in Saxony, Alice and Ellen Kessler joined the Leipzig Opera children’s ballet two years after the end of the second world war and were due to move straight on to the attached dance school. But after escaping through the iron curtain to join their father in Düsseldorf in 1952, their breakthrough came in West Germany instead. They acted in a string of popular musical comedies, and in 1955 they were discovered by the director of the Lido cabaret theatre in Paris and became part of Margaret Kelly’s Bluebell Girls. They represented West Germany at Eurovision in 1959, an experience they later called ein misserfolg (“a flop”) – their entry, Heute abend woll’n wir tanzen geh’n, (Tonight We Want to Go Dancing) placed 8th out of 12.

It was their move to Italy in the early 1960s that turned them into true showbiz icons. They made their debut on Italian TV in the variety show Giardino d’Inverno (Winter Garden) in 1961, which evolved into Studio Uno the same year. For Studio Uno, they danced and sang the opening theme tunes, most notably Da-da-un-pa, a typical show tune with a fun-and-fancy nonsense chorus. Upon seeing them, screenwriter and playwright Ennio Flaiano chauvinistically described them as “two pairs of legs and one head”.

But beneath the glitz was serious craftswomanship. French cabaret, Austro-German operetta, their ballet training and Broadway all influenced their act as soubrettes – the French word used by Italians to indicate women who could sing, dance, and banter with equal confidence.

The emphasis was always on their foot- and legwork, and in culturally conservative 1960s Italy, showing exposed legs was still deemed scandalous to the point that they had to have them covered with thick, opaque tights. In his obituary for Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, journalist, author and TV history scholar Aldo Cazzullo noted that it was only after a couple of years’ worth of performances that the Kesslers were allowed to wear nylon tights.

This, in turn, provided commercial opportunities: hosiery titan Omsa promptly hired them for commercials in which they were joined by impish choreographer Don Lurio, in a segment aptly titled “Che gambe!” (“What legs!”). Their other big Studio Uno hit, 1965’s La notte è piccola, confidently affirmed their right to have fun: “The night is too short for us,” they sang. “There’s little time to dance and sing”.

While they did fewer variety performances in the 1970s, they posed in the nude, at the age of 39, for the January 1975 Playboy Italia issue, which achieved the 1975 equivalent of virality, outselling any previous issue. Their combination of song, dance and non-vulgar sensuality proved immensely influential for the leading showgirls of the 1970s and 80s, serving as the blueprint for Raffaella Carrà, the biggest and most enduring star to emerge from Italy’s variety show culture. Carrà bared her midriff like the twins had shown their legs; her hits Ma che musica and Felicità tà tà feel like spiritual successors of Da-da-un-pa and La notte è piccola; and the twins appeared to symbolically pass the baton to the next generation when they appeared as guests on an April 1974 episode of variety show Milleluci hosted by Carrà and vocal powerhouse Mina. In one segment, the four women sang about an aspect of their performance and their physiques that most appealed to male viewers. As Italian TV historian Rachel Haworth writes in her book The Many Meanings of Mina, this moment seemed to be both a product of the male gaze and a sly subversion, “as the women use their bodies to illustrate their objectification”.

Alice and Ellen remained inseparable even after they retired from show business. In the early 1960s, clad in top hats, shimmery bodices, they had sung Wir wollen niemals auseinandergeh’n (“we never want to be apart”), a 1959 schlager by Heidi Brühl. The original is an operetta-like waltz and a proclamation of endless romantic love, but the twins’ swing-like take emphasised their sisterly and artistic bond: “Wir wollen immer zueinandersteh’n / Mag auf der grossen Welt auch noch soviel gescheh’n”. “We always want to stand side-by-side / Whatever happens in the big wide world”.

In a 2024 interview they gave to the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, they stated: “Our desire is to leave this world together, on the same day – the idea of one of us going first is very hard to bear.”",literal
"‘It felt to me as if the world had forgotten about the Frank Sinatra or Elvis Presley of folk, or a singular figure in the mould of Willie Nelson, Johnny Cash or Richard Thompson.” So says Colin Harper, curator of a slew of new releases celebrating the stunning music of Scottish musician Dick Gaughan. Harper had recently reconnected with his music after several decades, “and I couldn’t believe the quality of it. His singing and guitar playing were astonishing – he performed traditional songs and championed social justice so powerfully.”

But if you haven’t heard of the 77-year-old Gaughan, it’s not surprising: much of his work has been unavailable for years, the rights to it having been claimed by the label Celtic Music, who have not made it available digitally. Gaughan doesn’t recall receiving a royalty statement from the company in 40 years. He is battling for ownership and, in turn, hopes to help other veteran folk artists regain control of their catalogues. “To find that the music I made, that I put a lot of work into, is just not available – it’s like your life isn’t available,” he says.

Born in Glasgow in 1948, and raised in Leith in an impoverished musical family, Gaughan became a jobbing musician at 22, later recording 12 solo albums and multiple collaborations. Capable of both stunning delicacy and fiery spirit in his performances, he recorded nine sessions for John Peel (solo and in groups), who said during one of his 1977 shows: “He’s a singer so good that prolonged exposure to him could drive you daft.”

Gaughan became a much-loved regular at folk clubs up and down the country. Later in his career, he brilliantly led Emmylou Harris, Kate and Anna McGarrigle and Kate’s 21-year-old son Rufus Wainwright on folk ballad Wild Mountain Thyme, on a 1995 episode of Scottish/Irish TV show Transatlantic Sessions. “I was so lucky to work with Dick Gaughan at an impressionable age,” says Wainwright. “His ability affected my singing for the duration.”

Richard Hawley also saw him in the 2000s at Greystones folk club in Sheffield. “It was very quickly apparent to me that this man was a force to be reckoned with,” he says. “It was a night of powerful song that I’ll never forget.”

Gaughan’s most successful album, 1981’s Handful of Earth – a mixture of political songs and tender ballads recorded after he recovered from a breakdown – is still startling. Hawley calls it “another league away from most things in any genre of music I’ve ever heard”. It was a significant influence on Billy Bragg, who loved Gaughan’s version of The World Turned Upside Down, which he re-recorded and still performs regularly live. On the cover, Gaughan stands dressed in black like a Gaelic Johnny Cash, knee-deep in golden wheat, with a hulking cement works brooding behind him.

Harper, an author, composer and box-set compiler, was shocked to discover that only a 2019 CD remaster of this album, an introductory CD on Topic Records (gleaned from only three albums Gaughan released for that label) and a live recording from 1982, had been reissued in the last 20 years. “This is someone with a similar cultural standing in Scotland as Bert Jansch or Christy Moore in Ireland,” he says. “I felt that the universe was telling me I had to do something about this.”

So he assembled a team (working for nothing, like him, or at “ultra mates’ rates”) to license, promote and create a lavish seven-CD and DVD package, complete with liner notes and archive interviews, after several reissue labels rejected his approaches. Crowdfunding had facilitated other folk projects, he noticed, such as the forthcoming film about folklorist Doc Rowe, and the publication of fRoots magazine editor Ian A Anderson’s memoir, Alien Water. When Harper’s crowdfunding campaign launched in March, “we hoped that we might be able to raise £28,000 from fans within a month”. He remains shocked at what happened next. “We got that amount in a day.”

He raised £91,985 in total. It prompted him to curate other collections including Live at the BBC: 1972-79, released this month. But the Dick Gaughan Legacy Project, as it is now called, has not been without hurdles. Harper tried and failed to license material from Celtic Music, the entity that acquired several legendary folk labels in the 1980s, including Trailer and Leader (which had gone bankrupt).

Today, Celtic Music claims ownership of eight albums featuring Gaughan’s work, from his 1972 debut album No More Forever to 1995’s Clan Alba, a LP by a folk supergroup, including Patsy Seddon and Brian McNeill, which Gaughan led and produced. None are available to stream. All have been unavailable on CD for decades, except Clan Alba, which can currently be bought from Celtic Music Distribution on Amazon Marketplace for £32.

Despite initial contact in which they referred to unspecified “inaccuracies” in points put to them by the Guardian, Celtic Music did not respond to a list of detailed questions.

Gaughan is now living a quiet life in Edinburgh, partially sighted, and having retired from performing in 2016 after suffering an earlier stroke. The renewed interest in his work has moved him. “At the time, I did the gigs and the records without worrying too much about how it was received, because that was never my primary intention,” he says. “It’s been wonderful to realise all that actually meant something to so many people.” But, he adds, the battles with Celtic Music over the years have been “frustrating and very depressing”, and he says it’s not about the money.

Celtic Music is not listed on Companies House. Nor is Northworks, the publishing entity affiliated with Celtic Music, which claims 100% mechanical royalties (payments made whenever a song is sold physically, downloaded or streamed) to 61 of Gaughan’s works, and from whom Gaughan says he has never received a royalty statement. In July, emboldened by the interest in his music, Gaughan formally registered challenges to the companies’ claims to his publishing with the Performing Right Society (PRS): the contested works were frozen in September, the royalties held until the dispute is resolved and the rightful owner can be established.

On behalf of Gaughan, Harper also launched a GoFundMe campaign to help him raise £45,000 to cover legal fees to test Celtic Music’s claims: to date, the total has reached 90%, and supporters include Woody Guthrie’s daughter, Nora Guthrie, and multimillionaire music industry investor Merck Mercuriadis, who has also “made himself available to give generous advice and contacts”, says Harper.

If successful, the effects of Gaughan’s actions will be far-reaching in the folk world. Other artists who have made albums claimed but not yet reissued by Celtic Music include Nic Jones (whose performing career was cut short after a car accident in 1982), Martin Simpson, Barbara Dickson and Barry and Robin Dransfield. Celtic Music also won a case against Domino Records in 2018, blocking sales of a 2017 reissue of Lal and Mike Waterson’s critically acclaimed 1972 album, Bright Phoebus, put together after the death of Celtic Music’s founder, Dave Bulmer. In a press release after the court hearing, Celtic Music promised a “programme of rereleases”, which remains eagerly awaited seven years on. Bright Phoebus is currently unavailable on Amazon. “I’m delighted that Dick Gaughan is testing the legal grounds around the continued Celtic Music claiming and hoarding of so much music from the past that people care about,” says Marry Waterson, daughter of the late Lal.

The enthusiasm with which people have received the Dick Gaughan Legacy Project, however, gives Harper hope. He has already been able to give Gaughan a substantial amount of money from the Kickstarter campaign; “his first real earnings from music for years”, he says. “We’ve shown there’s an audience for Dick’s music, and so many people want to correct what I call this legacy gap in folk.”

Gaughan expresses his feelings more simply, with his trademark, gentle power. “I never wanted to sing into a vacuum. I wanted to sing my songs to real human beings who are listening.”",literal
"Goon, the 2015 debut album by Canada-born LA musician Tobias Jesso Jr, was one of the revelations of the 2010s. An album of heartfelt, earnest ballads in the vein of 70s singer-songwriters such as Randy Newman and Harry Nilsson, it instantly established Jesso as a rising indie star and was one of the year’s most acclaimed records. The problem was that Jesso didn’t care much for the attention: he struggled to feel like a genuine performer, leading him to drink heavily before shows, and felt he was playing a version of himself in interviews. “I was forced to do all these things I wasn’t really confident in,” he says. “I was just like … I don’t know what I’m doing, anywhere.” So, toward the end of his breakout year, he cancelled all future shows and, in essence, put his career on ice.

In the decade that followed, he kept himself behind the scenes, in the process becoming one of the world’s most successful and in-demand pop songwriters – thanks, in no small part, to his focus on simple, emotions-first songwriting. He co-wrote Adele’s hit When We Were Young and a handful of tracks on Dua Lipa’s 2024 album Radical Optimism; has collaborated with Harry Styles, Justin Bieber, FKA twigs and Haim; and in 2023 won the first ever Grammy for songwriter of the year.

Now, a decade on from his first record, and with little notice, Jesso has released Shine, its equally heartfelt follow-up. Speaking over Zoom from his home in Silver Lake, Los Angeles, he seems as surprised as anyone that he’s stepping back into the spotlight. “Getting into the songwriting thing, you learn all these tricks of the trade,” he says. “I had to forget all those and go: ‘What do I want to say? How do I want to say it?’ I knew with this, if I was really going to stand behind it, I needed to make [it] the uncompromised version of myself.”

View image in fullscreen He writes the songs … Tobias Jesso Jr. Photograph: Justin Chung

At only eight tracks, totalling less than 30 minutes – all, once again, featuring only Jesso and his piano – Shine is a modest album. But its waters run deep, touching on his mother’s dementia diagnosis as well as fatherhood – Jesso shares a young son with his ex-wife, the Australian songwriter Emma Louise. He began to have an inkling that he wanted to write for himself again after his breakup earlier this year – a feeling he hadn’t experienced since he was writing Goon.

“I like to share my stories in [songwriting] sessions and use things from my life to fill in the gaps, but I never really felt like I had a whole song to say,” he says. “Before this album, I was doing sessions and going through a breakup, and I had to process a lot. I found myself not wanting to share special lines or things that would come to me because they were so rooted to me. I just had this gut knowing that I needed to work these songs out myself.”

Around the beginning of May, Jesso blocked six weeks out from his schedule – the longest break from his day-to-day songwriting work he’d ever taken – and set to work writing Shine. Some of the songs on the album are brand new; others are reworked from Jesso’s huge folder of unused ideas that he’s amassed over the past decade. The first song he finished was the album’s opening track, Waiting Around, a scorching postmortem of his breakup: “You were upset / Every other morning / Like a sharp knife / Had me dancing on edge,” he sings.

In recent years, pop has been dominated by tabloid-baiting pop that tempts listeners into trying to work out the real-life narrative behind the songs: think Olivia Rodrigo’s Drivers License, about a real-life love triangle, or Lily Allen’s recently released, much discussed West End Girl, a tell-all about her divorce from the actor David Harbour. Jesso says that he “didn’t want to fall on any tricks” when it came to writing about his personal life. “I didn’t want to use names or any little dates or stuff: I wanted to make it for me, a song that I felt like would convey exactly where I am and what I’m going through,” he says. “I wasn’t trying to be disrespectful … When I finished [that song], I was like: ‘Man, I just wrote one of my songs again, holy fuck! It’s amazing that I did that.’”

I want to find the artists who want to get a little bit more unique, not just chase something that’s already been done

One song on the album – the dramatic, intense I Love You, which builds to a clattering maelstrom – had a less conventional genesis. During a reading from Wendy L’Belle-Tividad, an LA psychic whose client list includes a number of high-profile musicians, Jesso was told that there was a song missing from Shine, which was “really dramatic”. The next time he was sitting at the piano, he wrote I Love You, undeniably the loudest and most dramatic song he’s ever written, building to an intense, alarming climax that sounds like a door slamming over and over. “That’s my favourite song I’ve written to date,” he says. “But here’s the thing: I’m like, was it inception or was it a psychic reading?”

While Shine does bear great resemblance to Goon – which definitely has something to do with Jesso’s distinctive, pleading timbre – it’s also undeniably the work of someone who has been in the pop trenches for the better part of a decade, in part because of the poppy structure of the songs and in part because of credited collaborators such as Tommy King and Julian Bunetta, fixtures of the LA pop scene. While Jesso says that, for the most part, he tried to ignore his big-budget pop instincts, he credits Justin Bieber, with whom Jesso worked on his recent albums Swag and Swag II, as a bolstering force.

“The sessions with Justin were right before I wrote this stuff, and he is the most insane, courageous artist – [he’ll] just get on a mic and start singing something, and it sounds like a song. It just happens so naturally,” he says. “[Working with him] was so raw compared with these pop sessions where they’re like: ‘What’s on the Top 40?’ – there was no trickery. It was mind-boggling that at his level, he was doing something that I was scared to do. It changed my perspective on a lot of things.”

Those kinds of sessions, he says, are rare. “I’m still disenchanted with how a lot of pop music gets made – it’s a little bit of a cop-out. I’ve been party to it as well, so I can safely say I also am embarrassed about being party to it,” he says. “I feel very grateful for [being] able to work with artists that I don’t feel like would ever put themselves into that sort of deplorable writing; the artists I choose to write with would also kind of cringe at a few of those Top 40 songs.”

He continues: “I’m not dogging anyone for writing pop songs in any way, you know? Write all the pop songs you want. Maybe it is about money.” Jesso does not name names, but it’s easy enough to conjure the kind of music he’s talking about: disposable, trend-chasing pop that’s heavily reliant on samples or references, or which simply rehashes older, well-trodden ideas. “I want to find the artists who don’t agree with that and maybe want to get a little bit more unique and push a little bit more, and not just stay in the zone where you’re chasing something that’s already been done.”

View image in fullscreen Shine on … Tobias Jesso Jr. Photograph: Justin Chung

One such artist he’s worked with recently is Olivia Dean, the Brit School graduate whose second album, The Art of Loving, released in September, is one of the year’s genuine breakout records. Dean recently sold out four dates at the O2 in London, with two more on their way there; Man I Need, a 70s-ish lounge single co-written by Jesso, peaked at No 5 on the US Hot 100 chart. “Olivia is a great example of … Some people you just meet and you just go: ‘You got it – you’re a force,’” he says. “You can see when someone carries their own integrity and their own assurance of what they’re doing, and for a songwriter, that’s the most exciting thing. Somebody who’s very strong in their opinion is like a godsend to me.”

Even so, Jesso says artists such as Bieber and Dean are probably outliers. “I don’t know that the pendulum seems like it’s gonna swing back to like, 70s-style songwriting or quality – putting it in for the craft – with AI and everything that’s happening now,” he says. “It’s gonna get a lot worse. People are already using AI for everything, so it’s like: cool now it’s not even gonna be human.”

Although Jesso prefers to be the only songwriter in a room with an artist, there are exceptions where he doesn’t mind being one of a handful of credited songwriters, as was the case when working on Dua Lipa’s Radical Optimism. “Going in with Dua and getting to work with Dua, and getting to work with Kevin [Parker of Tame Impala], getting to work with Danny [L Harle], and all these people, it’s like a dream. Having names on the board doesn’t matter if they’re all people you really want to work with,” he says. It was a similar experience, he says, working in France with Bieber and his collaborators. “Usually when you see 10 names on a song, you’re going: ‘Probably four of those didn’t do shit. Or just changed a word.’ But those motherfuckers put themselves on the line for all of those songs – every name on there is a name that should be on there.”

Working on Shine hasn’t changed the fact that Jesso still wants to keep his day job as a behind-the-scenes songwriter, though he’s due for another upheaval. He’s about to move to a farm he owns in Byron Bay, Australia, where he plans to spend half the year in order to be close to his son, who’s about to start school there. “I’ve got a few close friends close by, which is really good, but it’s going to be a big new start and a big change. I guess there’s a lot of space for not really knowing if it’s going to be filled with joy or sadness,” he says. “Over the last five years, I’ve tried to find a way to bring more life into the mix, more than just work, because I think for a long period of time in my life, it was just all work – it was an obsession, almost. This is sort of a big test: can I handle months of life without too much work?”

Shine won’t require too much of the stuff he hated circa Goon – he’s doing few interviews and will probably only play one or two shows, “just to show people the songs … like, three-song sets”, he says. “I don’t know that performing will ever be me; it just doesn’t feel like something that’s ever me. I don’t think I see myself in front of an audience,” he says. “I’m getting ready and prepared for the move, but you know, if I’m like, depressed in Australia, I’m gonna have my piano – maybe I write a bunch more songs, maybe I don’t.”

Or, to put it even more succinctly: “I think 10 years away for me is pretty comfortable.”

"Pentagon suggests Mark Kelly, a former US Navy captain, could be court-martialled for urging military to defy unlawful orders.

The Pentagon has said it is investigating United States Senator Mark Kelly, a retired naval aviator and astronaut, for his participation in a video that urged military service members to refuse “illegal orders”.

It is unusual for the US military to take action against a retired officer. But Monday’s announcement came after President Donald Trump repeatedly called for criminal charges against Kelly and other Democratic lawmakers involved in the video.

Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth said later on Monday that Kelly is facing a probe because he is the only lawmaker in the video who falls under the jurisdiction of military law as a retired Navy captain.

“As was announced, the Department is reviewing his statements and actions, which were addressed directly to all troops while explicitly using his rank and service affiliation – lending the appearance of authority to his words,” Hegseth wrote on X.

“Kelly’s conduct brings discredit upon the armed forces and will be addressed appropriately.”

The senator was quick to respond with defiance to the Pentagon’s move.

“If this is meant to intimidate me and other members of Congress from doing our jobs and holding this administration accountable, it won’t work,” Kelly said in a statement. “I’ve given too much to this country to be silenced by bullies who care more about their own power than protecting the Constitution.”

The Pentagon had suggested that Kelly is accused of “actions intended to interfere with the loyalty, morale, or good order and discipline of the armed forces”.

Last week, Trump described the legislators as traitors and went as far as arguing that they should face the death penalty for sedition: in other words, speech that is designed to incite a rebellion.

Kelly, a former US Navy captain who now represents Arizona in the Senate, was one of six former military and intelligence officers featured in the video, released on November 18.

“Our laws are clear. You can refuse illegal orders,” they said in the video.

The Pentagon stressed that under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) — which spells out military laws and guidelines — service members have a legal obligation to “obey lawful orders and that orders are presumed to be lawful”.

“A servicemember’s personal philosophy does not justify or excuse the disobedience of an otherwise lawful order,” it wrote in Monday’s statement.

The Pentagon added that Kelly could face recall “to active duty for court-martial proceedings or administrative measures”.

Retired military personnel who continue to receive benefits after their service remain subject to military law, according to the UCMJ.

But it is rare for military courts to prosecute former service members, especially for alleged offences committed after their tenure.

In recent days, Democrats have expressed outrage over Trump’s response to the lawmakers’ videos, which they say amounts to a death threat.

Democrats have also argued that the video simply reaffirms a fact of military law: Service members are required to refuse orders they know to be in violation of the US law, as part of their oath to the Constitution.

The controversy came as the US continues to reel from political violence after the assassination of right-wing commentator Charlie Kirk in September and the killing of Democratic Minnesota state lawmaker Melissa Hortman in June.

Trump first invoked the death penalty on Thursday, sparking a firestorm of criticism. “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!” Trump wrote on social media.

Despite the outrage, Trump doubled down on his stance late on Saturday, saying in a social media post that the legislators who released the video “SHOULD BE IN JAIL RIGHT NOW”.

The Pentagon’s move on Monday signals that federal agencies, led by Trump appointees, are willing to respond to the president’s political grievances.

The Department of Justice pursued criminal charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James and former FBI Director James Comey in now-dismissed cases that critics say were political.

Comey was charged with lying to Congress, while James was facing mortgage fraud accusations.

Later on Monday, the White House expressed support for the Pentagon’s investigation of Kelly. “You can’t have a functioning military if there is disorder and chaos within the ranks. And that’s what these Democrat members were encouraging,” Trump’s press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters.",figurative
"With another set of global climate talks behind us, the Australian government faces some tricky tasks before it takes over negotiations at the next round of talks next year in Turkey.



Cop30 in Belém, Brazil, did not deliver the bold fossil fuel phase-out roadmap we needed, but it did nudge the system forward with more scrutiny of fossil fuel producers.



And despite the weakness of the outcome, one can gain some important comfort by the fact that Bélem – and the G20 in Johannesburg at the weekend – both solidly endorsed the Paris agreement, its central goal of keeping warming to 1.5C and the importance of net zero emissions.



Cop30 agreed that an “ambition accelerator” will be needed to fill the gap between what governments are planning (projected to warm the world by 2.6C) and the agreed guardrails of the Paris agreement: a limit of 1.5C.



It also, crucially, began the momentum for developing a roadmap for a just transition away from fossil fuels, with more than 80 countries – including Australia – signing the “Belém declaration” on a transition away from fossil fuels.

While this declaration didn’t get support from the whole conference, Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has promised to move forward on its implementation during the course of this year, until he hands over to Cop31 in Turkey.

And there, Australia, under its deal with Turkey, will take over that momentum.

But there are significant questions as to whether the government will be able – or more importantly willing – to move this momentum for a fossil fuel phase-out forward.



This is especially so given that the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has just doubled down on his patently false claim that gas is needed for the energy transition.

The International Energy Agency released its annual report in the first week of Cop30. Its net zero emissions pathway confirms our concerns about Australian gas. The IEA’s new net zero scenario clearly states there is no need for new long-lead oil and gas projects, or coalmines.



It says fossil gas use needs to reduce quickly to 40% below today’s levels by 2035. Importantly, it also warns that a massive glut of liquefied natural gas supply is developing, a glut that is consistent with the IEA’s current policy scenario that would warm the world by 3C by 2100.



Gas is not needed to replace coal, and is not doing so across Asia – the destination for the vast majority of Australian fossil gas exports.



Add to this the leaked Deloitte draft report to the Western Australian government that warned Australia’s gas export bonanza to Asia would crowd out renewables and lock in CO 2 emissions for years to come.



Yet yesterday the prime minister was still dancing around this question, saying Australia’s gas would be needed as a backup to renewables but also that this “firming” would not require any new gas fields and should see the government move toward a phase-out of the massive export program it has approved all the way to 2070.

The truth is that much less gas is going to be needed to “firm” renewables, as grid-scale battery technologies take over the market.

In the next breath Albanese confirmed that his government would continue to allow new gas fields to go ahead, just as he allowed the massive North West Shelf development go ahead to 2070.



These two statements are in direct contradiction with each other and do not bode well for the prospect of his government moving forward a global agreement that aims to get the world to transition away from fossil fuels.

The IEA has also confirmed that carbon capture and storage is not the magic bullet Australia claims it is to deal with fossil gas emissions. Indeed our work shows that if Asian countries – and Australia – continue with expansion plans for deploying CCS, they could add an extra 25bn tonnes of CO 2 emissions to the atmosphere by 2050.

There are many in Australia’s political scene who ask, what does all of this have to do with us?



For those who love Australia’s bush, forests, coral reefs, marine life and ecosystems, I would say nearly everything. Because all of this depends on keeping warming to 1.5C.

This month we’ve also seen reports emerge of massive coral mortality at Ningaloo reef, caused by climate change-fuelled marine heatwaves. This reef and others like it are finished unless we can get fossil fuels phased out quickly and achieve net zero CO 2 in the next 25 years or so.



It’s physics. Getting to net zero CO 2 globally means we can halt global warming.

And getting to net zero CO 2 means rapidly phasing out fossil fuels. There’s simply no other way.

Australia cannot continue to develop and expand fossil fuel exports and pretend it’s going to be a renewable superpower supporting a 1.5C limit.

These contradictions will come into sharp focus over the next year and they are likely to get increasingly dangerous for the Albanese government as people wake up to the climate catastrophe unfolding around them, while watching their government fumble on the world stage.",literal
