Fumbling a ball out of bounds in American football should be a turnover. In other sports like soccer and basketball if a team loses a ball that goes out of bounds the other team receives the ball. In football the team that fumbles receives the ball unless the fumble occurs in the endzone only then it's a turnover. This would make fumbling consistent no matter where it goes out of bounds.,literal

Before being elected the first time Trump claimed he could solve terrorism but didn't want to say how without being elected. He finally caved in an interview and his answer was murder the terrorists' families. Terrorist don't care about themselves but they care about their families. When elected he removed restrictions on drone strikes that avoided killing civilians and stopped reporting when they killed them. and then there's the blowing up suspected drug boats thing. Kill everyone despite no imminent danger. It should be illegal if it isn't but it also shows he'll kill people as a preference not a last resort. MAGA is about protecting MAGA. He only refers to his opponents with extreme terminology so that if he has the opportunity he can declare them terrorists so he can go to town.,figurative
Donating money doesn't make you a good person A lot of time I have seen people defending celebs and influencers by saying They do a lot of charity. I don't think charity makes you a good person.

Secondly If someone is earning 2-3 million a year then donating like 1% of your income to charity doesn't mean shit.,literal

An egg scramble made with omelette ingredients is better than an actual omelette When you make an egg scramble with ingredients of an omelette the filling gets dispersed throughout and the ingredients are evenly distributed throughout the dish during preparation.

Bonus points for cheese lovers in scrambles too because the cheese can melt all throughout the scramble and makes it all that much more delicious.,figurative

Media literacy isn't dead; it was never alive There's this quite clearly uncritically accepted idea that media literacy is dead because people can't parse the media they watch or listen to or read.

He was doing it because Cheney was ex vice president of Haliburton and secured a 36 billion dollar contract out of them it's also quite strange that the Pentagon announced like a week prior to 9/11 that they were in debt something to the tune of 4 trillion dollars and then the part that gets hit just happens to be where the financial records are. There's also ample evidence his administration knew 9/11 would happen and didn't take action. Whether we blame Bush or not his administration was absolutely foul and likely stamped the death of thousands of people.

I'm not talking at all about the past or denying that Dems like Schumer and Biden and Pelosi long overstayed their due and have repeatedly fucked up and disappointed. But the conversation was about what the Dems (any of them) can do moving forward. I'm genuinely asking what Dems can actually do to stop the GOP's agenda now. What exactly are people wanting or expecting? But with regards to this: If the Dems just did X (hold firm on the shutdown not conceding to a handshake deal on extending healthcare subsidies force Mike Johnson to swear in Grijalva before agreeing to end the shutdown force an emergency full funding on SNAP benefits while in shutdown and not accept any concessions until Republicans agree to those terms) then they could stop certain aspects of the GOP's agenda. What would that actually look like? How could the Dems force Johnson and the GOP to make those sizable concessions when those people were perfectly fine continuing the shutdown? Everyone's disappointed with how it ended but I'm not sure how else it would have ended unless we're counting on Republicans to suddenly develop empathy and compassion.,literal

That's a ridiculously huge number but just for the sake of argument all allow it. 100 staff members needed before January is 0.002 percent of the amount of resumes he's received.

None of this screed addresses the notion that Europe is one of the major sources of funding for Russia's war in Ukraine and that they've failed to rise to the threat of Russian revanchism. I wasn't addressing that notion. You wanted me to address that notion because you think you can somehow argue against that with uhm well we technically spend a couple billion more on oil than on Ukranian aid. Checkmate! when that has been frequently explained by the fact that a) purchases of Russian resources have diminished by sometimes as much as 90% compared to pre-war levels and b) the remaining 10% of purchases are only waht is necessary so Europe has the manufacturing capacity to actually continue supporting Ukraine. The remaining 10% are scheduled to run out in 2027 and the only one who will still keep importing is Hungary cause we know Orban sucks Putin's dick. Literally a ton of the support necessary for your statement to work is that yes two countries in Europe are Putin stooges so we know they do and will continue to buy resources. That doesn't invalidate the 90% drop compared to pre-war levels and the complete phase out. You can complain all you want about Trump (and fuck that guy all the way to the sun) but if Europe had been pulling its weight since the beginning of this and actually showed some real goddamn initiative Trump wouldn't matter. We've been consistently supporting Ukraine more than the fucking US throughout mid-2025 to the tune of 10-20% more and the only reason Americans even go back on this shit is because while they deliver weapons directly and inflate the worth of 20 year old equipment we directly pay premium for these weapons. America has taken a rocket worth a million in 1995 slapped a $1 million price tag on it in 2025 and sent it over to Ukraine at a premium while the MIC re-stocks the American capacities. I know it's something Americans don't like to hear but even fucking Biden slow-trickled the aid deliveries and inflated the numbers to give the MIC more profit. You're a polity of 500M people demanding that a nation of 330M people save you from a nation of 120M people I don't demand shit from you.,figurative

This is one of those popular unpopular opinions. Most people don't really care one way or another. If their clothes have brands/logos on them. It's incidental mostly.

Then there's the folks that are the opposite and refuse to buy something with any branding on it....even if it's an otherwise quality product at an otherwise reasonable price.

Not sure where you got any of your information but it's basically all false. AI is so much more than just LLM companies trying to sell you a chat bot.

Like I have mentioned in other replies every single sector is using AI in some way or another right now with huge success. Everything from the hyperscalers and tech giants all the way down to grocery stores and gas stations. HPC has been around for a long time and GPU's were slowly adopted over decades with recent advancements in software exploding the usefulness of CUDA and other similar alternatives.

In my opinion Legolas is the worst part of the Hobbit trilogy. He feels shoehorned in and the editing done to de-age Orlando Bloom is bad at best. Adding him was entirely unnecessary and only took away from the story and added totally unnecessary parts. As others noted they really just added a bunch of stuff so they could make extra movies. All this did was cheapen the story make things more confusing and slow the plot down to a grueling pace,figurative
No he's saying it should be 91/11/5202. The 9 being the smallest unit (days) the first 1 being the next smallest (10's of days) then months then ten's of months etc. still stupid though because that's not how we right numbers,literal

Side punchout cameras are better than middle punchout cameras on phone screens... The middle punchout forces everything downwards while the side punchout allows for notifications and those icon things to be displayed at the top of the screen. No TV show or YT video has important stuff at the top right and left corners. The punchouts block everything and ruin the experience of a phone so much for such a tiny thing. Your screen real estate is effectively lessened.,figurative
Both DD/MM/YYYY and MM/DD/YYYY are equally as bad As a standard both are fine because the local population understand which 2 digits are month and day and it is identical to how the local language orders dates. The argument that DD/MM/YYYY is better because it's from smallest to largest is just wrong. It's actual order is 2nd smallest 1st smallest 4th smallest etc... YYYY/MM/DD is just much better than both.,literal

Do people think Smaug was the example of too much CGI in the Hobbit? That's not my impression. I thought he was seen as one of the best things about it. At least at first before the golden statue stuff. It's characters like Azog as compared to someone like Lurtz where the difference is noticeable in a bad way. Or the goblins vs the Moria orcs. They just look much more fake and the whole direction of the scenes more video gamey with little feeling of danger or tension despite the constant action...,figurative
I think that's up for debate. Again the world is going to eventually tire of giving money/support to Ukraine in a war that doesn't seem to be going anywhere.

In my fairly extensive experience working with lawyers: anything that needs to get done by lower level associates or legal researchers gets done super fast because the whole culture for those folks is working 80 hour weeks to try to get ahead. Anything that needs to get done by older guys and partners takes absolutely forever because they put in their time and are rich and barely do any work anymore. Things like disbarring is a panel of old dudes so yeah good luck getting them to come off the golf course for an hour zoom meeting once a month to talk about it.,literal

It's a moot point. The war can't be ended by getting people into a room and hammering out a compromise. It must be fought until there's a decisive conclusion on the ground. At that time the parties can horse-trade territory or whatever. The only exception--which is likely but undesirable--is for the war to reach a stalemate. In that case it becomes a frozen conflict ala the Korean War. It would be much better for the US and Europe to back Ukraine until the Russians have to quit. That doesn't mean Ukraine gets all of its pre-2014 territory back however. Ukraine giving up weapons is bad not only for Ukraine but also for Europe/NATO. The country has one of the biggest (if not the biggest) military in Europe. NATO and the EU need it.,figurative

Green bean casserole and sweet potato with marshmallows are gross With Thanksgiving approaching small talk often turns to what people are making or looking forward to having on Thanksgiving. These two dishes seem to come up the most. Green beans are one of my favorite vegetables. Fresh ones from the produce section are the best and frozen are fine but they are one of the worst vegetables to can and most recipes call for canned ones. Then they are covered in some cheesy slop and topped with the crunchy onion things...why are we ruining green beans? Just make a side of fresh ones it's a special meal! Sweet potatoes are already sweet! Adding sugary goo on top is just pointless and buries the taste of the potato. I can only conclude that these recipes were created because people hate vegetables.,figurative
Not really the point. Labor is often 70% of the cost and cheapest vendor often leaves a crew idle and you can't find a similar part that will work.

NTA. Sounds like Mom doesn't want to do it Dad and fiancé want the traditional walk and you want something different. It is great to honor both parents to but you need to find a way that makes you Mom comfortable. And if you don't want just your Dad then walk by yourself. That is also an option. And while weddings are something you and your fiancé should plan together I don't think he needs to dictate who walks you down the aisle. That is a special moment for YOU with the person or people of your choosing. It doesn't have anything to do with him.,literal

Edit to add more information on what I mean by significant digit: The more change you get when you modify a digit the greater it's significance. The 1st digit of YYYY is most significant because a change in that is +/- 1000 years (e.g. 2025 > 3025) where as the 2nd digit of DD is the least significant. I guess my unpopular opinion is that digits should be taken into account for a format and neither DD/MM/YYYY and MM/DD/YYYY properly sorts by digits. Typo: meant to say the argument that DD/MM/YYY... So... YDMMYYYD? So today date 19/11/2025 would be 21110259 Or are you really badly arguing for YYYY/MM/DD,literal

Donating money doesn't make you a good person A lot of time I have seen people defending celebs and influencers by saying They do a lot of charity. I don't think charity makes you a good person.

Secondly If someone is earning 2-3 million a year then donating like 1% of your income to charity doesn't mean shit. Not everyone is bad tho. There are genuine good celebs out there but protecting them by saying they so charity is stupid and you should be in jail for being stupid.,literal
