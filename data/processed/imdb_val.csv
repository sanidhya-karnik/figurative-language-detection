"From Great to Good, to decent to AMAZING back to Good... S4 of Stranger things has matured along with the show. It is actually violent, at times genuinely horrifying and fun all at the same time. While some of the acting is minorly subpar, it is met with fantastic acting, brilliant looking shots, awesome makeup and practical effects, a great sound choice for every scene and a convincing bad guy. It deals with the vast amount of characters really well by sectioning them off into 3 different groups which gives us refreshing moments when maybe we spend too much time with a certain group. This season wasn't absolutely perfect, there was very minor things but there isn't quite enough to derail the show. This season (1st volume) is by far the best they have produced. As a season this is easily a 9/10 and a series of an 8/10. As long as they stick the landing and volume 2 lives up to the first, this will easily be a 9/10 series. It's a long watch but I highly recommend it and it is a show I would even recommend getting Netflix for at this point.

Volume 2- Only two episodes but basically a shorter movie and a long movie worth of content. Volume 2 pick up right where volume 1 left... as you would expect. I feel like the new more mature version of Stranger things that volume 1 brought kind of went away mostly. While there's some stuff there, I feel like they loaded this with plot armor and a wanted to make sure of a season 5. It almost feels originally this would be the last season but then volume 2 was their way of ensuring there would be another season. I'm not sure why they chose to shy so far away from the mature side, especially how well it worked in volume 1 but this was a drag at times and underwhelming to say the least. One more season to go, all I can do is hope they listen to the reception with volume 1 and show a pair with their characters for once. I'm so tired of the gotcha's. Volume 2 is a 7/10

Keeping the series at S1- 8/10 S2- 8/10 S3 7/10 S4V1- 9/10 S4V2- 7/10

Series total- 8/10.",literal
"Binge watched the whole series during coronavirus lockdown I watched all eight seasons within a week, and was surprised at how many things I had forgotten, and many other connections to events I never made the first time I watched it. The show holds up very well, and to be honest, watching the ending seems appropriate. Yes, a wildly popular character died (if you consider a death on this show to be a spoiler, you really are a newbie), but to be honest, there were only two possible ways this thing could end: either the Game continues and the death toll mounts, or the Game ends and peace can finally happen. As I get older, I think I like the chosen ending more.",literal
"Time to give it a rest I actually rate this show a 9 until, I don't know, after all the best characters left. In all honesty, I had tired of Stabler and was glad he left. I hated to see Munch leave and also Captain Cragen. I was ecstatic when Kat left. This character was too sympathetic for me and always looked like she was going to cry.

I loved this show. But it has now become boring, repetitious, humdrum. I am all for the advancement of women, especially into normally male dominated fields. However, I really liked Liv best when she was a detective. Her role as captain lacks believability. As a matter of fact, the show has become the Olivia Benson show. I think Noah is cute. However, I'd prefer less of him and more crime. I think too many beloved characters who helped bring reality to the series left, and it has now become a soap opera. It is time to put this series to rest.",literal
"Shockingly bad I'm a big fan of both Ryan Murphy and most of the starring actresses of this show, so I was very much looking forward to it.

It must have been about fifteen minutes into the pilot episode when I started asking myself what this really was, and why it was so bad. I'm actually very surprised by it, having seen most of Murphy's work with great admiration. This was just dissapointing. The storylines and dialogues are sometimes painful to watch, three stars mainly go to Watts, Paulson and Close.",literal
"Suspenseful - great acting.- but wtf !! Why did I vote this so low?

What a great way to present the topic. Multiple viewpoints and stories.

But ....

The characters weren't developed sufficiently, and in a number of cases the roles of people were unbelievable (extremely senior people making inconceivable choices; people who who.are painted as not senior apparently with way too much authority etc).

Story lines were built up then just stopped.

And then the whole thing just stopped . For no reason.

I thoroughly enjoyed it, until the end when it seemed there was going to be explanations for people, their roles, or the actual reason for the movie.

But nope. Nothing.

Was this produced as a pilot for a limited series? Did the director decide to cut half the movie out to allow viewers to build their own opinions about the people, the roles, the story lines?

Whatever the reason, just stopping after two hours was just frustrating.

At least most of the actors did a good job, so this won't adversely affect their careers too much.

But the director/producer .... I hope they find it hard to get funding for their next adventure because of this.",literal
"THE BEST !!!SMALL SPOILER FROM END OF EPISODE ONE!!!

This is my absolute favorite show. I give it a 10/10! I watched this show with my sister and I loved it so much! The way they just made the show makes you feel like you are a part of it. Like when will goes missing you wonder ""what is that!?"" or ""no willllll!"" you just feel like you are a part of the show! But a warning be careful because you will most likely get addicted! There are a bit of jump scares but there's also so many beautiful moments. The episodes are a bit long but it all pays off! Anyways, I totally recommend!",literal
"""Welcome to The Running Man!"" I went into the film without high expectations, but I was curious to see what Edgar Wright would do with the material and how Glen Powell would approach the lead role. The marketing campaign strongly suggested that this would be a tense, action-packed thrill ride, and in hindsight, that does not reflect what the film ultimately delivers.

The opening feels visually interesting and stylistically appealing, but the longer the story unfolds, the less tension and intensity it creates. Even though this adaptation follows the original Stephen King (Richard Bachman) novel far more closely than the 1987 film, it does not result in a more gripping or emotional experience. Instead, the pacing becomes noticeably restrained, and I never felt genuinely drawn into the stakes or pressure of the situation.

Another aspect that stood out to me was the feeling that the movie occasionally looked and functioned like a large-scale product-placement showcase, where visual presentation and style seemed more prominent than narrative weight or urgency, which weakened the immersion at several points.

Glen Powell delivers a solid performance, but without the spark that could carry the film emotionally. What disappointed me even more was that the high-profile supporting cast looks promising on paper but lacks meaningful presence, impact, or influence within the story. Many characters appear as if they were meant to be interesting, yet remain underdeveloped and underutilized. When Powell eventually says, ""I'm still here, ya s*-eaters!""**, it feels like a moment intended to land with force, but the emotional buildup simply wasn't strong enough to make it resonate.

The final showdown also feels far less impactful and memorable than one would expect from a film with this concept. Overall, it isn't a bad movie, but it clearly falls short of its potential, visually appealing, technically competent, but not nearly as intense, thrilling, or satisfying as the premise or marketing suggested.",literal
"Stereotypical and poorly written Some nice acting from the supporting cast although Scarlet didn't add much.

The baddie wasn't really very bad. Just given lots of cliches to spout about money and not caring about people.

SPOILERS COMING... The English guy who liked weapons died quickly - super predictable. Then the black guy who only added some minor comic relief died next - again entirely as predicted.

The dinosaurs weren't amazing or scary. The plot was full of ridiculous holes and the characters were so thin that I just didn't care about any of them. This is despite a few drawn out dialogue scenes to tell cliched back stories to try and force you to care.

The fate of the helicopter was obvious from the moment a helicopter was mentioned.

Seriously very poor. One of the worst in the franchise. Childish writing. I really hope they can get some decent writers in to tell a proper story so this epic franchise doesn't die a slow and painful death.",literal
"Star wars / Avatar had a monster baby. Being a long time fan of the predator films. I never thought I'd see something like this. It has it's moments. The beginning is more predator. Everything after the first 5 min is some weird starwars/avatar stuff. I wasn't a fan of it. The predator design that I hated from the previews grew on me as time went on. I hope there is never another predator film like this. Kind of an ok idea to see one time. But after this, I think it's taking from the greatness that is the predator and what it stands for.",literal
"Good but... So the show is so good actually..but the last three episodes was too focused on glenda cleveland who I wasn't interested about or asking about her...also,her character was so dramatic which I didn't like it and it made me feel like she is pretending in many situations.... I don't know if this because the character is like that in real or it's the actress.thats the only comment for me about what I didn't like in the show but on the other side the show in general was cool...I loved the way of telling the story...I loved the the actors of dahmer and dahmer's dad...I loved photography and directing, which really made me feel like I was in that era.",literal
"brilliant show,superb cast at the top of their game. I d been putting off watching this show,not my cup of tea etc etc,but i m running out of top rated things to watch. I needn t have worried,the morning show is right up there with the best.at first sight the cast may seem to be top heavy with female actors and don t get me wrong,witherspoon and aniston do a great job but the plaudits must go to steve carell,billy crudup and mark duplass.carell and crudup are a joy to watch with the latter showing what a top,top actor he is. The show is laden with things that i hate,the #metoo movement and the over sensitivity of ethnic minorities ,but at least the show does send them up to a certain extent.do yourself a favour and binge watch this gem,you won t regret it.",figurative
Crazy stuff If u value anything that has to do with common sense or logic then please don't watch this movie really bad and the magic tricks it's just like come on that's just madness like the explanation of how they did it makes u rethink why u even clicked on the movie really bad P.s the other ones were good enough but this one was terrible.,literal
"Even Worse Than The First One As a hardcore horror fan, I must say this was a mental torture instead of a paranormal slasher flick. The first one actually gave some scare in its first half but this one is more of an art house student film project with experimental grainy visuals that look like shot by a toaster.

For its first hour we literally just watch a bunch of ghost looking children appearing and harrasing two crazy protagonists from the first film. The second half we finally get some idea of what is the antagonist ""the Grabber"" really wants. Too late...

It is as bad as a sequel can get after the first mediocre establisment.",literal
"Reminiscent of Trading Places I saw Good Fortune, starring Aziz Ansari-Parks and Recreation_tv, This Is the End; Keanu Reeves-the John Wick movies, Speed; Seth Rogen-the Neighbors movies, This Is the End; Keke Palmer-Nope, Scream Queens_tv and Sandra Oh-Killing Eve_tv, Grey's Anatomy_tv.

This is a comedy reminiscent of a 1983 movie called Trading Places-if you are unfamiliar with it, a rich guy and a poor guy switch lives with each other. Aziz wrote, directed and stars in this movie as the struggling down on his luck poor guy that is working several jobs and not getting anywhere. He is even reduced to sleeping in his car. Keke plays a co worker that Aziz likes at one of his jobs. Keanu plays a budget Angel, with his specialty being to watch over people that are texting while driving and he saves Aziz from an accident. Seth plays a rich playboy with the perfect life, that hires Aziz for a trial basis but fires him after a week. Keanu wants to do more in his job and decides to help Aziz see that his life can be as good as anyone elses by switching lives with Seth for a week. Aziz, of course, loves the idea and after a week, does not want to switch back. Sandra plays Keanu's Angel boss that is not happy with Keanu and the mess he has made. FYI: After making all the John Wick and Matrix movies, without hurting himself, Keanu fractured his knee during this film.

It's rated R for language and drug use and has a running time of 1 hour & 37 minutes.

I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD.",literal
"Nothing New to Watch Well, based on the trailer, it looked extremely interesting. But now that I've watched it, I am not satisfied.

The subject matter is extremely boring and cliché. There is nothing special in this film, except for the presence of the male actors. But Ms. Johnson could not deliver the role she was playing. She was too cold and emotionless for this character. Eventhough I said the actors were good, yet they weren't very good. They, too, couldn't awaken the sense of sympathy.

And, I may be wrong, but this film felt a bit misogynistic. It declares that women's priority is money.

And, at the same time, it couldn't convey the cliché message that LOVE prevails all! The chemistry didn't work, and it just wasn't satisfying enough.

I thought they had stopped making these sorts of films!",literal
"Great as usual You cant compare UK version with US version. they are completely different. If you liked the UK Office it doesn't mean you will like the US show. The first season of US version can be compared to the English version because they were trying to use the same formula, but they couldn't do it well enough. From season 2 they reinvented the whole thing and did a completely new show, totally different from the original.

So if you like season 2 of US Office you will like all following seasons just the same. My favorite season is the fourth but that doesn't mean the others are not as good.",literal
"charming, very funny, and distinctive Charming, very funny, and distinctive--cast is incredible, venue is distinct. Not yet another show shot somewhere because of greater tax incentives. The show has heart, insight, originality, and a deep sense of conviction. It isn't trying to be anything other than what it is, a brilliant reimagination of genre fiction set far from Los Angeles or any other ""big cities.""",literal
"Nobody 2 doesn't improve on its predecessor or recapture its novelty, but it's a welcome return to the fun with enough spins on what worked Following the events of the previous film, Hutch Mansell (Bob Odenkirk), his wife Becca (Connie Nielsen), and their two children Brady (Gage Munroe) and Sammy (Paisley Cadorath) have settled into a new suburban neighborhood as Hutch continues his line of work as a government assassin to pay off the massive debt they paid off for the Russian Mafia from Hutch's actions against them. Struggling with burnout from the barrage of assignments and feeling himself drifting from his family, Hutch organizes a family vacation to the resort town of Plummerville where he, his brother Harry (RZA) and father David (Christopher Lloyd) had vacationed some years back. With Hutch, his family, and his father in tow, the group end up at the resort town but following an altercation between the resort owner Wyatt Martin's (John Ortiz) son Max (Lucius Hoyos) and Brady, this leads to an escalating conflict with Sheriff Abel (Colin Hanks) and puts Hutch's vacation on a collision course with the criminal interests the town serves.

Nobody 2 is the sequel to the 2021 film Nobody from 87North Productions which proved to be a modest hit in 2021 as the pandemic began to gradually ease. Development on a sequel began in 2022 with original director Ilya Naishuller preoccupied with Amazons Heads of State leading to Indonesian director Timo Tjahjanto making his English language feature debut having contributed to some international but foreign language productions like segments of of the V/H/S series or the Netlfix originals The Night Comes for Us and The Shadow Strays. Nobody 2 doesn't reinvent or expand the world and concept of its predecessor, but it finds enough new angles to make this a fun and engaging revisit.

As with the original film, Bob Odenkirk is really good as Hutch as not only does he sell his scenes as an overworked and over-stressed family man but also succeeds in the elaborately choreographed and darkly comic action sequences which not only showcase his impressive physicality and coordination, but is also well mixed with his natural comic timing. The movie also gives expanded roles to RZA as Hutch's brother and Christopher Lloyd as Hutch's father while also keeping the quirky aspects of the characters in tact (such as never revealing the backstory behind how Harry and Hutch became brothers). Connie Nielsen is also good in her return as Becca who does serve primarily as a straightman to the chaos following Hutch, but is also more involved particularly in a very fun amusement park set climax. Colin Hanks gives an absolutely scene stealing performance as Sheriff Abel playing against his natural likability to play a backstabbingly loathsome little man who you're glad to see get his comeuppance and Sharon Stone is having a blast as the big bad of the film in a fun scene chewing performance.

The film is structured similarly to its predecessor, but some of the charm of the original definitely came from Odenkirk's unconventional casting that was mixed with the surprising turns taken by the plot in the first act where the inciting incident was largely pointless with the plot literally crashing into hutch. Since this is a sequel, Nobody 2 follows the same structure without capturing the same level of punch, but it does try to find some alternate routes to take with the plot. One of the newer additions is Hutch witnessing some of his fighting instincts manifesting in Brady and there's some good moments pertaining to the nature of fatherhood like where Hutch tells Brady to ""be a better man than me"" or David's moment with Hutch and Harry where he says ""you're both improvements on me"". It's honestly a really good theme of the movie (probably would've made a better Father's Day release than late August but that's just me), just a shame there isn't more of it but it keeps at a quick pace and with the expert choreography of 87North it makes it a fun if slightly disposable sequel.

Nobody 2 is an enjoyable sequel that doesn't up the ante from the first film but revisits it in a new environment covering the same points from a different angle and new location. Maybe a little too reliant on the first film's structure without fully exploring some of its richer aspects, but fun for what it is.",literal
"Jurassic Park needs to go extinct! Had all the usual tropes but nothing new. Mutant Dinosaurs were stupid. Real dinosaurs are way cooler than the stupid ones they invented. The ""big bad"" one at the end is just a giant Star Wars Rancor. Talk about ripping off someone else character design. Spent the whole movie hoping the college aged daughter and her boyfriend would get eaten. I like Scarlett but she's flat in this movie and can't carry all the dead weight. Laughed out loud at a many stupid plot holes and lame setups. Honestly, it's boring. Lots of waiting around for the dinos to attack and when they do it's still boring. One satisfying death was the ""f-16 sized dino"" eating a ""red shirt"" character. The best scene (because its laugh out loud ridiculous) is the ""soy boy"" dino museum scientist crying while he rubs a dinosaur's leg while it's mating. Comedy gold! I'm pretty sure this will be the last Jurassic Park movie... or at least it should be.",literal
Declining as it goes Season 1 and 2 were good but season 3 is a total disastor. Height of stupidities throughout every episode and it climaxes in the last episode where they threaten a drug lord about his family so he can agree to share the codes of the bomb he has planted and about to explode. Can someone ask the director that can't the drug lord have the bombs planted again in order to bargain for his freedom?,literal
"BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL! Glen Powell is a great actor. He does ACTION MOVIES, COMEDIES and ROM-COM all with the same great ability that makes him viewers gold. The action was fresh and not the same old do overs from other movies. Not always predictable but was refreshing. Jayme Lawson was an excellent choice for this movie and brought much to the screen besides her beauty. Josh Brolin was exceptional in every moment he had on the screen. Colman Domingo was great and his acting is great as usual. Katy Bryan is a great character actor and she brought an incredible personality to her role. Too many great performers to name them all but this is a great movie. I liked the ending and I believe the movie was not to be a complete copy of the first movie so for me this movie is a ten.",literal
"good but flawed,Netflix means it is not really a movie Broad plot spoilers.

The film is about a war crisis situation seen from the point of view of US politicians and armed forces members.

I am the sort of person who has long been obsessed by this sort of subject.

Read some books,love the films Dr Strangelove,Fail,Safe,7 Days In May.

This is a Netflix (boo) production that I saw on limited cinema release in the UK.

You can tell it is a cable tv thing because it stops and starts to allow ad breaks.

Subject wise it is not as complex as a proper film to allow youngsters to play with their phones and drink coffee.

The story doesn't advance much because it does the thing where you see the same events from different points of view which I found annoying.

I assume that a lot of research went into making this drama,it explains the many technical terms on scree which I liked.

I hope the drama is not totally realistic because to my British mind their is far too much emotion on show from the people in charge.

I assume that in real life people in command bunkers wouldn't be able or allowed to phone their families and tell them a war was looming.

Surely communications with the outside world would not be allowed?

I know armed forces members are human but would they really get so upset about everything?

Some of the armed forces types in the film are not in uniform and others are,I wonder would they not all be in uniform?

Characters don't seem very confident in the film?

But I must not be too critical it is an interesting film that ends confusingly.

There will be American books but if you like this sort of subject I recommend Beneath The City Streets by Peter Laurie and The Secret State by Peter Hennessy.",literal
"No Kidding, It was Great! Wassup with you guys???? Well, I finally broke down and went to see it.  I was hesitant after reading all the pans here.  Egad!   It was a great movie! You can't compare it to the ""original"" any more  than you can compare ""Scrooge"" to the eternal Dickens classic.  It has a life of its own.  Jim Carrey was amazing.   How he can deliver so many feelings and emotions behind 10 pounds of latex is fantastic.  Some of his scenes (obviously impromptu) were so funny I nearly wet myself.  The sets were great and not nearly as over-blown as I had expected.  As for the  ""prequel"" portion, well, it was only so-so. The best part of the whole show is when they sing the ""Ah hoo torres"" song at the end which has ALWAYS been my most favorite Christmas song ever.

I recommend the movie highly to kids and adults.   As for the negative comments on imdb.com I gotta say...""get over it, ya big bunch of grinches!!!!!""",literal
"Great ""Feel Good"" Movie Although my husband and I are well out of the target demographics for this movie we've enjoyed watching it several times. In fact, we watch it every time we happen to catch it on TV.

It's not a groundbreaking film, but it is a movie that (especially if you, like us, grew up in the 60's) you'll just ""get."" Not only is it well written and entertaining, it brings back memories of a time when all we needed to be entertained was a group of pals, and the long days of Summer vacation.

Good choice to watch with your family or if you are longing a tad for your own childhood.",figurative
"A groundbreaking show The Sopranos did it first; for that alone it deserves to be counted amongst the greatest works of long form fiction of all time. But not only did it do it first, it did it definitively. No TV series I've ever watched has been able to sketch out a story as thematically profound, full of richly crafter characters, violent, tense, and darkly funny as The Sopranos.

Be warned: this is NOT the TV version of GoodFellas. This is not the story of the glamorous and dangerous lives that these gangsters live; on the contrary, it goes out of its way to de-glamorize, strip down, and ground these larger-than-life characters, and then explore their mental labyrinths to determine what makes them the way they are - and most importantly, can they change?

If all of this sounds slow-paced, dialogue-heavy, artsy-fartsy to you, then that's because it very much is. The Sopranos is a show that places heavy emphasis on recurring lines of dialogues, on animal symbolism, on long, extended dream sequences that plumb the darkest depths of these characters' psyches. It practically invented the format that most TV dramas follow, and it actively sought to destroy it. So many times tense situations would simply fizzle out or end anticlimactically that even casual viewers would begin to realize that this show is not about the mob drama at all. Well, in a way it IS about the mob drama, but the mob drama simply forms the stage on which the human drama plays out.

If you've never seen The Sopranos, please do. Apart from one or two scenes (out of a whopping 86 episodes) have aged poorly; the rest of this series is polished to a shine, and if it was made today, it would still outshine all the popular dramas. In other words, it's the GOAT.",figurative
"Hilarious! More please! Smiling Friends is not this deep, intellectual show that every cartoon reviewer on the internet makes it out to be, but it's still really funny. And the characters are incredibly well written. Especially my favorite character Pim. A happy go lucky guy who just wants to put smiles on people's faces (which is the main plot of the show btw). Charlie doesn't share the same level of youthfulness, but he's still committed to his job no matter how bad things get. It's great chemistry.

My favorite episodes are Mr. Frog, the Halloween episode, and the Dungeon's and Dragons episode. I've binged pretty much the entire season and I would love to see more.",literal
"Ratings confusion While 'Freaky Friday' (the original) holds rating of 6.4, the newer movie, 'Freakier Friday,' sits at 7. This is quite surprising, as the original definitely outshines the sequel in many aspects. 'Freakier Friday' is a ok movie, but it doesn't quite reach the charm and depth of the original. It feels more like an average film with both positive and negative points. The original, on the other hand, has a timeless uniqueness that the sequel just can't match. It's puzzling how the ratings don't reflect that!",literal
"Ghosts of the orginal BBC sitcom should haunt the creators of this show Why did they even make this show? There was nothing wrong with the original, Characters of the orginal BBC Ghosts are already very popular. Episodes of both shows have same story, duration and language. Also the original show is not ended yet. Then why? Original BBC ghosts is funny and the characters are very likeable. SKIP IT.",literal
"Without this the arc of the Breaking Bad universe is incomplete A worthy successor of the series 'Breaking Bad' which is so much more than just a spin-off but a thematic conclusion of the story the principal creators behind these works wanted to tell. The circle comes to its full closure with the titular character Saul who (in the end) faces what Walter White never could and reveals himself as central pillar of storytelling of the moral questions raised in the first of this tandem. You absolutely can give this series a shot after 'Breaking Bad' if you are keen on a deepening of the philosophical and moral questions which give the first installment its weight.

All of this is achieved with even more character - and subtle psychological writing compared to 'Breaking Bad' and less action driven grandiosity of plot and firerworks of adrenalin. If you are a fan of psychological tension this will feel even better than its predecessor; if you should by any means rely on action for a good experience you probably will find comparably less in this second chapter. But, many technical aspects of film-making have been improved and the team behind the scenes has not slowed down but indeed has some of its greater moments in 'Better Call Saul' whilst 'Breaking Bad' has the tighter overall narrative and depiction of moral depravity.

A highlight, for me at least, is Lalo Salamanca and the action he brings to the later seasons as well as his chilling performance of a smiling sympathetic guy who is an absolute malignant psychopath which culminates in a harrowing shock of tragedy.",literal
"House 2.0 - The Reboot On one hand, this isn't bad. But, on the other hand, I'm not necessarily impressed. I only gave it four stars because although it is a good show, it is only average, hence five stars. Since it isn't really breaking new ground, it loses a star, down to four. So much of this show was ripped straight from House that if I didn't know any better, I'd think I was watching an actual reboot or a some sort of sequel to House. The only thing this show has to do with Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, wait, I mean Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson are the names of the main character and his best friend. They could've just as well have called this Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and named the characters as such without it changing much the plot or the storyline. There is one of two reasons why they title the show and the characters as they did. One, this is from the same producers as House and they didn't want to have an actual reboot. Don't want to risk following House with a mediocre reboot. Or, two, they couldn't get the green light for a House reboot so they simply changed the name of the show and the main character and hope that no one will notice.",literal
"A lot of bad, but a lot of good too (like this take on Hell and Heaven) As someone who also waited after the pilot release and kept up with the other YouTube show, Helluva Boss, I have some mixed feelings with the first four newly-released episodes.

At first, I was very disappointed. The pacing was AWFUL. The animation was too chaotic to keep up with. I wasn't sure with some voice acting (thankfully NOT with Charlie, the main character). Not to mention, while I understood that they were trying to portray how demons aren't all bad and angels aren't all good, watching Adam in the first episode was a tough pill to swallow.

But, as a loyal fan, I decided to watch the other three relased episodes. Thankfully, continuing on quickly changed my disappointment into satisfaction.

The second episode got into some more world building and side character development, making more intrigued. (I was TERRIFIED during one of the songs, but in a good way)

The third episode showed even more characters with ra particular meeting I was not expecting to see, which was a delight to watch through. Although, I will admit here, the pacing still wasn't great.

But the FOURTH episode is my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE. It was so intense that while my partner and I made comments through the other three episodes, we were mostly quiet throughout this one. They went deep into one of the characters, and yet ending on a fun, (of course crude but still) heartwarming note. Without going into detail, it made me feel not so alone while feeling okay admitting to being a mess. Not to mention, while I had doubts with the voice acting at first, I understood the direction they went by this point and actually appreciated it.

So is this show perfect so far? Absolutely not. There's too many (albeit, mostly decent) songs, and the pacing isn't great. I can understand if people wouldn't want to continue after the first episode as that is supposed to be the show's hook, and it's not good to admit that the first episode was my least favorite so far.

If, however, you were a fan of the pilot/other show like me, I ask you give it a chance. At the end of the day, I can see the heart and soul put into this, and I love that while it's intended for mature audiences, they still give a little of a childish side too, which is something I feel most adult animations lack.

(Just because I say that it can seem childish, doesn't mean I encourage children to watch. There really are some mature themes throughout the show, even for younger teens.)",literal
"excellent film. Let me just say it straight: the beginning of this film was absolutely brilliant. No joke. From the very first scene, I was fully in. The way it was shot, the mood, the pacing - it all hit hard. You could tell the filmmakers knew exactly what they were doing. Everything looked and sounded top-tier. It had that high-quality feel you only get when people really care about what they're making.

The intro pulled me in fast. I didn't even check my phone once, which says a lot. The atmosphere was intense, and every scene felt like it mattered. The camera work was clean, the lighting was on point, and the sound design added a ton of tension. It honestly felt like a masterclass in how to start a movie right.

The way they built everything up was impressive. There was a solid rhythm to how the story moved, and you could tell a lot of time and thought went into the setup. The characters were introduced smoothly, and the world they created felt real and believable. I was fully locked in.

But then it hit a wall.

About two-thirds into the movie, things started to slip. And by the time the ending rolled around, it was clear: they had either run out of time, budget, or energy - maybe all three. The final act felt completely rushed. It was like they just wanted to wrap things up as fast as possible. There was barely any payoff for all the buildup we got earlier. Big questions were left unanswered, and moments that should've hit hard just kind of... didn't.

The ending felt lazy. Not in a ""we didn't care at all"" way, but more like ""we didn't plan this part out properly."" You could see the difference in effort. The quality dropped, the pacing sped up too much, and characters that had been developed early on were suddenly just background noise. It honestly felt like a different movie by the time it ended - and not in a good way.

It's frustrating, because the film had the potential to be great. The opening made me think I was watching one of the best films of the year. But a great start doesn't matter if you don't finish strong. And this film didn't. It faded out instead of going out with impact.

That said, I'm not saying don't watch it. There's still a lot to like here - especially the first half. If you're into movies with strong direction, nice visuals, and a gripping start, you'll probably enjoy most of it. But if you're the type who needs a solid, satisfying ending to feel like it was worth your time, this one might leave you disappointed.

Bottom line: amazing start, weak finish. A film that grabs your attention early, but lets go too soon. It deserved better. I'd give it a 7 or maybe a 8 out of 10, mostly because of how strong the first half is. But yeah - if they had nailed the ending, we'd be talking 9 or even 9.5 easily.",figurative
"A Masterpiece Series This is an amazing piece of work in every way. Often you are laughing but sometime holding back a tear at other times. Its about the forgotten in society and the the vital life experience they have to share with people who care enough to know. The premise of the show is very fun and the writing creative but always staying on pitch with real human life.

Cheers to the cast who did such a marvelous job playing characters that the viewer can identify with emotionally. I hope there is another season because this series can go to so many places in the souls of the audience, good places, maybe at times hard places, but wonderful real human need places.",figurative
"What went wrong The first half of this show was very intriguing I really enjoyed it,it was skin crawling creepy and had me looking away from the tv in some parts as it portrayed dahmer for the sick twisted individual he was,evans did a good job playing dahmer and his father in the series also played a great part with great acting but then the second half of the story turns into typical Netflix political agendas,racism and police corruption is the topic of the final 4 episodes of this series which really spoils the show and I struggled to finish it off.why must shows have to tread this line is beyond me there was no interactions with the families of the white men damher killed and the show just made it out that everyone white was racist even the serial killer 🙄 Netflix should of just made season 3 of mindhunter I'm honest a great show they killed off just when it had us all on the edge of our seats.",literal
"Mediocre Scriptwriting and Directing Given the richness and quality of the original source material, this series had the potential to be a masterpiece with more talented scriptwriters and directors. However, it currently feels like a standard TV show lacking any real spark or maturity, relying instead on maintaining the audience's interest with short and scary 'hook' scenes. In my opinion, they should have hired Stephen King as the creative chief supervisor for the scripts and Cary Fukunaga-renowned for his masterful direction of True Detective-as both director and scriptwriter. Had they done so, we would be discussing a very different series today. Andy Muschietti is a decent director, but unfortunately, he lacks the talent to do justice to the source material and elevate this series to something exceptional. This third episode also demonstrates that the series is not only inspired by the novel but is also heavily influenced by Muschietti's *It* movies. Unfortunately, the *It* movies have their own flaws, such as overused, low-quality CGI, uneven pacing, and episodic and scattered plotting, and these issues have been carried over into the series. So far, the series is not bad, but it remains unsatisfying, disappointing, and a missed opportunity for me.",figurative
"Good story but Danes acting is awful It would have been great, but Danes was a poor choice for this role. Her acting is so over the top, it's difficult to watch.

"Getting better by the second! I really wasn't sure what to expect when I began the first episode but it became clear by the end I was going to be thoroughly intrigued to find out and haven't been disappointed! With some classic mob story line, brilliantly placed humor and building suspense now three episodes in i'm completely hooked to see where this ride takes me. Stallone uses his now well honed talents to bring an aging removed gangster persona to life in a way I didn't expect. The supporting cast adds flavor in so many different ways with a vast sea of storylines that add to overall plot of the show. I hope writers don't lose sight of the masterpiece they are unfolding here because for the first time in a long long time, Tulsa King shows promise of being absolutely epic on many many levels.",figurative
"It's bonkers and stupid and defies logic and it's gloriously good fun! The main character has a tremendous amount of plot armour but it doesn't matter, this is killing nazis with glee. It's enormously good fun.

The nazis are straight out of central casting, the story is very simple and easy to follow, there's mild exposition, there's zero attempt at being intellectual or explaining character motivations, it's more like a live action graphic novel with incredibly gory violence.

On this point, 1 word of warning: There is a really horrible scene with a horse. If you're an animal lover, skip this bit.

The bulk of the film is in English, with the movie switching entirely to Finnish at the end but perhaps for only 3 or 4 lines.

It's worth a watch, definitely not family entertainment but 1 of those films you can just chuck on when you want to be entertained and aren't looking for anything too deep.

Characters are on point. They really are like characters from the games, Lucy, the Ghoul and multiple others especially. And for that to be possible, casting had to be on point too.

Great performances running throughout, with a nearly unmatched fast pace that leaves you no time to pause, something I find lacking in so much TV of today. Walton Goggins is as usual excellent, a layered and confident performance. The set dressing, locations and costume work are all superb, worn out, destroyed and strikingly impressive. Worth a watch for anyone who enjoyed the high energy and violence of 1980s sci-fi, great fun!",literal

"Is TV funny again? After a few years of sere, message-driven, and frankly unentertaining sanitized TV on the major network and streaming platforms, we're seeing a return to both irreverent comedy and engaging drama/action original programming.

There was a time when most HBO (going back 25 years) original content was better than broadcast TV and on par with good books and movies as entertainment choices.

Since about 2015, really, entertainers and show-runners feared social repercussions to the point of reigning in creative talent and producing ""safe"" material. Which also wasn't very entertaining.

The comment ""you couldn't make that film or show today"" referring to hits from maybe 15-20 years ago really shouldn't be part of the creative process.

Robinson's self-deprecatory, surrealist, comedy of errors style humor managed to also thrive during this more heavily self-censored era. Importantly, Robinson's casting and skits are inclusive. It's inclusive not only in its casting diversity but in the regard that everyone gets a chance to be just as ridiculous as and land as many laughs as Tim.

The fact that The Chair Company at times pushes the envelop of appropriateness should be applauded rather than chastised.",literal
"finally a descent movie in 2025 I want to start out by saying Reeves is adorable as gabriele. After his hardman wick character. Reeves completely switches roles and he does a wonderful job.

I have always liked rogan. But he pretty much portraise the same character in recent movies.

Ansari, being a comedian was humorous. But any well known indian actor could have played arj. I guess he didn't make the character his own.

There is a heavy underlining theme that the wealthy get richer off the backs of the working class. But thats capitalism for you. The story does stress, you work hard and you will eventually see the benefits. No one is going to hand you your silver spoon.

The storyline was very engaging and hour and a half went quicky. Although the actual story line doesn't start till 20 minutes in. They managed to tie everything together with a poignant ending.

The casting was strong with lots of good performances. But i think reeves carried the movie along himself.

I was just nice to see something different from the usual drivel being produced.",literal
"Hazbin Hotel stands out as one of the most unique anime series I've seen in a long time I recently watched the anime series Hazbin Hotel (2019) on Prime. The plot centers around the Princess of Hell, who endeavors to establish a rehabilitation center to help demons rehabilitate their way to Heaven. Despite facing skepticism in Hell, she receives support from her hotel's bartender, a porn star, her lover ""Vaggie,"" and a deity. However, doubts arise about whether Heaven would ever take her efforts seriously, even if successful.

Created by Vivienne Medrano (Helluva Boss), the series features the voices of Erika Henningsen (Blue Bloods), Stephanie Beatriz (Encanto), Keith David (They Live), Daphne Rubin-Vega (In the Heights), and Blake Roman (Blue Bloods).

Hazbin Hotel stands out as one of the most unique anime series I've seen in a long time. Its premise, while seemingly wholesome, is infused with sex jokes, gory murders, random violence, and depictions of drinking and drug use. While the storyline itself is decent, it's the chaotic backdrop of Hell that truly captivates. Each segment concludes with a song, varying in quality, though Keith David's performances stand out. The series culminates in an exceptional final fight and resolution.

In conclusion, Hazbin Hotel offers an entertaining glimpse into the universe of Hell. I would rate it 7/10 and recommend it to anyone seeking something out of the ordinary.",literal
"Unfortunate in a number of ways Overall, this had a lot of potential. Loved the amount of representation and it was done SO WELL, and Toni Colette is incredible as always.

Unfortunately, the ending is incredibly lackluster and we're forced to endure some incredibly awful acting and writing throughout. Mae Martin is great on Taskmaster, but should not be in this type of leading role (their acting is so bad it's distracting). The Pigeon is another standout: distracting in how bad their acting is. Plot holes a plenty, and the teens are written as though a baby boomer was tasked with doing the screenplay.

Lastly: Abby's parents and home situation was laughably dumb. You want us to believe that a family living in Toronto has guests over where their daughter plays piano and they mock and laugh at their other daughter while serving brie? So so dumb...",figurative
"Trier's magnum opus Sentimental Value is hands-down the best movie of the year and my personal favorite for best picture at the Oscars (sorry, not sorry, One Battle After Another!).

With Sentimental Value, Joachim Trier creates what could be his magnum opus. If not that, the movie will at least become a classic and one of his best works. It is released three years after The Worst Person in the World and stars Renate Reinsve, who once again plays a very similar role of a complex character with conflicting traits and many issues (in terms of her psyche, life, and relationships).

For these reasons, it might be inevitable to compare the two movies. On the one hand, we will notice that The Worst Person in the World has a greater complexity and a deeper exploration of Julie's life and character. It explores themes of depression, anxiety, purpose, identity, meaning, and ambition. It examines the complexities of relationships and how they often conflict with the modern lifestyle and careerism. The movie achieves greatness in its intimate and personal exploration of the main character-something rare to find in cinema and that could never work unless there is a perfect combination of a great and talented actor, a brilliant writing team, and a director with vision.

Sentimental Value, on the other hand, might seem less successful and ambitious in terms of being a character study and telling a very personal story. But once the credits start rolling, you can't help but admit that it is no less personal and intimate a movie. This time around, the intimacy is not limited to just one character.

There are certain moments throughout the movie when you might feel lost as to who the main character is and whose life and psyche we are exploring. However, in one memorable scene, we receive the answer to this question, and everything comes into place before the conclusion. In that scene, we see a shot of Stellan Skarsgård in a pitch black space, with soft light illuminating his face and casting shadows; in a very Trier-esque style blending reality and dream by blurring the lines between the two, his face starts shifting to the face of his daughter Nora, then his other daughter Agnes, then the actress Rachel, then back to him again, repeating the cycle. We no longer see the individual faces because their lines blend perfectly and flow into each other as if they are slowly becoming one.

That's the clue to the movie. It is a family story that understands and acknowledges the complexities of the family as an institution, as a union, as one whole, and as a sum of individual parts that are a whole world by themselves. When we finally see that the movie isn't about Nora and her struggles, nor about her father Gustav, who faces a late-life crisis and tries to come to terms with his family and redeem himself, we see the bigger picture and the web of connections between father, mother, wife, husband, grandparents, daughters, sisters, and even grandchildren. Each person plays their own part in the whole and contributes in their own way to help maintain a healthy core and a happy home.

But families are never plain and simple, and Trier and Eskil Vogt understand that. They explore how generational trauma sends out ripples across time and impacts everyone's life. Nazi history is a big issue for Europe, and here, we can clearly see how long after the end of WWII we are still trying to free ourselves of its damage. Sissel, the mother of Nora and Agnes, has suffered at the hands of the pro-Nazi government. After they let her go, she was never herself again. She never recovered from that trauma, and the damage she suffered was transferred to her daughter(s). Recovering from the past proves to be a lifetime's work of inner growth, acceptance, and deep care, tenderness, and support from your family.

The beauty of the movie lies in Trier's masterful portrayal of how, despite each character's individual troubles, it is only through their togetherness and mutual love that they can heal one another. No one can make it on their own-family is the only thing you can ever count on. Even lovers-as is the case with Jakob, Nora's colleague and romantic interest-are unreliable and never become a constant anchor.

Elle Fanning plays a crucial role as Rachel Kemp, who serves as a foil to the characters and is a stimulus for both the plot to move forward and the characters to come to terms with themselves. Gustav can't really talk with his daughter as they are estranged and there is a thick wall between them. But Rachel's naivety, curiosity, and inherent goodness allow him to open up and to say and understand things he wouldn't otherwise.

However, no matter how helpful she proves to be to the father and daughter, she remains a stark contrast to their world. As an American actress, everything about her is different-from her accent to her outfits. She is an outside addition. She feels out of place and slowly comes to realize that the role she has to play in Gustav's movie was never meant for her. She is just a temporary character in someone else's story, and that's ok because Trier succeeds where many others fail. Together with Vogt, they craft a complete story arc for her character and create a real human being, rather than a flat name played by an actor. She isn't just a plot device but someone who adds complexity and richness to the movie and its themes.

In addition to all that, the movie doesn't shy away from exploring the uneasy tension between artistic expression and personal connection. At its core, Sentimental Value is a movie about making a movie. It criticizes the modern industry (I'm looking at you, Netflix!), portrays the struggles of both actors and directors, delves into their personal lives and relationships with their profession, and masterfully blurs the lines between real life and art. In one scene, we see Nora leaving a dinner at her sister's with a troubled mind, and in the next shot, we see her entering a room and bursting into tears, slipping from the bed to the floor. It is a very intimate moment, but as the camera moves away, we see that she is on the stage of a theater, playing a role in front of an audience.

Let's not forget that short gag targeted at cinephiles! It was the best laughter the audience had ever heard. I haven't heard anyone laugh so much in a theater before.

The ending serves as the definitive blending of real life with movie reality. It allows the story, its characters, and even us, the viewers, to come to terms with the difference between the two worlds, learn how to accept ourselves, and finally heal.

None of this would have worked if it weren't for three things.

First, it's the beautiful mise-en-scène and cinematography that capture the personal beauty of the house as the intimate home of the main characters, as well as the universal beauty of Oslo as their home in the wider world and the arena of their external and interpersonal struggles.

Second, it's the beautiful writing and the dialogue. Several lines are just perfect and allow us to feel and understand the characters much better than any action would have. ""It's hard to love someone so full of rage"".

And lastly, it's the Oscar-worthy acting of the stellar cast. Stellan Skarsgård and Renate Reinsve masterfully capture the complexity and dynamics of their characters, while conveying the emotional core of the story in every scene. In the supporting roles, Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas adds crucial depth and contrast to her on-screen sister by enriching her character. In contrast, Elle Fanning conveys the contrast mentioned above and external presence that stirs the waters and helps change others in a very personal way.",figurative
"Mixed performances My wife and I started to feel the original series ""NCIS"" was getting a little bit silly at times, but we still watched it, when there was absolutely nothing else to do. When ""Origins"" came out, we were skeptical, but willing to try. And we greatly prefer this series over what has become of the original NCIS. There are moments of comic relief, but the show as a whole has a much more serious, dramatic feel.

Now the actors- Austin Stowells as Jethro is not great. There's just something off about the guy's timing. Kyle Schmid is doing his damnedest as Mike Franks but the Franks character doesn't always make sense. He's angry at everything, and there's no explanation why. He winds up being annoying 90% of the time.

The strength in the cast, in our opinion, is Mariel Molino as Dominguez (thumbs WAY up) and Tyla Abercrumbie as Sullivan. Solid performances as characters that add value to the show. And the comical guy on the team is Caleb Foote as Randolph. He's no DiNozzo, but we really like him.",figurative

"Perfect family drama Gilmore girl is one of my favorite show on Netflix. I didn't expect it to be really good because when I read an outline it was said 'A story between early 30 single-mother Lorelai and her 16 year olds daughter Rory ' which isn't related to my experience but after watching i realize the plot isn't focus only that, there are family relationship,friends,school,boyfriends and relationship of people in community.

Personally, I like watching old movies to see life at that time, technology, fashion. Although this show aired in 2000 before I was born but I can enjoy the story because I think it is easy to understand, dramas in this show still happen nowadays and I can feel so connected to everything. It's never get old.

I think this show is great with interesting dialogue, film tone,music and gorgeous acting .I can't stop watching it and don't want it to be end. Location is in small town called ""Star hallow"". I love the way they set small town like everyone is family and there are many scenes about town activities such as Town meeting, Dance contest, Christmas and outdoor movie. Soundtracks are great and suit for scenes to build our emotion. Film tone is like pastel color which look dreamy. The way camera follows them when they're moving is smooth.

I suggest parents to watch this show with their teenager sons/daughters to understand that if they act to them like friends, understand their emotions and their minds, support them in every paths they choose your families will be closed and happy. Actors and actress are great performance. Every roles have their obvious characters. My favorite character is Emily( Lorelai's wealthy mother) she acts like she doesn't get along with her daughter because she used to disappointed on Lorelai when she got pregnant at 16 but she always worried and find many activities to do with her daughter.

I will give 8/10 to this show because it represent asian characters and asian family to be strict in the show and there is a scene about cheating on boyfriend/girlfriend which is not good. I wish there will be a family show like this in the future.",literal
"Stranger Things Netflix does it again! I'll admit, I was excited for this show just based on the genre it was listed as being in and so far it has not disappointed. With the exception of a few of the adults most of the cast was unknown to me which only adds to the level of immersion the show can reach. The two performers I was familiar with, Winona Ryder and David Harbour are both magnificent. A few things about Stranger Things are extraordinary and could only be done by Netflix. One, this show is suspenseful and engaging so waiting for a week to see the next episode would change the entire dynamic and would really be a bummer, Stranger Things must be binged! Second, the creators of this series are, like the young actors, unknown to me. Matt and Ross Duffer. Brothers that through conventional methods may not have had the opportunity to bring this show to life, get that opportunity from Netflix. In the past few years television has changed wildly. If you were a writer or actor five years ago you would much rather be a movie star than a television star, those distinctions have all but vanished. This change was brought on by many factors but I'd like to take this opportunity to applaud Netflix for their role. It is no coincidence that they started doing their own programming right around the same time these changes began. Bravo and please start filming season two of Stranger Things ASAP!",literal
"This is a great show! I really love this show. I have always been interested in criminal psychology, and after going to school for a degree in Criminal Justice, someone (my professor) told me that this show was starting up and to watch it.

"A challenge to Bond? Don't make me laugh xXx was an bad movie. It was marketed as the new Bond, having biggest action and hero people could relate to. After a sequel that dive-bombed at the box office and the Bond franchise better then ever the xXx movies are now dead in the water.

The plot of the movie was weak, Xavder Cage (Vin Diesel), was an illegal extreme sports star ends up getting recruited into the NSA headed by Samuel L. Jackson. After a bit of training, including being sent to Colombia to avoid capture by Drug Barons. He is then sent to Prague to investigate Anarchy 99. Anarchy 99 aim is world domination and planned to use chemical weapons to destroy the world's major cities. The dialogue of the film was bad and there is no subtly. It is just a show of explosions and shooting battles where the bad guys can't seem to shot straight. It isn't even trying to be comedic which at least True Lies try to do (I'm not a fan of that film either). It seem to be an attack on Bond type films, but it didn't work. It was just aimed at 14-year-old boys and having extreme stunts and unrealistic events such as riding on a mission in the middle of the river Vltava. This sort of film would have had a short shelve life and will not last. It could not build a franchise and most people would outgrow this sort of movie.

I remember when it was released that there was some talk that Vin Diesel was considered to be a potential Bond, and I was thinking what the hell are you one. Die Another Day tried to be more action based and be more unbelievable. The director of that film, Lee Tamahori, ended up directing the sequel. The real threat to Bond and forcing it to change was not this rubbish but the Bourne Trilogy.

Its just not worth watching this film.",literal
"A Textbook Case of Strengths and Flaws The series is both good and bad. The high rating is primarily for its execution. The actors, cinematography, music, editing, and dialogue are an absolute delight. The flaws, however, become apparent when you scrutinize the plot's nuances and twists.

It feels as if the filmmakers were adamant about squeezing the story into the ""Hays Code"" template: every evil is punished, and being good is, God forgive me, a virtue. If it weren't for this clumsily contrived drive to force a feel-good ending, the series could have been a brilliant illustration of two human conditions. The first: the profound stupidity, irresponsibility, and audacity of some people. The second: a dumb, foolish, and misplaced hope that forgives everything.

That said, it's worth noting that the flaws of this plot, or rather its conclusion, can easily be ignored for one compelling reason: people are indeed always capable of acting foolishly. That's one thing you can't take away from them.",literal

Really just wanted to write a review for the first time to say I've been using imdb ratings and reviews to judge whether or not I want to watch something forever. All these whining conservatives are really making me dread what I used to enjoy. A couple scenes about US history and people refuse to watch and give bad ratings? Dont know if what she said is exactly true. Don't really care. But how do these people think the country was built? What's wrong with saying yeah the country and powers that be do messed up stuff sometimes but I'm still glad I live here. This weird binary good or bad, this or that thinking is dumb and lazy.

"Still as much fun I remember renting 'National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation' from a video store back in the late eighties and again in the early nineties (until I figured it was simply more convenient and cost effective to buy a VHS copy and watch it whenever I want). I was young at the time and clearly loved its slightly dumb, cheesy humour (plus I was a fan of the two previous 'Vacation' films, but you don't actually have to have watched either of those to watch this one - you'll just not be one of us who get confused at the repeated new casting of the kids, Audrey and Rusty). However, for some reason, the film didn't survive my eventual binning of my tapes and buying everything again on DVD. Therefore, I was delighted when a popular online streaming service put it on their schedule in time for the festive season.

It was only now did I realise how much I must have watched it back when I was young, as I knew the script practically word for word. So, in short, I still loved it and was in nostalgia heaven. And I could almost leave the review there if it wasn't for the fact that I was watching it now with my girlfriend who had never seen it before in her life. She hated it.

Therefore, I was sort of forced to re-evaluate it and, although I maintain my love for it, try to see what some people may find wrong with it. Yes, the jokes are dumb. It's sort of like the 'American Pie' of its generation. It's definitely not high-brown entertainment and you have to accept that you're going to be watching a buffoon at work when it comes to the central character, played by Chevy Chase, Clark Griswold. I guess it could be said that some people may simply find him too annoying and stupid to root for.

I suppose a few of the gags do fall a little flat and just as many are predictable, but then by now most adults will have seen so many comedy films by now that they can see 'old humour' coming a mile off. There was actually more profanity in this than I remember, including one 'F-bomb' which does mean that the film may be more unsuitable for 'all' the family than I remember.

I suppose it's quite tame and, because of its age, has a feeling of being done before. However, I still maintain that, overall, it's stood the test of time reasonably well and should still pick up a few new fans here and there (especially in terms of good/funny Christmas movies). You'll definitely get more out of it if, like me, you have nostalgia on your side, but even my girlfriend had to admit that Randy Quaid was a joy to watch. Although, she still maintained that the (seldom-used) neighbours got all of the best gags!

On a personal note, Pittsburgh has become a second home to me over the past couple of years, so I'm especially excited about that connection. The show captures the unique vibe of Yinzers so well. However, even if it were set in another city, I'd still be hooked!

This show is truly incredible. MORE, MORE, MORE, please and thank you!",literal
"Surprise ! This is the surprise hit of the 2021 television season. Cleverly written and wonderfully acted, with interesting sets and locales and very fine direction and editing.

It won't win (let alone be nominated) for any awards, but it should be.

An unusual premise for a comedy series that works brilliantly. Rose McIver and Utkarsh Ambudker are delightful as a couple who discover that the house she inherited (and wants to turn into a BNB) is haunted by ghosts from differing eras.

Check out the episode ""Alberta's Fan"" for just how good this show is. All of the actors playing the ghosts are excellent, but this episode highlights the 5 best : Devan Long as Thorfinn, Richie Moriarty as Pete, Brandon Scott Jones as Isaac, Rebecca Wisocky as Hetty, and the wonderful Danielle Pinnock as Alberta. They are a real hoot in this episode, especially Pinnock, and it exemplifies the personalities of these ""ghostly"" characters. There's also a hilarious turn by Rodrigo Fernandez-Stoll as Todd, who is inadvertently the first guest at the BNB.

How did the producers assemble this excellent cast who so quickly adapted to their characters and demonstrate each week their obvious love for the parts they are playing ? It's a wonder, but congratulations to them.

This is the best new series in quite awhile - on cable, network, streaming, or anywhere.",literal
"Absolute rubbish This is SO badly written and directed that I created an account so I could give it a rating. Why is this otherwise scoring well?!?!

The plot disappears after a few episodes and each new episode is a deep dive into obviousness and overacting.

If you're in the middle somewhere you'll be asking what happened to the kidnapper and the kid?",literal
"Series 1-3 flawless, 4 onwards go downhill Watching the whole thing again front to back, series 4 on seems to start to wander a little. Series 5 can, at times, be simply dull. Series 6: what is that about? It's like all the back stories they realised they hadn't done needed to be told, and episodes with main stories that have no reason to be there. Series 6 is actually a different show. It's direction and pace are fundamentally off. It has the sense of trying to squeeze stuff in, but then not bothering with editing it down. It seems indulgent.

In my head I loved the sopranos. But it doesn't quite stand up to its memory.",literal
"Best 2024 comedy drama show! Thoughtful, heartfelt, with sophisticated and introspective writing that introduces a humor teaming with the awe of humanity and upholding the mysteries and the truths buried at the center of every human soul. Think ""Cheers,"" but set in an assisted living community, A Man on The inside weaves together a complex potpourri of characters and storytelling that reflect real life in much of the same way that a small, unbeknownst fictional bar set the middle of big city Boston did in the 1980s and early-1990s. And with Ted Danson as one of the central characters, a certain nostalgia of that era tugs at the heartstrings. Definitely worth the watch.",figurative
"Not award winning, but still worth the watch.... 7.7/10 (Recommend)

First reaction is that this movie deserves to be commended on more than saying the acting was good, the story was heavy, and the pacing was decent. All three of these things ring true, but it was also more than that. It was thought provoking in its humanity, morality, and legality.

So here is my checklist of this film:


* The acting was good, but I don't think any of it was award winning. The variety of actors chosen for each role made everything feel genuine for the era. Most impressive was Russell Crowe actually speaking German. I assumed it would be him speaking English the entire time, but with a German accent. Beyond the acting feeling authentic the sets felt real too. There wasn't just a ton of close-up shots trying to convince you that you were in war torn Germany. They gave you brief avenues to truly see.



* The story was heavy. You know why they're in Nuremberg, and you know the atrocities that took place. But you know when you don't hear a single crunching of popcorn or rustling of snacks, and there's a collective holding of breath, then you know the director has reeled you in. (Humanity) Emotionally it was more pain and hurt seeing the atrocities and not just tear jerking.



* The pacing was good. Despite its 2.5 hour runtime, the pacing was enjoyable. There's very few moments of down time. I would recommend not going to see the film if you've either been sitting all day, or are tired, or both. I was restless throughout because of both of those things.



* The legality and morality of Nuremberg was not something I ever really considered before. These trials were unprecedented and so the cases had to be built from the ground up. It only shows a partiality of this, but it goes just deep enough to give you a sense.


Overall, this is a movie I'd recommend seeing in theatres. The sound quality is spectacular and the visuals are great on the big screen. This isn't an award winning film by any stretch of the imagination, but it does its job well enough to say ""these were some of the first men to be tried in Nuremberg. We try to humanize them, but in the end they are evil."" It might be long for some, but for others it's good entertainment and possibly the beginning of a knowledge quest.

That's it for now. Thanks for taking time to read my review. Happy watching and enjoy the show!",literal
"Hilarious! Loved it Good family movie, me and my teenage boys loved it! It's been a while since we watched a good action comedy movie. I understand there are some parts where it comes off as goofy or weird, but what's important is that we found it interesting and laughed our asses off! Love the 2 main actors. Highly recommend for a light movie night with a good laugh.",literal
"A Triumph of Heart That Stumbles At the Climax Wicked Part 2: Wicked For Good delivers a visually stunning, emotionally charged continuation of the story, and for most of its runtime it genuinely soars. The film builds beautifully on Elphaba's journey, deepening her moral complexity and highlighting the tragedy of a world determined to misunderstand her. Some of the strongest moments come from her attempts to rally the Animals to rise up against Oz's cruelty - scenes that showcase her compassion, her fire, and the bravery that has always defined her. The movie also sharpens Oz's own villainy, especially in the devastating realisation that he believes he has killed his daughter; it's a moment that reframes his bluster as something far darker and more pathetic. Glinda's arc feels especially satisfying, too. Seeing her come full-circle and finally push back - setting the flying monkeys on Madame Morrible, refusing to be complicit any longer, and later disguising herself to confront Elphaba in the ruins of Kiamo Ko - gives her character a depth and conviction the first part only hinted at.

But for all the film gets right emotionally and thematically, the ending leaves a lot to be desired. Elphaba's planned sacrifice - her decision to let Dorothy kill her in order to expose the corruption of Oz and give the citizens a symbol - is powerful, tragic, and completely fitting for the character we've come to know. She has always been someone who chooses the hard path, the righteous path, even when it destroys her. So when the story reveals that she survived the water and simply escaped, it undercuts the very weight the narrative spent two films building. Elphaba has always been a complexly beautiful character shaped by loss, injustice, and resilience, and watching her make the ultimate sacrifice should have been the emotional peak. Instead, the twist that she lives lands like a cheap reversal - less a triumph and more a gut punch to the integrity of her arc. The film remains gorgeous, heartfelt, and thrilling, but the ending leaves a lingering sense of disappointment that such a powerful character was denied the full impact of her own story.",figurative
"excellent series (must see) This series is one of the best that EVER appeared on TV. Considering how much TV we are watching nowadays, this looks exaggerated, but it is not. The cases (the scripts) originate from the life of the US Navy. They are original, even bizarre sometimes, but it looks that we live with that kind of people.

Second, the acting is very good, and the characters are almost real life people, so sometimes you have to remind yourself that you are watching TV. The actors are not very famous, but they all do an excellent job.

Mark Harmon's character is excellent and I would be very sorry to see him leave the show (S3, 3x23 and 3x24, Hiatus part 1 &2), but let's hope that it is because of the suspense of the cliff-hanger, just trying to keep spectators anxious for the next (fourth) season, which I sincerely hope will be forthcoming.

He is the strongest link, the one who does not talk much, honest to the bone, but deeply compassionate. He takes care of everybody and holds them together (not only his team, but the families of the victims, and sometimes even the criminals). The others follow and, when you have a good leader, everything is possible. You have to see it to believe it. 

I could write for hours, but watching any episode will do the trick and replace pages of writing. 

I also recommend The Hill Street Blues (1980's series) which introduced this kind of approach to the police work, but on a slightly different level. 

There is magic on TV (Star Trek-TNG quality if you like), and it can be seen in NCIS.",literal
"Really enjoyed it! We love Liam so had to see this one! Husband and I thought it was really good, definitely and ending that we weren't expecting. Liam never seems to disappoint either! Watch it pretty good one!",literal
"Exposing multiple and hidden levels of mysoginy It took me about two episodes to really, really get into this, but then I was 100% hooked. Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon, and the other are doing a great job, the script is intelligent and surprising, the dialogues sharp. It does well at making different layers of mysoginy visible while not oversimplifying the discussion of that topic or making it flat.

In my opinion this is Anistons best performance as an actress yet (and I am a big fan of Friends, so that is saying something).

I am not generally interested in the media world, but this reeled me in. If you like The Good Wife, you will love this, too.",literal
"Beautiful movie for kids (and secretly the very grown up parents too) Solid story. Relatable cute characters. Fantastic animation (especially the water). And the soundtrack is just dope. I'm a bit ashamed to admit how much I like this movie, even anonymously on the internet, but I do. If you're looking for some lighthearted family entertainment, it doesn't get much better than this.",literal
"Season 1 and 2 ... 3 coming soon. One of the greatest tv shows ever made. Within its hilarious ridiculousness there is a great addictive satisfaction you receive knowing the hero Saitama who is so likable reguardless of his bored attitude along with such a loveable innocence being unbeatable by absolutely anything that comes his way and without ever really giving much effort one punch and the enemy is dead. It's so satisfying that you just want to rewatch it. The idea is of course mental. But the story is amazing. And without ever really receiving the glory and fame he deserves he always saves the world and is left with just us the watcher to love and appreciate him for who he is. It's funny, it's deep, it's scary, it's artistic.

Season 1 is perfect! Couldn't be any better. Even the opening song! To the end credits song. Both so different but both gave us an essence of the two sides to Saitama. From start to finish, nothing else to say it's perfect.

Season 2 is great! Although... the lack of showing our main hero was annoying. And leaving the monsters and other hero's have such long conversations and fights which kinda lead to no where, you end up just wondering where is saitama!? And he spends a lot of the time playing with another hero on video games. Which was a funny idea but went on too long. I think the story is still great and new characters were interesting but should have definitely kept the same energy and feeling of the first season. AND WHY! Did they change the opening song and end credits not going to lie I was devastated. Haha!

Season 3! The trailer has been released and shows us Garou fighting some of the old monsters we have seen before and then reveals Saitama! Release date has not been confirmed while I am writing this but I have read articles saying it is possible the show will air very soon and maybe even this year! I just hope! They return to the old elements of season 1 and please!!bring back that opening song and end credits song again. Which were just such nostalgic saitama one punch man vibes!!!

Overall...Perfect!",literal
"Can't beat the British spy thriller ..done the right way. Oldman grows into his name, and only gets better with each passing year like a vintage wine.

Give him a decent script with plenty of pregnant pauses for a glare or three and let his acting chops do the rest. He's become to the spy thriller as Gielgud was to Hamlet ..made for each other!

Kristin Scott Thomas..is cast well as his politicking ladder climbing spymaster, who brings her own gravitas, ie. Beyond the twinset & pearls..lies a cold calculating etc .. And you've got to be doing something right to get one Sir Mick Jagger to co-write and sing the shows theme song!

Season three halfway point..they may have slightly overdone Oldman's unwashed look, as it's now like he sleeps on a park bench at night before staggering into the 'spy office'.. but still a riveting watch..!",literal
"Needed tranquelizers Exciting, but I find Aggie's constant, overwrought behavior so over the top. More subtlety would have made it stronger. I keep thinking, ""she needs some tranquilizers?"" All that sighing, those exasperated looks, that panic. It would have been more believable if there were some relaxed moments, even if you have PTTS, which is also present. A minor drawback.",literal
"Mid I had high hopes because Toni is amazing but this fell so short. Mae cannot act, full stop. Their comedy is decent, so they should stick to that.

This was also so painfully predictable I only kept watching to see if I was right in my guesses (I was).

1312 includes Mae now.

In the hands of better writers and show runners this could be better.",literal
"What the heck? Read the book, it's a lot better than what is presented here. The male lead is definitely handsome but how much more boring could a character be? And the way the librarian starts making all kinds of relationship assumptions right at the start is off-putting. Hello, I'm late and by the way I'm not interested in a relationship. Well, then, why did you answer a singles ad? Which, by the way, isn't the way they meet in the book. I guess maybe it takes some time to flesh the characters out at the beginning of a new series but this one isn't off to a good start in my opinion. So far it's more like a wet foggy soggy piece of melodrama.",literal

Hulu, I swear, if I get invested into this show and you cancel it after one or two seasons, Im cancelling my Hulu like I did Netflix and never returning. This is a great show...finally!

"This show is SO GOOD! I watched it when it first came out - 2016 - and was up to date with the 3rd season. But it's been so long between the 3rd and 4th seasons, that I decided to watch it from the beginning. OMG! Watching the 1st season again had me riveted, again! Totally worth it, too! This show is really SO VERY GOOD! The story, the writing, the acting, the cinematography especially, all first rate! I'm about to start season 4 and I can't wait!",literal
"Fantastic show! I love this show for the characters, the dialogue, the story, and the relationships. It's a bit over the top at times, but that's what makes it so fun. It takes itself seriously, but not too seriously. The relationships between the characters are very non-traditional and I enjoy almost every character in their own way. I've read some harsh reviews about this show and they just seem completely unfounded to me. My only advice would be to watch the show. If you don't like it, you'll probably know soon enough that it's not for you. If you are like me, this is one of those shows that you'd be very sorry for missing out on.",literal
"The movie that made Jim Carrey king of comedy... When i first saw the teaser trailer for this movie before Mission Impossible my thought was...how could they match the wit of the 1960s cartoon as well as the book it was based on? Well, they did a great job making the grinch who he is while showing an origin story of how he became a grinch. This is why this film dominated the box office for the year 2000 and made Carrey a billionaire. Before you go see the CGI Grinch, watch the 1960s special after you read the book, then see this movie. It's worth watching!!!",literal

"coming from an american, the UK version is soooo much better Maybe i'm biased bc i watched the UK version first but, the US version is so cringey, the writing feels very watered down & generic & it feels very like forced comedy. I was actually expecting a lot better since the original was soo good. I'm american, so like when i say the UK version is like 10x better in writing/acting & it feels less forced than this one :/

They sorta rushed through the beginning comparatively to the original, but that was expected. But that didnt really bother me. What kinda irked me was how ""sitcomified"" it felt even though it is a sitcom. The UK version had a nice flow, the jokes weren't that forced and/or cringey.

But i mean its an easy watch.",literal
"Locked, Loaded... and Then MisfTired Weapons begins with the promise of a taut psychological thriller, offering just enough atmosphere to make you lean forward in your seat. There is a fine early creepiness-those little shivers born of suggestion rather than spectacle. But like so many Hollywood thrillers, it mistakes the mere appearance of menace for its actual substance.

By the midpoint, the script has already begun to feed on itself, coughing up ""mysteries"" it has no intention of solving. Plot holes appear like potholes on a neglected road-large enough to break your narrative suspension. The jump scares, while occasionally competent, are used as a crutch for tension rather than an escalation of it. One feels, by the fourth or fifth orchestral sting, that the film is frantically waving its arms and shouting ""Boo!"" in lieu of storytelling.

The true crime, however, lies in the villain. Here is a figure who could have anchored the entire production-malevolent, intriguing, a mirror for our own fears-but instead we get a sketch where a portrait was needed. Motivation is hinted at, never illuminated. Complexity is suggested, then abandoned.

By the end, we are left with neither catharsis nor clarity, merely the limp aftertaste of a premise squandered. In Weapons, the early promise of menace dissolves into the banality of unanswered questions. It is the cinematic equivalent of a loaded gun never fired-dangerous-looking, but ultimately inert.",literal
"Hands Down the Greatest Television Drama of All-Time You read it right. This show just blew me away. I wasn't even a huge TV show fan. I would peek in from time to time on popular shows for some good entertainment, but none of them hooked me. It was just something I would do when I was bored.

Then came Breaking Bad. I got lucky. One night, about six years ago or so, maybe seven, I was watching a classic movie on AMC- I think it was Goodfellas or Gladiator- one of the ones they always show. The credits went to black and I was expecting another movie in the lineup. Instead, I saw a unique shot in the desert and a Winnebago barreling through with some khaki pants flying through the air, as it revealed a guy in a gasmask driving it in his underwear with another guy passed out.

At first I thought it was another 90s Hollywood movie, maybe something in Vegas like Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas or something quirky like that, but then I realized it wasn't. I had no idea what it was- I had never seen this ""movie"" before. But I couldn't stop watching. Soon, there was a commercial and I realized it was a TV show.

And let me tell you...what came next was literally the best and most well spent TV/movie viewing hours that I had in the better part of two decades. What went onto occur blew my mind at every turn. The genius and brilliance in the subtleties and acting that came forth was unbelievable.

I barely left my room for three days as AMC was running a marathon on what is now widely believed to be the greatest show of all-time, but I had no idea about that then. All I knew is that I couldn't stop watching and felt like I was addicted to it....Just so intriguing, beautiful, real, amazing, and shocking.

Then came late season 4 and season 5, and I was speechless. It's not that seasons 1-3 weren't great, but when late 4 and 5 arrived, I practically jumped out of my couch and lost it. I was not expecting anything like that, but it was hands down some of the greatest filmmaking I had ever seen going back to the 70s. Honestly, words just cannot describe it. All I can say is this is the greatest show of all time. Enjoy.",figurative
"The usual irresistible woman plot line I recently fell down the rabbit hole that is the Chicago series, and I'm loving it.

Two things that drive me mad: Gaby Dawson - she's the amazing, much loved and wanted female lead (see the same thing in The Blacklist, where the whole world wants Lizzie). Everyone worships her and most of the drama centres around her. She is NOT all that and it's just annoying. I'm just glad I know she's gone further down the line.

Second, Chief Bowden. He's awesome. But the constant deep, gravelly, slow, stern voice, is just annoying. And he *never* takes off his jacket. He's inside, take the damn thing off. And I think he's smiled less than ten times so far. He just makes me feel like 'dude, get over yourself, crack a smile, relax a little'.",literal
"Fans and Filmmaking Folks who are fans of the original series don't always understand the medium.

As I read the reviews, I'd like to address a few things.

First, Stowell is one inch taller than Harmon. One inch. Also, when a person gets older, they often lose height. One inch makes little difference. However, the original cast-mates were taller making Harmon look less imposing than Stowell. This is a casting choice to give a character a storied feel.

Second, it doesn't have the same feel as NCIS on purpose. This is an origin story. Gibbs was a very different character in a very different time. You're literally a couple stories into the understanding of who he was and how he came to be the person you knew. Think of doing a story about yourself in grade 5 vs. You now. Would it look exactly like who you are now? I know of boys growing up as 8 yr olds with bowties who ended up bikers. This is the point to the series.

Give the series time to show you the progression. I like the feel of this series so far. I find it well-written, well-acted, fairly true to period and fairly true to the origin we knew of Gibbs. He will grow into the person we know. I look forward to watching more and seeing how this develops.

Get out of your own way and go for the ride...enjoy.",literal
"A Haunting Exploration of Human Connection Nobody Wants This is a poignant and thought-provoking film that delves into the complexities of human relationships. The movie masterfully weaves together themes of loneliness, rejection, and the search for meaning.

The cinematography is breathtaking, capturing the bleakness and isolation of the characters' lives. The performances are equally impressive, with the cast delivering nuanced and emotionally charged portrayals.

What resonates most about Nobody Wants This is its unflinching examination of the human condition. The film asks difficult questions about our desires, our fears, and our capacity for connection.

If you're prepared for a cinematic experience that will leave you introspective and perhaps a little unsettled, then ""Nobody Wants This"" is a must-see.

Recommendation: For fans of character-driven dramas and those who appreciate thought-provoking storytelling.",literal
"Interesting but that's all When I was a child, there were short science-fiction series on TV. They were fascinating and always left us with curious questions. It was a joy to watch those short films.

While watching Pluribus, they came to my mind. The story is interesting, and the acting and sets are quite good. But what is it exactly? A TV series, or a film divided into episodes?

Cinema storytelling has advanced a lot since my childhood, yet Pluribus gave me a nostalgic feeling. From an artistic point of view, I'm truly sorry to say I have almost nothing positive to add.

If you have time, you can watch it-just to pass the time.",literal
"A great show This is a great show, another milestone procedural.

The law & order refer to the bipartite police & DA sides of investigating & prosecuting crime.

Despite a rotating cast that changed over the years, this show remained spot on in many ways:

1) great story lines; 2) great acting; 3) edgy legal theories tested in court; 4) edgy moral and legal questions; 5) plots often mirroring real life stories; 6) a very ""New York"" feel, with every character speaking in a Bronx, Brooklyn or Staten Island accent, and a multi-ethnic cast that is street wise; and 7) after the first seasons of Michael Moriarty, who was good, they brought in Yalie Sam Waterston, who was born to play the part of the leading DA/Prosecutor in this show. One cannot say enough about how great he is in this show; he is fantastic.

My only small kvetch is, they do a lot of extraction of confessions from defendants they know or should know are represented by counsel, which are shown over and over; these are in real life Miranda violations, even with the conservative narrowing of Miranda by the Scalia & Robert's Courts.

But, it's only TV, and we love it.

A must see. The bit characters on the streets of NYC are the best! See this, now!",literal
"Magnificent Obsession Jane Wyman's beloved, saint like husband dies because the resuscitator he needs is being used to revive playboy idiot Rock Hudson. When Hudson finds out he decides to change his ways and start helping everyone including Wyman who he falls for.

Whilst this is a handsomely mounted Hollywood tearjerker with a fine pedigree, it features the most ridiculously unconvincing sentimental story that could have been imagined. With Wyman impossibly sickly sweet throughout and Hudson deathly serious as he goes through some form of epiphany, and backed by bucket of choral music, this is just too much treacle to take.",literal
"Has its faults but still worth watching Much has already been said in other IMDb reviews about the foul language (uttered even by Chester A. Arthur!), the nudity, and the random sex. Take away these items and this 4-part mini series could be shown in high schools. But alas, those elements make the show feel more like Boardwalk Empire than a historical drama about James Garfield, who served the shortest Presidential term in US history (thus far).

The main reasons to watch the series (which is binge-worthy): The acting, by Michael Shannon of course, brilliant and low key as Garfield, but especially British actor Matthew Macfadyen, who just sinks into the role of the assassin Charles J. Guiteau. In fact, the series is really more about Guiteau, who was a dreamer , a hanger-on, and then a stalker, initially stalking Garfield because he believed the new President would truly be a man for the people, not just another political ""hack."" Eventually disillusioned, he continues to stalk the President, but not out of awe.

The four-part running time allows exposition, for both Garfield before his Presidency, and in particular Guiteau, the black sheep of an Illinois family and clearly suffering from assorted psychological problems. There are moments in the series that recall the breakdown of Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver, who had similar fixations on a populist political figure, albeit for different reasons.

The sex and nudity in the series mainly come from the religious (more like pagan) groups he falls into, including one in upstate New York where just as much time is spent fornicating (in barns and meadows) as reading the Bible.

Back to the city, though. Another actor of note is Shea Whigham, who plays boisterous, corrupt, vulgar (of course) and proud of it Congressman Roscoe Conklin. Whigham worked with Shannon in Boardwalk Empire and also appeared with him in the underrated film Take Shelter. As portrayed in the series, Conklin is a ""MAGA"" type 100+ years before MAGA was even a political proclamation. Money and power was what he was all about, and initially he had a willing accomplice by his side as his enforcer. The accomplice's name was Chester A. Arthur.

Comedian Nick Offerman turns in an unexpected and layered performance as Arthur, who is a thug in the first episodes, but after being chosen as Garfield's running mate, and then becoming Vice President, gradually reforms. Garfield explains to him that even after Arthur attempts to resign, he recognized ""goodness under the bluster."" Prior to his partnership with Conklin, Arthur was an advocate for social programs following the end of the Civil War. As the successor to Garfield, Arthur severed ties with his New York/Conklin past to become one of the first U. S. Presidents to tackle the Civil Rights issue.

The profanity and the sex aside, this is a generally absorbing mini series that if anything, could have been an episode or two longer.",figurative
"It deserves higher rating The show is a delightful surprise, blending humor and charm in a way that makes it a joy to watch. While it's not meant to be taken too seriously, it excels in creating an entertaining experience that keeps you coming back for more. Each episode is packed with action, twists, and a good dose of humor, making it hard to predict what will happen next.

Kristen Wiig truly shines in her role, delivering one of her best performances to date. Her comedic timing and ability to bring depth to her character are standout elements that elevate the show. The rest of the cast is equally impressive, with each member bringing their A-game, creating a dynamic ensemble that works seamlessly together.

The costume design is another highlight, adding a layer of visual appeal that complements the show's quirky tone. The attention to detail in the costumes helps to enhance the overall aesthetic, making it a feast for the eyes.

Although the final episode could have been handled better, it doesn't detract much from the overall enjoyment of the series. The show manages to find its own rhythm and succeeds in delivering a fun, engaging experience that leaves you pleasantly surprised by just how entertaining it is.",figurative
"This is a superb and gutsy show. I caught this series on the Hallmark channel here in the UK about a year a go.  I remember watching an episode one night without knowing what is was all about.  From that moment I have been hooked.  It delves into the deepest and darkest sides of people and why they act the way they do - the programme manages to find a balance between entertainment and education, without being too voyeuristic.  I think the acting is wonderful - realistic and very insightful - I especially like the leads Meloni and Hargitey.  I know they are showing series 4 on US television.  It is a gutsey and unique drama series which continues to hold court amoungst the most popular shows in America.  I hope this series continues for a very long time.",literal

This exciting film contains action , thrills, suspense , blood , a little bit of humor and is plenty of graphical violence . Special effects laden adaptation of the Stephen King novel , under his Richard Bachman pseud , he wrote the story in 72 hours and was screen-written by Steven Souza , the film is based very loosely on the novel of the same name . The story deals with a futuristic TV game show in which each game are selected some convicts to participate in a brutal man-chase wherein felons are given the chance to run to freedom but have to elude the stalkers ; men who hunt them down and kill them in gruesome manners . 'The Running Man' game seen in the film was based upon an early 1980's Japanese game show called 'Trans American Ultra Quiz', in which contestants were tortured in various ways and the prize went to whichever contestant could stand the pain/humiliation the longest . The movie displays strong and realistic fights and excellent action sequences with bloody attacks and violent , blistering struggles . The picture belong to ¨dystopian world¨ genre as well as the tyrannical control by the government of ¨1984¨ and death games films such as ¨Battle Royale¨ (Kinji Fukasaku) and the recent ¨Hunger Games¨(Gary Ross). Arnold Schwarzenegger is an appropriate and powerful warrior , he steals the spectacle as one army man , as enemies are dispatched in turn ; in addition , he holds the brief comic relief . Dolph Lundgren and Christopher Reeve were interested to star in the movie, and Patrick Swayze had also been considered. Arnold , Governor of California , along with Maria Conchita Alonso have both starred in the Predator movies. Jesse Ventura , Governor of Minnesota , starred in the first Predator film . Ample plethora of secondary actors give bouncing performances as Professor Tanaka , Jim Brown , Yaphet Kotto , Zappa , Fleetwood and Sven-Ole Thorsen . Furthermore , Erland van Lidth's and Richard Dawson's last film. Thrilling and commercial musical score by Harold Faltermeyer , it was composed by means of synthesizer . Colorful and adequate cinematography by Thomas Del Ruth . The motion picture lavishly produced by Rob Cohen was well directed by Paul Michael Glaser (Starsky and Hutch) . Rating : Good . Well worth watching .",literal
"Artistic license is acceptable Yes! The timeline is skewedin order to get the feel for what happened to these people based on extensive research and i investigation along the way.

To fully appreciate the depth of what happened, you need to take the time and use common sense instead of expecting a immediate unerstanding of the world as it was 4 years ago and today. Listen to the original podcasts (now remastered) to understand.

There would be no way to do a true to life movie without setting aside 4+ years to see it with the same characters, places, etc. Unfortunately, that is not possible because at least 5 characters are no longer with us. The acting is superb.. Kudos to the casting team! The corruption of the murdaughs was struck down. Positive changes have happened in SC because of the results of all the hard work of the prosecutors. I believe the persistence of Mandy and Liz set the stage for this change to take hold and grow in this state. I'm speechless.",literal

"If you like political propaganda Holy smokes - how do I describe this. I enjoyed the first season, nearly completely, but the second season was oddly a division of fairly impartial story telling and propaganda. Season three was a complete political and social propaganda washout and a huge disappointment. I found myself skipping ahead for most of the second and third seasons due to the predictable and boring content. My question to the producers - what happened between season one and two and three that would cause you to change course from story telling to preaching? You diverted from the original intriguing story to trash in season two and three.",literal
"Series 1/Series 2 I grew up near where this is set, so I wondered whether I'd like it, would the Diné just be the usual noble savages, etc. Though it was far from perfect, I enjoyed the first series. Although Leaphorn and his wife, Emma, seem to be the central characters, and are well acted, I thought some of the best characterisations were those of Jim and Bernadette, which were really well written and acted. The plot was suitably puzzling and kept me watching.

I finally got round to Series 2. It's not nearly as good. My rating of 7 is really an average of a 9 for series 1 and a 5 for series 2. This series feels like it's probably a victim of a bigger budget. It has traded an intriguing storyline for melodrama, and actual excitement for pyrotechnics and gore. People don't just get wounded (and most of the characters seem to) they get wounded repeatedly and carry on like so many zombies. Honestly, if you want to watch television just to experience vicarious pain, you'll love this. It got old. The violence felt gratuitous, as did some of the side-stories.

Also paid for by the big budget (I guess) is a bigger supporting cast of tribal police, some of whom seem to be there to provide a bit of ""Injun humour"". Leaphorn also inexplicably lives in a nicer house, and owns a flock of sheep. A lot of things feel a bit ""Instagram aesthetic Navajo"" now. The acting is still good but the script and production values have really dropped.",literal
"Richness all around The depth of the characters and how the writing doesn't beat to any drum you care about has me waiting for each episode with keenness.

I love the theme that underpins the whole thing together: The fallout of criminal intent on children.

With only one episode left, it's hard to know what they will spend their time on, but that in and of itself is refreshing. A series that doesn't try and wrap itself up with a neat bow by the last episode.",literal
"Insightful and Relevant A long movie. Some of the older demographic that it attracts to watch it, had to take a comfort break begore the end.

A good recreation of the 1940s, and the mindsets of the time, in a world emerging from devastation.

Russell Crowe plays a very believeable Hermann Göring, in a way that at times can even create an impression of likeability.

The portrayal of the psychologist by Rami Malek, who previously portrayed Freddie Mercury, is an effective counterpoint.

Hangings are horrible, and of course some hangings are involved. While chilling, these scenes are not dwelled upon.

It's obvious that the filmmakers want to remind us of how tyranny arises, and how it can arise in any society, including our own.

For us, this movie was well worth watching.",literal
"Wonderful political drama I really enjoyed the show. It was filled with a great cast. Kudos to the acting prowess of Michael Shannon, Bradley Whitford, Matthew Macfadyen, and Betty Gilpin. I was truly moved by the story and humility of James A. Garfield, and the madness of his assassin Charles J. Guiteau. The supporting character portrayed by Bradley Whitford as James Blaine lit up the screen with drama and humor as only he can do it. Betty Gilpin was wonderful, as well. Give this a watch!

"Supposed to be a time of cheer After a vacation to Wally World and a European vacation, Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) has traded in his old son and daughter for two new kids and a ""Christmas Vacation."" Who would not prefer Juliette Lewis over Dana Hill for the part of Audrey?

It seems that writer John Hughes entered a more physical comedy stage of his career that we'd see in ""Uncle Buck"" and the two ""Home Alones."" I guess watching ""Christmas Vacation"" after the three aforementioned movies made ""Christmas Vacation"" somewhat hohum.

Instead of being on the road making a fool of himself and screwing things up, Clark is at home doing that. To be fair, he did have the help of his off kilter family, but Clark is still the sultan of screw-ups. There were some laughs to be had though I felt like I'd seen much of the material before. Christmas is supposed to be a time of holiday cheer except I didn't find myself cheering too much.",figurative

"NOW THAT'S FANTASTIC! Watched on July 23rd & 24th, 2025

I said the other day that The Fantastic Four: First Steps serves as a palate cleanser for all Marvel movies that came before, while Thunderbolts* drags us back to its roots when the billion-dollar franchise is still at its peak in the early days. This movie surely gives us a glimpse of hope and shows us that the MCU is slowly rising back to where it used to be. Despite knowing that they made an excellent choice by setting this movie in an alternate universe and just letting the story move and breathe freely without ties to the main timeline, I can't deny the feeling of doubt when the runtime was first announced, fearing that everything would be rushed and that too many things would be squeezed into the movie. But hey, I also told myself if they can make it work in just 115 minutes, then it's fantastic.

Should I say that again? Yes, it's a fantastic introduction to Marvel's first family, who are finally joining the MCU, and they actually do these characters real justice this time around. Look, I don't know about others, but I've grown tired of the traditional origin story in every superhero movie. Why not throw us in their early years when the heroes are trying to grasp the reality that they have now and the responsibility that follows after their lives changed for the better?. This is what the four of them carry on their shoulder onwards as the people will always look up to them, and then suddenly be forced to face something beyond their experience and knowledge, even for the smartest man alive, Reed Richards. The family dynamics that the four of them share have never been better depicted on screen and I don't even need to talk about Galactus, you just have to see and ""hear"" him for yourself on the biggest screen and loudest speakers you can find. I assure you, he doesn't disappoint, unlike his previous movie iteration.

I literally found out a couple of days ago that there weren't auditions for the main actors; they basically just met with the director, Matt Shakman, and got the part. But who could've guessed that the chemistry between the family is perfect and each of them is the right person to play it. As much as I like Pedro, he's the only one I couldn't fully connect with just yet, probably due to him not being given much to do while wearing the white and blue suit, though he's great when being a genius scientist and a father. Vanessa Kirby definitely takes the spotlight, and damn, she's perfect as Sue.

The Fantastic 4: First Steps is one of the most visually vibrant (and confident?) Marvel movies, and it has ""some"" of the most impressive CGI ever put on screen. There's one scene involving the Silver Surfer in space, and it's clean and dope as hell.",literal

I just read an article on how studios are ""dumbing down"" tv because they think it's all ""second screen"" i.e. People are on their phones while the tv runs in the background. The problem is, shows like this are the result. Do we all have to just rewatch The Sopranos or Deadwood to see quality stories being told?

I miss the way 90's films were filmed and this movie was able to capture that before technology changed the Hollywood scene. Sit back, don't think of anything and enjoy... It's the simple.",literal
"refreshing reboot This film serves as a confident and refreshing reboot of the DC cinematic universe. Unlike Zack Snyder's Superman, it avoids revisiting the well trodden origin story which is a smart choice, given that most audiences are already familiar with Superman's beginnings. One of the film's standout elements is Lex Luthor's intense disdain for Superman, portrayed with a sharp and often humorous edge that adds depth to their rivalry. Overall, it's a strong entry and a promising start to James Gunn's new vision for the DC universe.",literal
"A Masterclass in Displaying Anxiety If I Had Legs I'd Kick You is a film that's difficult to describe in a way that would immediately convince someone to see it. I decided to watch it after hearing some buzz from festivals, but I went in not really knowing what to expect. I'm very glad I did, because what I found was a deeply unique film that experiments with storytelling techniques in bold and fascinating ways. I'll try to be as clear as possible about the story without revealing too much.

The film follows Linda (Rose Byrne) as she struggles to care for her daughter, who suffers from an unnamed illness. While already weighed down by this, her apartment's ceiling collapses, forcing her and her daughter to move into a motel. Her husband is out of town for weeks, she's going to counselling while also working as a counsellor herself, and she's barely holding things together as she turns to alcohol and drugs for relief. The film's plot isn't built around big events, but rather a series of small, stressful moments that build an overwhelming portrait of a woman on the edge.

That may sound like a loose structure-and it is-but that seems to be exactly the point. The movie thrives on tension and unease, creating an almost suffocating atmosphere. Rose Byrne carries the film entirely on her shoulders, and her performance is riveting from start to finish. One particularly daring choice is that the daughter's face is never shown; instead, her voice becomes another source of Linda's constant anxiety. Combined with the film's editing and score, this choice keeps the viewer in the same disoriented headspace as the protagonist. Writer-director Mary Bronstein handles all of this with impressive control. Having previously worked on small indie features in the late 2000s and contributed to Safdie Brothers projects, this feels like her voice finally coming through loud and clear.

Ultimately, If I Had Legs I'd Kick You is a masterclass in translating anxiety onto the screen. It's less about plot and more about the emotional toll of struggling through life's hardest moments, and in that sense, it succeeds completely. The film made me uncomfortable at times, but I couldn't look away. There's not much story on paper, yet the execution, its mood, performances, and visual style, all make it one of my favorite films of 2025 so far. Some viewers may scratch their head because of how it ends, but I still absolutely recommend it.",literal
"Never been so moved by television This is arguably one of the best things created by the human race.

"Been There, Done That, But Better I'm going to keep it short. Going by the overal quality of the first 2 episodes IT as a show is decent at best. As unsettling and relentlessly cruel IT is with its horror as on the big screen, it is with everything in between where it fails to hit the same check boxes. From some of the worst child acting i've seen in a long time to the overal writing and pacing, it simply all feels very lazy, generic and uninspired and so far just seems like an unnecessary addition to the franchise. We already had this, but better. So maybe stick to the recent cinematic two parter and the classic (book).",literal
"The movie felt underwhelming and the story had a lot of shortcomings Did not enjoy. I felt like I am wasting my time. I have a lot to say to the studios, but since I am not a filmmaker, I'll restraint.

It just did not live up to the hype, and the story did not feel nice. VFX was better... I enjoyed the background score all the time. The characters written, I loved reed and johny. Sue's character did not sit right with me. But what do I know. It is just what I feel like.",literal
"1993-1996 Seasons The interest in these rather old (more than twenty years old) seasons is in the obsolescence of so many things that do not exist anymore or the absence of what is common today. This is TV archaeology. Thus you have the big monstrous PCs, the old dial telephones, the old enormous cars, and no smart phones, no portable phones, no tablets, and even practically no bikes. The traffic is practically fluid and you can park your car anywhere easily. Security is light, the presence of cops and even thieves is light too. The police force is hardly racially integrated, definitely very little at investigating police level and same thing at justice, DA and court level. This vision of the world in New York in the early 1990s is amazing. Do you remember it? Or rather can you imagine it?

The second element is typical of US American-centered vision. Every episode starts with the sentence: ""In a criminal justice system,"" wrongly quoted as ""In the criminal justice system, the people are represented by two separate, yet equally important, groups: the police, who investigate crime; and the district attorneys, who prosecute the offenders. These are their stories,"" by http://lawandorder.wikia.com/wiki/Law_%26_Order, because it is not true of any criminal justice system in the world and the use of ""A criminal justice system"" implies the universality of the remark. I checked I do not know how many dozens of episodes and it was always the same, the use of the American-centered indefinite article. What is shown in this series is purely American. In many other systems in the world investigation means looking into what the prosecution can use and what the defense can use. The defense research or investigation is not paid by the accused and done by his lawyer but most of it is done by the investigating team under the responsibility of a judge. 

It is this very justice system of the USA that leads to the worst possible jury decisions that are irreversible because no one can be tried twice for the same offense. . . In other words, they only look for a culprit and as soon as they find one – or they are convinced they have found one – they are satisfied and go to court.

The series is very clear about that and many episodes show how tricky it is if the defense does not investigate on their own side. They even actually show cases in which the investigation is wrong, the jury finds the defendant guilty and the judge sends him to prison to serve a 25 to life sentence and yet right away afterwards new elements come up showing that the culprit is another man who was exonerated. They cannot reverse the jury decision. The judge cannot change it at all. They have to find a way to beat about the bush, negotiate the obstacle and use a detour to prove the other suspect guilty without bringing the first convicted one into the picture. Then and only then the first trial can be voided. The least we can say is that it is slightly distorted. Some might say corrugated.

That's probably the best side of this series: it does not hide the fact that the American criminal justice system is deeply problematic. In spite of their Miranda warning that states what follows: ""You have the right to remain silent and refuse to answer questions. Anything you say may be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to consult an attorney before speaking to the police and to have an attorney present during questioning now or in the future. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you before any questioning if you wish. etc.,"" in spite of that the prosecution will not target both guilt AND innocence but ONLY guilt. And over and over again the episodes show how bungled a case can get when the defense attorney is not diligent enough. 

This series shows all judicial mistakes come from the basic police work at the root of everything else afterward. The police work is often based on a personal conviction or even belief more than facts. The advantage of the police shown here is that the lieutenant who follows the investigation performed by his or her (in this case her) detectives can challenge them and the facts they bring up and ask them to look in other directions, to check other sides of the situation. But even so, nothing is clear. The main issue – or one of the main issues – is the role of women and in this particularly series the lieutenant is a woman, what's more ethnic, and the assistant district attorney Jack McCoy's assistant, Claire Kincaid, is also a woman. They often bring in a new note, a softening note, at times an alternative approach. But that is not in any way based on truth and the search for truth but on the deep conviction the case of women, or relevant facts that only women can see have been ignored. 

The next step in this series is the importance of deals reached by the public prosecutor with the defense before the court decision. Such deals are not dealing with justice nor even the truth but only with speeding up the procedure, save on court expenses and most of the time reduce the sentence by reducing the qualification of the crime. And when wrongly accused the duress is so hard in some situations that the innocent person accepts to plead guilty in exchange of a soft sentence, but yet it is fake justice. . .

"A study of intolerable behavior Honestly, this almost feels like an experiment, created to see if it's possible to cram as many cringe-worthy moments as possible in a show, before the viewers give up. It's beautifully packaged, no doubt, with good direction, good cinematography and generally good acting, but I physically hated each and every one of the characters - no one excluded - and spent all my time wondering why their behavior ranged somewhere from mildly deplorable to downright unbearable.

I think it wants to be a satirical commentary on a particularly pampered demographic in society: white, oblivious rich people. And sure, it's a fairly well-deserving target for scorn. But it's done in a rather ham-fisted way, with characters who incomprehensibly lack almost any social skills, or act cluelessly in what are otherwise pretty normal situations. It didn't need to be so on-the-nose with the critique - if it indeed is critique - is my point.",literal
"Paging Dr. Absurd: St. Denis Medical Pokes Fun at TV's Hospital Drama Obsession *St. Denis Medical* plays like a tongue-in-cheek roast of hospital dramas, taking on the genre's endless parade of personal crises that rarely leave room for actual medicine. Rather than saving lives with stoic resolve, the doctors and nurses here are tangled in their own quirks and foibles: a head doctor terrified of needles, a new nurse bumbling his way through basic tasks, and an administrator more focused on boosting the hospital's reputation than fixing its dysfunction. Unlike *Grey's Anatomy*, where every love affair is treated as a life-or-death scenario, *St. Denis Medical* winks at the audience, pointing out how ridiculous it would be if real hospitals ran on the same level of personal drama. The show subtly mocks the genre's formulaic conventions, making it clear that a world this messy is far from the heroics-filled hospitals that medical dramas have sold us for years.

What makes *St. Denis Medical* refreshing, though, is that it doesn't shy away from showing just how flawed the healthcare system-and by extension, the people running it-really are. It hints at genuine issues like underfunding and overworked staff, but opts to show these truths through the lens of absurdity rather than earnest social commentary. The satire might be soft, but there's a pointedness in the way it tackles certain archetypes: the aloof, ""House""-inspired diagnostician who ironically fears the sight of blood, or the overzealous administrator who believes a pep rally will fix morale in a crumbling ER. These jabs may be gentle, but they still get their mark across, highlighting just how absurd it is that so many real-life crises end up buried beneath the genre's melodramatic formula. By not being afraid to laugh at itself, *St. Denis Medical* stands as a self-aware takedown of TV's longstanding obsession with medical heroics.",figurative
"The Office (US) Normally American remakes of British shows are terrible, but boy was this the exception. This show is PHENOMENAL, everything about it works, the characters, the camerawork, the lack of laugh track, the comedy. All of the characters work PERFECTLY (Michael, Jim, Dwight, Pam, Kevin etc), all of the jokes role off of them so well. Although the show massively declined after Steve Carrel (Michael Scott) left but they did the best they could and seasons 8 and 9 still had some great moments, but Michael Scott IS the office, he's what made the show so good, although Dwight is the best character. SUCH a fantastic show from start to finish. 10 out of 10.",literal
"I loved it I honestly loved it. The first episodes of the series really made me laugh and I also loved the dynamic between the two sisters.

I'm glad there was a happy ending and I'm looking forward to the second season! PS I really liked the sister, I'm waiting to see more of her.

I liked that this series emphasized the characteristics between the characters between the Jew and the non-Jew. I liked how the family interferes and yet hers supports. I liked the part with the ex a little less, it felt unnecessary to me, but again in the end I really enjoyed the series which was fun to watch.",literal
"I feel sorry for Sarah Snook Succession was one hell of a TV show. The four Roy siblings squabbling for their dad's media empire was thrilling viewing. Not only because of the exceptionally terrific writing but the acting too. Although every character was flawed and very unlikeable, they were restraint in expressing their emotions and inner demons. One scene comes to mind when Shiv Roy (Snook) finds out who the successor to her dad's empire is. That one scene where she subtly conveyed shock then disappointment then hate all in a matter of minutes sealed her incredible acting chops.

It couldn't be farther on the opposite scale that All Her Fault has Snook overacting in every one of the 8 episodes. Granted that she plays a mother whose son, Milo (McCloud) has been kidnapped but the script has her crying, shaking out of grief, fear and hatred times eight.

All of the characters seem to be told, ""Lights, Camera and Melodrama!"" If they're not crying, they're constantly saying, ""I'm sorry.""

First episode is gripping then it all goes downhill with melodramatic overacting pile on, more and more in the following episodes. The twists that are set up to be a gasp inducing reaction turns out to be pure incredibile farce. I'm not the only one who thinks this but a TIME TV critic called this show, ""Absolute Nonsense.""

The two subplots around disability are nothing more than to tick the DEI box because they not only add nothing to the storyline but are major distractions to the central story of Milo's kidnapping, hence it's eight episodes when six would have been enough.

All TV shows are soap operas but AHF really pushes the melodrama, twists and suspense and the constant background music to the point it's so offputting. The characters all come out two dimensional no one wants to care about. That's why I feel sorry for Snook because she did the heavy lifting and went really high and mighty with her character's emotions until it just became too unbearable to watch or believe any of it. On the other hand, Fanning and Lillis are under utilised. Talented Lillis (as feisty Beverley Marsh in IT) should have a more presence throughout the series since her character, Carrie plays a pivotal role in Milo's kidnapping but nope, what a shame and it's a loss to the writers not to bulk up her role when they should.

Don't believe the power and hype of streaming platforms and the media who have praise this series to the skies. The only good thing they know going for AHF is Snook. I started watching it because of Snook but now I'm left feeling that she deserved a better series than this absolute nonsense.",figurative
"Gives amusing idiocy a bad name The best review of this comes from an outtake (from actress Isla Fisher) shown near the end of this made-for-Amazon movie: ""That was dumb even for my bad acting."" Several of the actors' names don't appear in the credits; can you guess why that even might be? Yes, it turns out, yes you can. Some teen boys might like this, but then probably not. The Three Stooges are Rhodes Scholars compared to this drivel; I recommend finding a couple of their early shorts (w/Curly) to watch instead of this.",literal
"So boring, everyone who enjoys this is boring too Okay, so that I'm not super negative in this post (I still will be) the film has a fantastic design. I love the retro futurism of the cars, technology, the suits, and everything about the design and costuming. The music is also good as well as the audio in general.

However, this movie is so boring. I am dumbfounded how this movie is scoring so high by some. Truly if this is a movie that reflects a 9 or 10 out of 10 movie critics and regular folk have lost the plot more than I thought they did.

There is no character development - at all. There is no substance. Who cares about these characters truly? They skipped the origin story and character build up. So much attention is focused on the baby and mother. Who cares?

The story is so lame and overdone. No critical thinking required and everything is predictable. Did I say this movie was so boring yet? I literally fell asleep when the female Silver surfer showed up, yawn. Again. Let's just randomly change the genders of characters why not.

The actions of the characters are so boring. The human torch is literally there to be the joke (again so boring without character development) and the sacrifice (oh but who could have thought that the female Silver surfer who cold back and sacrifice herself....so shocking LOL). Such terrible writing.

One of the funny things, also regarding women, is that the only reason that Galactus fell into the teleportation portal was due to Susan Storm screeching at him into it. Yay women power am I right? Let's not establish an actual powerful women character at all - let's just go yay feminism and get the only female superhero on the team to screech (literally) and push him in.

Anyways tldr: no substance, so boring, anyone who rates this film more than a 5 is also a boring person, respectfully.",figurative

Great actors with interesting storylines, it had the perfect amount of humor and heart to go along with the brutal cases brought into the hospital. But then it started to lose it's heart, characters became extremely annoying, and the personal issues of the characters became exhausting as they never seemed to change. Grey's Anatomy had a great cast to start with, then they took those characters and slowly made them unbearable to stand. While eventually getting rid of some of the best actors on the show to replace them with people who you will not be able to tolerate for very long. I wish this show would focus more on the medicine aspect and less on the personal lives of the doctors. It would be nice if they would clean up the cast and get better actors with better storylines or just end the show! 15 seasons is a bit much.",literal
"NYSM 3: Silly Ridiculous Nonsense... but Fun NYSM: NYD is pure B-tier entertainment level of shinanegans, it's a movie that makes you really suspend your belief at the absurd notions of these characters in action set pieces that are literally implausable at heart with a screenplay that is bogged down with so many problems of contrivances, coincidences, predictable tropes, cliches, and much more.

That said, if you go into it expecting a wild fun ride, then you'll be pleasantly entertained for the bulk of the runtime enjoying the banter and chemistry from its large cast giving entertaining performances. Is it top-tier? No. Is it worth checking out? Yes..

"Distracting Amateur Sound The dialog, ADR, and sound mix are so bad that they take you out of the story, shot to shot. On top of that, there's far too whispering and mumbling by the male lead. Half of his dialog is completely lost. Very annoying.",literal
"A Fun, Heartfelt Sequel Freakier Friday taps right into my nostalgia for the 2003 Freaky Friday, a film I loved growing up and still do today. Seeing Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan return more than 20 years later feels right. They still have that perfect dynamic that made the original so special. I'm especially glad to see Lohan continuing her comeback. She brings warmth and charm that remind me of why I loved her performances in the first place.

The plot picks up years after the original, with a new generation introduced to the chaos of a family body swap. When another unexpected switch throws four lives into comedic and heartfelt disarray, both the returning and new characters must navigate each other's worlds again. The setup mirrors the original but adds just enough modern flavor to feel fresh without trying too hard.

One of the highlights for me was seeing familiar faces again. Especially Chad Michael Murray, who slipped back into his role effortlessly. Though he only appears for a brief 15-20 minutes, he brought the same energy and seemed to genuinely enjoy revisiting the character. The film balances eye-roll-inducing nostalgia with moments that really land, making the callbacks more charming than tired.

As a sequel, Freakier Friday doesn't break new ground, but it doesn't need to. It captures the spirit of the original while delivering a strong emotional payoff in the third act that feels earned, not recycled. It's a standard sequel in many ways, but a good one. The old cast shines, the new cast impresses, and overall, I had a genuinely fun time watching it, even though it's pretty standard.",figurative
"Just what we were waiting for Watched the new first 7 episodes of series 4. Wow, especially the episode Dear Billy, the gunfight scene and Max's scene at the graveyard are gripping and so well made. The sound track is spot on. Can't wait until July 1st.",literal
"just started, Fresh, excellent Lead I've watched Kaitlin Olson's previous work before, ""The Mick"". The character was a complete 180 from Morgan in this show. Such a wide range of portrayal talent. Kaitlin barely aged a day from her days at ""The Mick"". Really looking forward to the rest of the series. I hope they go for +10 Seasons.

Great pilot episode. No stalling, no wasted moments throughout the episode. Pacing is perfect, fast when needed fast, slows down when needed attention to focus on the moment.

Morgan's character is strong, independent, highly intelligent, relatable and fun. Interesting interaction with the 3 children so far, looking forward to how the show's gonna divulge more.",literal
"Enjoy the first season and then lower you expectations for the second I loved the first season of this show so much that it compelled me to read the novels and play the wild hunt; both sources having inspired this adaption and the short stories in particular were very faithfully retold in the show. I would absolute recommend the first season.

The second season plot has decided to go it's own way and departed from any canon contained within either the novel or game. I don't mind this as a rule, I'm always excited for a new story and I'm not particularly wedded to the works of Sapkowski. The problem is that the story being told isn't particularly exceptional, it's adequate, it's not as interesting at the narrative contained in the books therefore I don't understand this unrecognisable deviation from the source material. For me it fails to be as compelling as much of the exceptional tv that demands our free time.

It looks good, although the performances slide from exceptional to positively brick like. It's only fine.",literal
"If you don't understand the ending... Just came out of the cinema watching The Running Man and was genuineky entertained for 2 hours. Don't expect the Arnold version. It's just a good popcorn movie that will keep you entertained.

Couldn't Make it Through One Episode Ethan Hawke character was such a sleaze bag and so unlikeable I couldn't even make it though first episode. They were trying to make him a cool rouge character but they went way overboard and make him a scummy unlikable person. The supporting cast seem to be interesting and always a joy to see Keith David in about anything he does but even he couldn't save this show about a low down dirt bag.,literal
Second-screen but catchy series Nothing crazy in terms of series but quite entertaining. Story was catchy and characters's developments were cheesy but kinda fun. Scenes and color correction and overall production is nice but what was a bit bothering was the modern songs onto historical drama... I dunno they delivered to different vibes to it and were kinda clashing?? Looking forward to next season though.,literal
"I loved it, maybe because of the flaws. It could have been 10, but there were weak points in the plot, swiss cheesy holes throughout. That said, I kept forgetting that was Kristen Wiig, she owned this role, she was Maxine. Ricky Martin's character of Robert was so rich and multifaceted, considering the material they were working with. The writing is soapy, but infectious like a pop song, I couldn't help myself, I had to see the next episode. Carol Burnett is a goddess, I loved her plot twisty character. It was silly, it was fun, my eyes ache to see those costumes again. It gets 9 because when I finished it, I started it again to see what I missed, and in my opinion, that's the ultimate hallmark of a great show.",literal
"Quirky Good I was late arriving to this very off-beat series (this month!) and it took me a couple of episodes to get the rhythms, but once in, I binge-watched to the end of Season 3.

Gary Oldman (Jackson Lamb) steals every scene he's in and the entire series. If Mick Herron, who wrote the book upon which this series is based, didn't have Oldman in mind, you'd never know it.

Reportedly, showrunner Will Smith did have Jack Lowden in mind to play 'River Cartwright' and too right he was. Lowden is pitch perfect as the very complicated character he inhabits.

Kristin Scott Thomas (Diana Taverner), Samuel West (Peter Judd), and Sophie Okonedo (Ingrid Tearney) play characters we have seen many times before, but they play them very well.

Along for the ride is Jonathan Pryce (David Cartwright) but they don't give him enough to do. I would involve him more.

The final two episodes of Season 3 devolved into French farce and frustrating stupidity and thickness, otherwise, my rating might have been an 8. But I look forward to Season 4, which I read will debut in late Fall.",literal
"deceptively easy-going Real world satire combined with most enjoyable video game elements, and the final result is the show that deals with complex, serious matters, where there's no true good guys nor bad guys, because regardless of all, eveyone is convinced that necessity dictates their actions and deeds.

All that being covered under game style quest and roles, can prompt one to dig a bit deeper, and if do, then to figure how things are.

Sort of unique show.",literal
"A Very Enjoyable Mystery Movie My husband and I saw this pre-release as the ""mystery movie"" at our local theater and both enjoyed it. The actors did a great job and you really felt like the young characters were the actual younger version of the senior characters. It had an enjoyable plot that kept you laughing and interested to find out how it would end the entire time. In the end, we were happy with the final ending :)",literal
"A masterpiece unbound! Firstly, hitting the negative as I found the prelude/exposition lengthy and slowly-paced. My fault, have just picked copy of shelf to reread and see what I was missing!

Thereafter, was transfixed by all aspects of this tour-de-force gothic roller-coaster!

Sets, costumes, locations, effects and performances all excel and are as far from Ham-it-up Horror as you can get- much as I love them!

Elordi's 'monster' engages and dominates throughout with some erotic subtext that I'd never noticed before! Hope that's not just me!

Now want to revisit 'Pan's Labyrinth' again as well as 'Chronos' and 'Devil's Backbone'!

It's a long film but worth every minute!",figurative
"Tulsa Botox Season one is pretty good, but season two went down a steep slope. This is not a realistic gangster show - more like a silly and very entertaining show. At least season one is.

Stallone is as expected, we all know what we're getting. The rest of the cast is a mixed bag. The character called Bodhi, is really well done. The guy playing Stallones driver is just plain annoying.

Then we have the Ranch Lady - who's gone all in on botox. What people want to do to their faces, is their own business. But when you work as an actress, it's not ideal to have the same facial expression in every scene. Stallones real life daughter, playing the stable girl, has also gone and made her face look like the blonde girl from the Muppet Show.

Season two was a real mess, but unfortunately season one doesn't stand alone very well, due to the way it ends.

Season one 8 Season two 4.",literal
"My low expectations turned into pleasant surprise At first glance,""Wednesday"" appears to be a very high-end glossy production, but I am skeptical because I do not see the need to redo the character of Wednesday after Christina Ricci has perfected it in the 90s. Then to my surprise, Christina Ricci is part of this cast which implies that she gives her stamp of approval. I only know Jenna Ortega from ""You"" in 2019 as a bratty mouthy teenager; I do not have high hopes but I want to give her a chance, and oh yes she delivers! Ortega should be commended for carrying the show throughout. That is not an incidental accomplishment, rather an expectation and she easily meets it. Wednesday is emotionless yet you cannot take your eyes off her face. Emma Myers as Enid is also wonderful. We find ourselves a couple of young actresses to watch and root for in the future. The dialogue here is witty, highlighting the biting one-liners uttered by Wednesday in rapid-fire fashion. Then we have the beautiful cinematography accompanied by a rich soundtrack. The twists and turns are also done well. Finally, a decent show that is both dark and feel-good to come out of Netflix! Dahmer this is not.",literal
"Regretting You I could tell from the trailer and the credits, including director Josh Boone (The Fault in Our Stars, The New Mutants) and being based on the book by Colleen Hoover (It Ends with Us), that it was likely to be a ""weepie"" or depressing; despite low critical reviews, I was willing to give it a chance. Basically, it opens with a flashback of the early 2000s, with teenaged Morgan (M3GAN's Allison Williams), her boyfriend Chris (Scott Eastwood), her younger sister Jenny (Willa Fitzgerald) and her boyfriend Jonah (Dave Franco), a tight-knit group of friends in the late 2000s, preparing to graduate high school and listening to ""When You Were Young"" by The Killers. They seemed like mismatched couples, with Morgan and Jonah closer to each other. The night they were partying, Morgan became pregnant. Seventeen years later, Morgan and Chris are middle-aged with teenage daughter Clara Grant (Ghostbusters: Afterlife's Mckenna Grace) who is preparing for college, while Jenny and Jonah are married with a baby son, Elijah (twins William Burnham Simmons and Ryan Conner Simmons). Clara has a crush on local bad boy Miller Adams (The Black Phone's Mason Thames), who may or may not already have a girlfriend. One day, whilst driving, she sees him at the side of the road, and reverses to pick him up. He asks her to help him carry the Dylan city limit road sign back to its rightful place, explaining that he often moves it to be within the delivery radius to order pizzas. Driving him home, Miller introduces Clara to his apparently grumpy grandpa Hank ""Gramps"" (Clancy Brown), who is going through chemotherapy for cancer. Jenny receives a call from Clara telling her about Miller, unaware that she is on speaker with her mother listening. Clara treats Jenny as a mother figure. The four adults have lunch together to celebrate Morgan's birthday, with Clara and her school friend Lexie (Sam Morelos). They talk about Miller and his troubled past, including being arrested for dealing drugs and his father being in prison. The following day, Lexie tells Clara that Miller's girlfriend, Shelby, broke up with him, although later they supposedly get back together. Then, Morgan and Jonah arrive at the hospital after receiving calls and receive the devastating news that Jenny and Chris have been killed together in a car accident; Chris was driving Jenny's car. Clara is heartbroken at losing her father and her aunt. Miller meets her outside after she walks out of her father's funeral, feeling overwhelmed. Morgan catches them in his car and is upset finding out that Clara was smoking marijuana he got for her. Jonah visits Morgan that night, and they go looking for Chris's car, while Clara visits Miller at the cinema where he works. Finding the car at a hotel, Morgan realises Chris and Jenny were having an affair, which Jonah may have already known about. Morgan insists Clara cannot know about the affair because it would destroy her memories of both her father and aunt. Later that night, Jonah returns with Elijah and hands him to Morgan, saying he cannot deal with the fact that the baby may not be his. Two days later, Clara visits Jonah and tells her to come back for his son and cleans his house, which has become messy. Jonah returns to collect Elijah and apologises to him. Clara goes to see Miller again, and he tells her that he broke up with his girlfriend, admitting he had been hiding feelings for Clara, and they share their first kiss. Miller is a film obsessive and has ambitions to go to college to study filmmaking. Jonah visits Morgan and plays her the song ""Dakota"" by the Stereophonics, and she recalls hearing the song whilst they were teenagers. A flashback reveals that Morgan and Jonah shared a near-intimate moment in a swimming pool together. During rehearsals for a school play, Miller tries to connect Lexie with his friend and co-worker, the nerdy Efren (Ethan Costanilla). While Clara goes to the cinema with Miller, Morgan and Jonah find love letters written between Chris and Jenny. They cheer themselves up by throwing eggs at and damaging a Tiffany's painting that Chris liked, but she hated. Jonah confesses that his hatred for Watermelon Jolly Ranchers was not real; he always saved them for her, and he admits that he has always regretted not telling her he had feelings for her. Morgan insists that things have changed, and she must put Clara first. But Jonah says Jenny was unfaithful, and he cannot let the betrayal of his wife and his best friend dictate the rest of his life, and Morgan shouldn't either. At a private screening of Clueless, Clara and Miller are kissing, but she tells him she is a virgin and wants to wait until prom night if they are going to have sex. Morgan later messages Jonah that they need to talk, and she instinctively kisses him. Clara walks in as they are kissing and is devastated. In anger, Clara messages Miller to come over after work and to bring a condom. But as they start to have sex, Miller realises she is not truly ready, seeing her crying because of what has happened. He realises she is using him to get back at her mother, angered, he is about to leave, but seeing Clara upset, agrees to stay with her until she falls asleep. The next morning, the day Clara is turning seventeen, Morgan is shocked to find Miller in bed with Clara. At school, Clara invites Miller to her birthday celebration. Jonah, a teacher at the school, tries to talk to Clara, but she refuses to listen. Clara is joined by Miller and Lexie, insisting he will stay, and Jonah arrives, and she tells him to stay as well. During the awkward dinner, Clara and Morgan argue over their relationship choices, and Clara reveals she has been accepted into the UNCSA (University of North Carolina School of the Arts) drama program. Miller leaves in a huff, while Lexie gives Clara some alcohol, and they visit Jenny's gravestone; Lexie reveals she and Efren are dating. The following morning, Morgan and Clara talk. Morgan finally reveals that her father and aunt were having an affair, and that the kiss between her and Jonah was the first and only time. Clara asks if she regrets her choices, and Morgan insists that she is the best thing in her life and has no regrets. Clara tells her mother that she deserves to be happy, hinting that she and Jonah can be together. Clara apologises to Miller for everything, telling him that he has a lot to tell her. Clara and Miller reconcile at the cinema, while Morgan visits Jonah and confesses that they should have been together all along. Morgan and Jonah burn the love letters and have sex. One month later, Miller has arranged a movie night for everyone. He tells them all he has been accepted into film school, he says he will defer to look after Gramps, but his grandfather tells him he has enough money to pay for his tuition. Miller then plays a film he made featuring several moments he recorded of Clara, including her stage performances and his proposal asking her to the prom, which she accepts. Morgan then talks to Clara and tells her to follow her passion. It ends with Clara and Miller moving the road sign to order a pizza. Also starring Luke Pierre Roness as Hank Adams Jr., Daniel Smith as the Pastor, Marcelle LeBlanc as Tonya, Kurt Yue as the Doctor, and Aubrey Brockwell as young Clara. Williams is pretty good as the widowed woman coping with the revelations, Grace is well cast as the rebellious teenager emotionally broken, Thames is equally pleasant as the boy she fancies, but I agree Franco is not the most convincing as the love interest that never was for the lead. This film is clearly targeted at a specific audience, those easily charmed by mawkish material; it may have themes about loss, grief, personal sacrifice, and unreciprocated love, but it doesn't quite reach the level of a tearjerker or being meaningful; it certainly isn't rubbish, I found it a reasonable romantic drama. Worth watching!",literal
"Byrne emerges from a world determined to break her Rose Byrne gives us an emotionally charged, no-holds barred performance as Linda in If I Had Legs I'd Kick You. It's obvious from the first scene that Linda is running on fumes - she's drained of energy and running in circles. She feels invisible. And then the roof falls in. Literally. A giant piece of her bedroom ceiling, along with a torrent of water, collapses into her home, leaving a gaping, bizarre, somewhat mystical hole above the bed, while also flooding the unit. So Linda and her daughter relocate to an unnamed beachside hotel in an anonymous city, to await reconstruction.

Linda is a professional therapist, in dire need of therapy for herself. She listens to others, yet no one in her life listens to her. ""You're not listening to me"" is Linda's oft-repeated statement. She's surrounded by people who ignore her. The therapist/associate she sees semi-professionally (Conan O'Brien) has so removed himself from caring about her feelings that he isn't given a name in the film. He shuts the door on her face. There are hints of a shared past, an unprofessional personal relationship. Now he is not even pretending to listen to her. He's frequently antagonistic and is extremely unlikeable.

Her daughter (Delaney Quinn), also nameless, but we'll call 'Child', lives with a chronic medical condition. Child has a feeding tube inserted in her stomach and sleeps hooked to an ever-beeping monitor. Child's face is never seen; we only get glimpses of her ear, toes, stomach and the back of her head. Yet she's heard constantly. Always anxious, whining about everything and never listening to what Linda tells her to do. The audience definitely wishes Linda would stop deferring to Child; it becomes exhausting and makes Linda look even more invisible. Linda is also consumed with guilt about Child's condition. ""It's my fault"" is Linda's self-diagnosis. Maybe it's because she was present when Child's tube was first inserted, and, as her mother, as well as the continual 'victim' of other people's misbehavior toward her, this is how Linda views herself. 'Everything is my fault. I am invisible'.

Mary Bronstein performs triple duty in If I Had Legs I'd Kick You. Not only is she Child's physician, Dr. Spring, she is also the film's writer/Director. Dr. Spring certainly doesn't listen to Linda, especially about the feeding tube. Linda wants to remove it to see if Child will eat on her own; Dr. Spring won't even discuss it, pushing Linda's anxiety into overdrive. ""Maybe I doesn't know what's best for my own daughter."" More self-doubt.

The disembodied yet umistakeable voice of Christian Slater is Linda's husband, Charles. He's MIA from the marriage, probably for a very long time. He's in the military, but doesn't seem to be enlisting in anything more pressing than choosing to avoid his family and berate Linda at every opportunity. He's literally phoning it in; Linda frequently hangs up on him and then apologizes. Self-loathing.

Linda has patients who enlist her services as a therapist. Occassionally they DO listen to her, but only to nurture their own delusional behaviors. One of them physically disappears during a session, abandoning her toddler with Linda. Even the woman at the hotel's mini mart ignores her when she goes in to purchase some wine. The only person who pays any sort of attention to her is James (A$AP Rocky), her hotel neighbor. He sees her, maybe the first person in a long time who does so. He listens to her. His performance provides some needed comic relief in the film, and gives Linda a semi-sane person to relate to.

If I Had Legs I'd Kick You is populated with many intentionally unlikeable characters. Bronstein explores how women can unintentionally become invisible even to themselves, losing who they are while trying to accommodate everyone else's demands. Yet she bookends her film with images of water drenching our soul-drowned protagonist, clearly symbolizing Linda's need for an emotional cleansing. The washing away of years of mental sludge buildup. There is also an unmistakeable analogy between the hole in the ceiling and Child's stoma; dealing with each further debilitates Linda to the point of inaction.

Though I enjoyed the film for the most part, I believe with one change, the film could have been truly remarkable. That change - eliminate the physical character of Child. You rarely see her, you only hear her. If you see the film, consider this option: Child no longer exists. She has already passed away. Yet the audience doesn't know that till the end. The character now lives solely in Linda's ragged mind. In that case, Byrne's performance, and the film, would have been mind-blowing. With so much of the film steeped in anonymity, with invisibility, it would have made the plot all the more unforgettable. A different take on ""I see dead people"", and we know how influential, movie-wise, that reveal was for Bruce Willis and Director M. Knight Shyamalan.",figurative
"Why I Give The Rookie Ten Stars For those who say good major network drama is dead, ABC comes out swinging with ""The Rookie"". The show title indicates that it is about a middle-aged man's effort to become a cop, but it's actually so much more than that. The show presents a believable and generally positive backstage to those men and women who dedicate themselves to keeping the rest of us safe. I love the mixed character chemistry. To show my point, so far my favorite character isn't even Nathan Fillion who has the leading ticket. Mine is actually his T.O. (""Training Officer"") played by Afton Williamson, attractive and smart. So let's run the list:

 Positive social message: check.

Engaging, coherent and fun storyline: check.

High quality, smart and witty script: check.

Top notch cast and acting: check.

Likeable, relatable character ensemble: check.

Positive female and male multiracial roles presented: check.

Decent background research: check.

Good directing, sound and music: check.

Is it good entertainment? ABSOLUTELY

 I can be a critical TV viewer, often saying to myself what I would do better, what I would change. The more I find myself having this kind of discussion with myself, the worse the show. What would I change about the Rookie? NOTHING AT ALL. Ten Stars.",literal
"Dissapointment Why do I feel every new movie became a parody? And to be honest, a really bad one.

Outside of a few funny scenes, this movie was a big dissapointment. Acting and visual effects are not that bad, but other than that I can't find a light spot in anything; there is a lot of mixed and unexplained stuff, happening for no reason for the movie plot, comedy parts are naive and not really on the level of such a title. I watched it in 3D and even visual effect were really bad, did not feel like it was made for 3D at all. All in all, a big dissapointment and would not recommend watching it.",literal
"Meh Started off interesting and then went downhill and crash landed at the bottom of a ski slope.

The story doesn't really grip you and the acting is average though Dominic Cooper tries hard (but not enough).

"Breaking Bad is the best television show ""Breaking Bad"" is the best television show. Ever.

We start out with one main character, Walter White (played by Bryan Cranston), who is struggling to make ends meet working both as a high school chemistry teacher and part time at a car wash. Then he gets diagnosed with cancer. Then he breaks bad.

Teaming up with an unlikely sidekick, Jesse Pinkman (played by Aaron Paul), who is the immature ""yo, bitch""-spouting, high-school-screw-up small-time drug dealer, Walt and Jesse both put their skills towards the drug world to try to make good by their families.

This show has been masterfully put together with layer upon layer of insight into some of the most interesting characters ever realized in the history of television. We have some very dark characters, and a lot of grey characters, and it all adds up to brilliant dialogue and plot lines.

The creator, writers, directors and actors have paid attention to every single detail, putting thought into every nuance in every character in every scene. Because of this attention to detail there is something for everyone in this show. Every thinking brain will immediately be attracted to the intelligence so evidently on display, that even if you're not a drug dealing chemist living in Albuquerque, you will find something in the characters that connects you to them and makes you hang on for dear life.

Get on your couch now and start watching ""Breaking Bad"" from the very beginning, and don't miss a single scene.",literal
"TBBT is really past its prime I love the early episodes, because that's the heart of the show, the hilarious interaction by the brilliant, yet socially inept young nerds and the earthy Penny and the rest of the world of the 'normals'.

IMO, TBBT died when Howard Wolowitz got married and Sheldon was matched up with Amie. Not only is she terribly homely, but rarely funny, where I am concerned. I'd rather watch mold grown on wallpaper than Amie's clumsy attempts to out-Sheldon Sheldon and to fit in and make up for a screwed-up childhood. The taming of the aloof and indifferent to women Sheldon was a sad event in this series. All the really nerdy stuff, idiosyncrasies, tensions, and fun left, when Howard was brought down to earth by that lovely little Biologist,his mother substitute, and when Rajesh received his little dog, since he lost Howard. What a fun and delightfully weird relationship that was. Especially when analyzed and crushed occasionally by Leonard's equally damaged scientist mom. All gone. They should have kept Raj's impediment, his inability to speak to girls. Whenever I see those new girls show up, I lose interest, because I know it will be not what the series was all about, nerd wars. Now it has become sort of a 'chick flick' series. Bringing in Bob Newhart was excellent, and works great with just the four guys and Penny. All the other stuff is really beside the point and outside the brilliance of the original premise of the show. I think CBS should have told the actors to forget the $1M per episode and enjoy their fame and what they already have and whatever they will get from reruns and spin-off goods. Game over. Sadly, I think it's now the (Asian - huge success over there, in those male-dominated societies) female watchers who drive the ongoing success of the story, finding their own verification in the subjugation of every one of those formerly free and crazy, goofy, and, in their own way, manly spirits. All that's left, for the likes of me, is to treasure the original intent of the show and enjoy the reruns.",figurative
"Really Funny If you just wanna have some fun, laugh and enjoy with your family, then I recommend this movie for you. I watched it with my friends after a hard day at work and it is really made my day and let me forget all the work.

"Trash. Retold 3 times. Zero Ending. For anyone wondering if this is any good, it's not. I was hoping for something along the lines of Sum of All Fears type of a movie with Bigelow as the director.

Turns out, it's the same 16 min missile launch window told by one perspective. Then another from the beginning, then a third perspective.

Nobody seems to have any clue what to do, fire an intercept missile and then no back up plan. Entirely lame.

Even the President's point of view is shown and he is clueless. He has 2 minutes to act, and calls his wife on an African safarii and guess what, the call breaks up.

Then the movie ends and the credits roll. Complete Sopranos ending. No impact, fake missile or not, no resolution or decision made. Incredibly poor. 1/10 is too much.",literal
"Low Stakes Entertainment As a fan of ""The Office"" and ""Superstore,"" it was a no brainer to start watching this show. Is it as good as those? Not yet. Does it have potential? Sure, but so did ""American Auto,"" which only lasted two weeks. As the weeks go on, I find myself increasingly appreciating the characters. Unlike the three previous shows, this is my first time watching outside of the binge-streams, so I anticipate the next week's episode. Long story short, it's funny, light-hearted entertainment. It's one of those shows that you don't necessarily have to invest in. It's not going to change your life, but it won't subtract from it either. If you like comedy, especially workplace comedy, then you won't be disappointed. Enjoy!",literal
Cast The cast has brought this show to life. Adian Turner is absolutely an awesome actor!!!!! NO ONE could play the part the way he has done. NO ONE!!!!!!!! I'm in love with Ross. :) Ellenor has caused us all to fall in love with Demelza. Again NO ONE could do a better job!!!! They make it so real.They have a chemistry that works great. I think all the cast is the perfect for each part. Hats off to whomever picked them. Gotta say LOVE LOVE LOVE Prudie and Jud!!!! Beaty and Phil please don't leave the show. Jake Farling does such a good job that I cannot stand George. And Hielda Reed as well sometimes I like Elizebeth but now after episode 8 I can't stand her. Hielda is doing an awesome job. :) I hope you go longer than 5 seasons. Keep up the good work. And PLease Luke Norris don't leave the show. I think Dr. Dwight as well as all mentioned should stay for the duration. I hated it when Frances/ Kyle Soller died. And Gabriella Wilde brings a interesting personality.I would like to see more of I hope Caroline stays on the show as well and is given a bigger part. I would also like to see more of Verity and her husband more. OK just saying. I just wish it was longer than 8 episodes each season and very happy that there are 10 this season. I would have croaked if it had ended for the season the way it ended in season 2 episode 8. I have read the books and I much prefer the liberties taken on the show. Gotta say the stocking scene was steaming hot.,literal
"Mixture It's like mix of Avatar, Star Wars, Transformers, Alien and Avengers and also Gremlins and maybe PlayStation Game Abe Oddworld. It wasn't sooo bad but it should not be called Predator. Elle Fanning is like Bishop in aliens but both of her characters were ok. The most annoying things in this movie were the face of the Predator. It looked sad and desperate and like some avatar. His character was too human. And also the small blue monkey with eyes like Gizmo and personality like the Pug in Disneys Pocahontas.

I think Billy Bob Thornton is amazingly talented, but really, in this role he is just over the top. It think it's the script. His language isn't gritty. It's gross. Sometimes people just talk. They don't spit out crude one liners, one after the other. I know jaded. This character isn't jaded, it's a pastiche, someone's idea of jaded.

And the women. Is there only one type of woman in that community? Do they all run around in short shorts and bra tops? Do they all have long blonde hair and three inch nails. Another pastiche. Another script error. Where are the people in this show? Where are the relatable characters?

I watched the trailer after I walked out of the first episode. The trailer suggests a good story. Where is that story? If I were a writer, I wouldn't put my name to that script.

As for Billy Bob Thornton...I'm sure he's doing his best with what he's been given, but even he can't redeem this show.",literal
"Nice movie ""Bugonia"" is a satirical, absurdist sci-fi dark comedy directed by Yorgos Lanthimos from a screenplay by Will Tracy. It's an English-language remake of the 2003 South Korean cult film Save the Green Planet! . The film stars Emma Stone (as Michelle, a powerful pharmaceutical CEO), Jesse Plemons (as Teddy, a conspiracy-obsessed beekeeper), alongside Aidan Delbis, Stavros Halkias, and Alicia Silverstone . The story follows two conspiracists who kidnap Michelle, convinced she is an alien threatening Earth .",literal
"Needs a bit more medical input which could add to the humor. And relevannce. I would love to contribute stories/scripts for your show. It's not just that I live in Oregon. Its mostly that I worked 25 years as an Orthopedic Spine Surgeon and I have lots of funny stories. And educational. Funny and educational in a good way.

Let me know hear if you want to discuss further. I truly thing I can conrtribute a good bit. People tell me I have a good sense of humor. And I try to be soulful. I do think I could bring a lot to your team.

I'm trying to make my review long enough to get your attention. I can totally help your team. My main qualification is that I am a funny and somewhat verbose guy. I am also a retired Spine Surgeon after 25 years in practice. I have many funny stories.

And I am a terrible negotiator. I would wish to be paid but I would not say that is my priority.

"Original French Version The original French version, Haut Potential Intellectuel, was much smarter. The first episode was virtually the same as this first episode except they left off the first part where it is established that she lacks patience with people she talks to. This was at an employment she had besides working as a cleaning person at the police department. She gets fired from that job for disrespecting the customer. After that missing scene the rest of the first episode was basically the same. The biggest difference is the main character, Morgan, who is far more quirky than the one depicted in the American version. After watching the original version it is extremely difficult not to compare. This could be as entertaining because I do like Kaitlin Olsen. I'm hoping the character she had in The Mick who was irreverent and funny shows up in future episodes.",literal
The Rating says it all I saw Emmy Rossum's interview with Chelsea Handler & decided to give it a watch. My hopes weren't that high because the USA hasn't done too good a job of bring UK shows over and keeping everything that made them great in the UK. This show demolishes that stereotype. The characters of Veronica and Kevin are definitely the funniest characters on the show. Frank's character makes you hate him to the core but not enough to destroy the show. Fiona is the one you all love and hate you love her for everything she does but sometimes hate her for some of her decisions she makes them for the good of the family not necessarily for the good of herself which isn't what we've come to expect from TV. This show is just amazing & is killing me for making me have to wait until 2012 for season 2.,literal
"Great I really loved it.

Needing to be continued and show us more about the story The morgan character is so ginues ans smart to habe in a show This show also reminds me of the poker face but with an open ending.

Pleaseeeeeeeeeeee don't let us this way and make the next season tooooooo I'm so confused about what happened to roman and what will happen with morgan.

Karadak character is sooo nice and gentelman I love him but I don't like the match whit that cleaning boy.

It made me laugh and I finished watching it in 3 days I couldn't stop thinking about the story and it was so exiting Something like the lucifer.",literal
"Epic Fail This show had plenty potential that is wasted. The daughter storyline is just god-awful. The chauvinistic attitude of all the men to prove women are incapable of being in charge is an overly used storyline that just makes zero sense. The cop with the family full of delinquents, etc. Just doesn't work. I started watching Fire Country and stopped in the middle of the second season because of the trite storyline. I did not know this show was an extension of it, but now it makes sense. Both suck. They cancel good shows but keep garbage like this on air.",literal
"Very enjoyable! These days, shows that have a slightly different angle, and do it well, are few and far between. This, though, is a really enjoyable show. The storylines are interesting, it's shot in some great locations and the acting is pretty good. Particularly from Justin Hartley, who comes across really well.

The supporting cast do a good job and they all fit together well. There's the bonus of some good actors popping up, from other shows, in guest roles.

As another bonus, the soundtrack has some pretty good songs in it, too. I am glad it got a second season and I hope it survives the annual network cull, where being a good show isn't often enough to ensure survival.",literal
"Dude whatttt so good. Okay whattttt?! I was not expecting this to be that good. But I was hooked immediately. The whole production is so good. I only wish Netflix had released it in October because it would be so perfect for Halloween. Tim Burton is a phenomenal director, and every cast member is perfect for their roles. Jenna plays Wednesday so well, I saw an interview where she spoke about taking direction from Burton. You can tell she really enjoyed playing the character, and her commitment shows on screen. The ""high school"" Netflix show trope has run its course so many times before, it feels stale, but this is so obviously different and fresh.",literal
1 season was enough It was a good first season with some good character building. It dwindled a bit in the middle and became a tad boring. I had high expectations from what I had heard about it. It did pick up near the end but the conclusion to the first season wasn't all that rewarding or satisfying. Maybe too predictable at times. Martin Short kept me watching for the most part as he offered the most with his comedy. I did not have much of an urge to start the second season but I still did give it a go. Then I saw Michael Rappaport and Amy Schumer in the first episode and I had an easy choice to turn it off and give up on it.,literal
"Drama, Comedy and drugs (Season 2) Nurse Jackie is one of the most intelligent TV series, intriguing, at times dramatic and funny, but above all that it's an incredibly well-acted series, Edie Falco is extraordinary, I have always loved, especially since The Sopranos and now as a nurse addicted to drugs yes that's true.

Speaking of performances, has a cast including Peter Facinelli first the same as ""Twilight."" Showtime is doing brilliantly to keep renewing this great series.

I can not wait until 2011 to see season 3, is too long to wait, hopefully they will premiere much earlier to keep enjoying this great series.",literal
"Season 2 is a let down Season 1 was really engaging and different from the usual series. I escpecially liked Keri Russell's slightly awkward and imperfect portrayal of the ambassador, and the chemistry with Rufus Sewell is off the charts.

Season 2 is were it really starts to go wrong. The plot gets more ludicrous than the average american thriller series and has more holes than a thick wedge of emmentaler cheese. I can handle a certain amount of stupid decision making by characters, but the level of imbicility a lack of any reasoning at the top level of american and british goverment makes this hard to watch. Perhaps because it comes to close to reality.",literal
"One show worth watching every week!!! I started watching when I noticed Missy P was part of the cast. It's enlightening to view crime from the standpoint of the FBI It's helped turn my somewhat anti-establishment view of typical cops and crime fighters. Great story lines, wonderfully convincing cast even when life-changing hurdles arise. I cannot tell you how GREAT it is to see Muslims depicted in positive ways. Not to mention how attractive and ghost-like presence of Mr Zeeko! Being tall,dark,handsome and classy- what's not to like?!",literal
"An outstanding action movie The Running Man is everything a film should be. It has copious amounts of violence, plenty of one-liners and a clever storyline. Arnie plays his usual type of character, the badass strongman up against the system. Running Man was made in the late 80s, one of the glory eras for action films. Back then, violence counted, and in this film there is more than enough to keep you entertained. There are plenty of highlights, but the best scene is probably when Arnie chainsaws his enemy, a rather fat and sweaty 'chaser' between the legs. Suffice to say, said 'chaser' does not enjoy the experience...... Other highs include the big shootout at the end, when Arnie leads a small Army of computer geeks into battle with his trademark cigar taking pride of place in his mouth. Richard Dawson is superb as the sleazy game show host Killion, and his tete-a-tete with Arnie at the end is excellent! The music is your typical 80s pumping rock and suits the tone of the film very well. Of course the writers are assuming that in the future there will be a huge 80s revival, but there you go.... This is certainly one of Arnie's best outings. Its just a shame that today's movies are so tame. They would do well to replicate Running Man's levels of action.",literal
"Weekend binge but forgettable Wasn't awful. Could it have been shorter? Absolutely. Plot holes? Also yes.

But for a mindless bed rot weekend watch, it does the job. Got excited on Sunday night when I realised I had two episodes left to watch with my pie and mash, so that's a win.

If I had an actual watchlist, this would be bottom tier, but honestly? There's nothing on TV right now, so here we are.",literal
"Interesting storyline and decent acting I just finished the first season of Tracker and this show has promise. I enjoy the different weekly cases and supporting characters that help Shaw in his mission. I also find the overarching mystery of Shaw's father and family interesting, but I wish they would've given us more info this season.

Also, I wish they'd give us the background on the lesbian couple (without getting ideological) who help Shaw find cases each week. What is their experience, expertise, and credentials that give them the ability to do this job? Has Shaw always worked with them or did he do this job solo when he started? How'd he meet them? How'd they get started? What drives them to do this job above any other? The characters of these two women are hollow and one dimensional. They just seem like a couple of groupie randos who randomly scour the net for cases.

We've gotten background on all of the other characters except these two women. Providing a deep background on them, as well as a little more screen time will allow us to connect more with their characters and actually care what happens to them and how they do their job. Have they ever dropped the ball and let Shaw down? Have any of the bad guys ever tracked them down and threatened their safety in order to distract Shaw? Do they ever struggle to find information for Shaw? Addressing these questions in season two and beyond will make for a much deeper and interesting story.",literal
Forest Whitakers daughter ruins it Nepotism has to stop. It needs to. She is ugly and weighing down the beautiful cast. She is a bad actor. I cringe when she is on screen.

"Fails at basically every level Maslany is fabulous in this movie. And unfortunately that is just about the only good thing one can say about it. The film is painfully boring - largely because it is so heavy handed it telegraphs all of its beats. The script is shockingly amateur, with characters so thin cellophane would be jealous. It doesn't bother to even try to make sense of its woefully underdeveloped concept. The couple at the center of the story has less than zero chemistry - and even maslany's magnetism can't bail out her dead weight scene partner. You are way ahead of the script from the very beginning, and yet the thing plot still manages to be confusing. And not in a good way. The movie has a handful of compelling shots, but mostly is filled with dutch angle dead space that fails to raise tension or mystery. And even if you did manage to buy into the tension - you'd feel stupid for doing so, as the entire mystery is explained in one scene or one monologue rather. This is a movie that leaves you asking why? Not only why was this made but why did I waste the last two hours of my life watching it.",figurative
"Brilliantly written and produced, the characters and actors are amazing This is up there as one of my top 5 series ever to date. Each episode is brilliantly delivered and each season just gets better and better, it just sucks you in! The characters and acting is superb, one moment you hate someone and then the next they're your favourite. The storyline itself is so immersive, twists and turns and always edge of your seat action, great writing overall that's keeps you coming back for more. I'm actually at a loss of what to watch next as anything similar just seems inferior. In some aspect I wish they could continue after season 6 but all great things must come to an end unfortunately.",literal
"No, thanks So, Star Wars, Alien, and now Predator. Three franchises run into the ground. Alien became a teen movie, and now the Predator has daddy issues. To the reviewers who start by saying 'I've watched all the Predator movies'-we know what that really means. Back to the review: nobody wants to relate to the Predator. I don't need to understand its motives or its struggles. I need to fear it. I need some mystery. This new breed of writers has to inject their little life dramas into everything, even into a character like the Predator. Textbook narcissism. There's no tension, no consequences, and yes, another insufferable protagonist. They just keep them coming. If you enjoy this, you probably don't like the original Predator. This is comic book Predator for people who think the world is so awful that escapism means nothing can have weight or stakes anymore.",literal
"Good but... I like it.. but what I didnt like is the attack on Christianity in some scenes.. half way through felt like she was doing the most and a lot of people around her had to deal with consequences and she still living like she's a victim, a lot of things were normalized which I dnt think they should be especially for teenagers! Other than that nt so bad its good actually.",literal
"Watchable. But uneven and highly derivative. Intriguing first episode. Way downhill second episode. (That Indian mother was a terrible actor and her character made no sense. Most of those new humans were poorly written characters.)

And Why wouldn't the main character who has some brains ask the aliens the most obvious question:

""Once we're all ""you"", then what?""

What's their goal? They're only behaving like humans for the sake of making the last humans comfortable. Ok. Then what?

It's a mildly diverting show. But it's full of plot holes and literally every scene has more or less been done before.

"One-Punch Dude A new perspective in the Japanese Anime. No mainstream characters, not a cliché story or plot, it has a great potential in becoming even better, personally I didn't read the manga(the comic) and in my opinion this anime show is really watchable and I recommend it to everyone no parental advisory, call them even and watch it together.

Saitama is very interesting character you'll never know what he is going to do next or when is he going to punch the opposer.

Don't hesitate and start watch this great show you won't be disappointed, and you'll thank anyone and everyone who made you watch it.",literal
"KPOP Idols + Kimetsu no Yaiba + Turning Red-esque Animation I enjoy listening to K-pop songs during my time, but I am also interested in animation. The visuals are very cool, but the songs, which were sung by TWICE, were too pop and catchy (I'm even listening to K-pop, J-pop, and P-pop).

The animation style reminds me of Disney's Turning Red and Hotel Transylvania, and the visuals were pretty aesthetic and make it cooler.

The animation mixed up K-Pop visual elements with fast-paced demon-slaying sequences. The animation style presents a combination of different elements. The K-Pop-inspired character designs succeed in capturing the energetic spirit of the three girls, but the animation production quality varies throughout the film.

This movie is going to be a TAKEDOWN to all of the fans of Huntrix! I gave it 100/10.",literal
"Overhyped It is a decent movie and definitely watchable but way too overhyped as if it's some literary art piece. The gist of the movie is a bunch of kids go missing and it follows the same couple of days over multiple perspectives. Some perspectives especially the earlier ones leave much to be desired. Also due to its nature some scenes are often repeated to no greater effect. I watched this in IMAX and there were a few audible groans during these scenes.

The ending is also WAY too cookie-cutter. Without spoiling anything nothing unexpected or thought worthy happens at the end. What I wanted was the movie to delve more into the occult and how 'that person' came to be and what they hoped to achieve. We should've gotten a perspective from that person where they just wreak havoc or have some backstory (missed opportunity).

Alas, it was one of the better movies I've seen in a while.",literal
"Pleasant surprise, amazing movie What an amazing movie, one of the best I watched this year!

As a Kpop fan I was worried I'd be disappointed, but it blew me away. They've done a fantastic job capturing the essence of Kpop. I laughed, I cried, I loved every moment.

It reminds me of Pixar at its best. The animation is so sleek and unique, the last time I was this amazed was with Arcane. The songs are really super catchy, and the French version is on point they did a really good job.

Even if you're not into Kpop, I highly recommend it you won't be disappointed.

Ps: Special shoutout to Jeongyeon, Chaeyoung, and Jihyo from TWICE, you girls did soooo great!",literal
"PG-13? A predator movie with PG-13 is an automatic 1/10. What in the actual F is going on? What's next? Terrefier 5 with PG-7? The director and studio should be ashamed of themselves. The very essence or Predator is, its a gory alien movie. PG rating changes the whole dynamic of the movie, the language, the scenes, the blood, the context, the violence. This is nothing but a cashgrab and people should not go see it for that reason. Deadpool proved you make more money with a rated R movie, but the suits want to play it safe with old data and wrong information. Best would be to make two versions of every movie. One PG for children and one Rated R - 18 for adults. That way they would make the maximum ammount of money...",literal
"Interesting premise and good action. The show is compentent enough at story telling. There is enough intrigue to make you want to know what is behind it all and what are the intentions behind some of the characters. There are also sub plots carried behind the main story so that is also a good thing. The fight choreography is really good and the action is entertaining enough. I would recommend to watch this show. It is good and entertaining, however just shy of being great. That's why I give it an 8/10.",literal
So beautiful! Such an incredible and beautiful and powerful story. The acting and performance has were incredible and the story is just remarkable. I'm super confused as to how anyone could not have enjoyed it. It's so relatable... we've all been through things we thought we couldn't get over and that is the story this movie tells. Absolutely loved it. Read the book too!,literal
"Oscar caliber masterpiece I love Del Toro and still this exceeded my expectations. What a truly beautifully drawn piece of art. The direction,the writing,the acting...perfection. This is by far the best movie I've watched the last decade. Kudos to Jacob Elordi, his performance was soul touching. Like the novel, it asks why people become monsters and this is exactly what makes it a close adaptation to the core of the book, to its soul. For a 2.5 hours the pace was pretty immaculate. LOVED IT and I'm so happy this is the year of goth romance renaissance..",figurative
"Look no further - this is it Looking for excitement? Drama? Top actors? Great script? Stop looking. Task is the series for you!

This is written before the last two episodes are finished, but I'm sure. You have to watch this one. In this excellent TV series, you will be entertained from the very beginning.

The best thing about good crime is when the plot allows us to get to know the characters. Their history, lives and challenges. In Task, I think this is done exquisitely. The series lets us get to know the main characters, but it never comes at the expense of the tension that is constantly building. I am also fascinated by the fact that the series manages to give me as a viewer challenges too; we constantly have to decide on both ethical dilemmas and choices the characters in the series make. Here, the ""bad"" and the ""good"" are not unambiguous, but complex and complex. Just like life itself. This makes the series feel very authentic.

Bravo to everyone involved.",figurative
"Okayish but nothing more than that The White Lotus is a luxury resort in Hawaii. A new group of guests has just arrived: there's the newlyweds, the family - husband, wife, teenaged daughter and friend, teenaged son - and the solo middle-aged holidayer. Little do they know but their idyllic holiday will be marred by a tragedy.

I wasn't entirely sure what to expect with this series. On face value it seems intriguing enough and the high IMDB rating made me think it's worth a watch. After watching the first season I'm wondering how on Earth it got such a high rating.

It started very badly with a weak, irritating first episode. We are introduced to the main characters and almost everyone is incredibly irritating: the spoiled-brat daughter and friend, the vacuous, always-staring-at-phone son, the overcontrolling celebrity mother, the paranoid father, the hyper-anxious, high-maintenance, morose solo woman, the newlywed guy who is always looking for faults.

The only likeable character among the guests is Rachel Patton (Alexandra Daddario) but she too has her flaws.

Some of the characters do have a positive arc but for the most part they're quite unengaging. Any time Tanya McQuoid (Jennifer Coolidge) was in a scene I felt the urge to reach for the remote and fast forward.

The plot is largely quite dull too. Even once things start to develop I largely had a ""so what?"" reaction to events. There are some semi-decent sub-plots though.

It's not without its positives though. The resort manager, Armond (Murray Bartlett), is easily the most colourful character and pretty much the only character preventing this from being an ordeal. There are some good moments of humour, though these are few and far between. The cinematography and settings are fantastic, especially in 4K resolution.

Overall, it's not terrible but it's not good either. I struggled to decide between a 5 or a 6 before deciding that I liked it slightly more than I disliked it, so gave it a 6/10.",literal
"A Pretentious Swing That Misses the Mark Yorgos Lanthimos once again delivers a film that screams ""I'm different"" but struggles to provide any genuine cinematic pleasure. Bugonia feels like it was designed not for audiences, but for Academy voters and critics eager to praise anything that looks unconventional. Unfortunately, the result is a hollow piece of cinema that mistakes eccentricity for substance. Emma Stone, who has recently tied much of her career to Lanthimos's projects, risks undermining her own trajectory by continually participating in these overindulgent experiments. Instead of engaging storytelling, we're left with an absurd, self-conscious attempt at art that alienates the viewer and leaves little more than frustration in its wake.",figurative
"Violent Ends Between this and The Order (2024), I think it's safe to say I'm becoming the target audience for these gritty 90s crime dramas in Small Town, USA. So far, they're not anything special, but they don't need to be. I'll take 50 of these solid and consistent films over most things floating around out there.

We follow Billy Magnussen who plays Lucas Frost, an heir to a third of a family drug empire, as he deals with the aftermath of a terrible personal tragedy at the hands of his own estranged kin. Starting out as an honest man on his way out of the criminal world his family is steeped in, Lucas' need for revenge pushes him to a point of no return-hence, ""Violent Ends.""

I really like the idea of revenge on paper. Seeing justice carried out on bad people should be a slam dunk entertainment wise, but in practice, a delicate balance needs to be struck between satisfying retribution and keeping a grasp on the protagonist's good nature. This is why many revenge plots will go the route of ""forgiveness,"" which this film addresses, but even that conclusion can feel underwhelming at times. In this case, this subjective topic came across as a little too indulgent on the side of blood or an ""eye for an eye."" Do I think it would have been a better movie if Lucas had shown more restraint? Not particularly. All I know is that my empathy for Lucas was significantly lessened once he crosses a certain line. The reaction from the brother and mother point to this being the intended impact, but even so, the emotional resonance at the end can only reach so far after this point.

I was pleasantly surprised to see Kate Burton, who I enjoyed in NBC's Grimm (2011-2017), play the mother of Lucas and a cop, Darlene Woodley. Unfortunately, I felt they didn't use her to the full potential. Early on, her careful investigation into the inciting incident seemed like it was going to surpass Lucas' messier rush for justice and offer something to say about playing things straight despite seemingly easier options, but her subplot was delegated to uncovering a ""twist"" about the case that I personally saw coming. Her contribution of this information wasn't even really necessary either as it was actively being revealed just as she arrives with it.

I couldn't help but think about Sons of Anarchy (2008-2014), which, despite the benefit of multiple seasons of television to build upon, handles the exact ""brand"" of vengeance this film was targeting much better on many occasions. As for a movie comp, one of my favorites of last year, The Dead Don't Hurt (2024) reaches a similar conclusion but handles the aftermath of the revenge tastefully enough to make the whole ordeal feel earned, which this movie lacks a bit (although, the flashback was a really nice touch to close it out).

My favorite scene was probably when Lucas and his brother Tuck seek out Uncle Walt Frost, played really well by Ray McKinnon, in order to negotiate for a more ""rational"" justice. This plan ends terribly, of course, but it was surely entertaining to watch.

Other random thoughts: I enjoyed the ""rattlesnake"" analogy to describe Lucas and his situation. I found it odd how Lucas demanded so much out of Tuck despite caring about him and knowing what his involvement could mean for his family (until the very end when it was too late). I felt that Lucas' ""at least I'm doing something"" justification for his actions was weak, especially considering the seemingly decent job his mother was doing given how recent the incident was.

Between this and The Order, I would choose the latter for the star power. It turns out that really does matter.

"Switches Worth Flipping Twice A sequel that knows exactly what it wants to be: funny, lighthearted, and packed with nods to the first film - from the music to the return of familiar faces.

At its heart, it's about the parent/child relationship, handled with sincerity without ever dragging down the fun. The twist of having four people swap this time adds a fresh layer of chaos and originality.

It's good vibes from start to finish, delivering exactly what you came for: a feel-good comedy that makes for a genuinely good time.",literal
"Get to stepping. It's looked like an interesting premise from the trailers for a while, and good reviews convinced me to make the effort to see ""The Long Walk"". Whilst maybe a little too nihilistic for me to say that I really 'enjoyed' it, I would say that I thought it was good.

Financially struggling after an expensive war, The US has begun to run ""The Long Walk"". A volunteer from each state, selected at random, gets to participate in the competition, which sees the players walk, non-stop, day and night until there is only one left. They receive warnings if their speed goes below 3 mph and are executed, by the military if they're unable to catch up. The winner receives untold riches and the chance to make one wish to the totalitarian Government. Ray Garraty (Cooper Hoffman) meets Peter McVries (David Jonsson) at the starting line and they become friendly, eventually teaming with Hank Olson (Ben Wang) and Arthur Baker (Tyt Nyuot) and encouraging each other to continue during the tough times.

At the conclusion of my screening, another viewer loudly proclaimed that the film was rubbish and ""Just people walking for two hours"". Whilst I can't argue that there isn't a lot of walking in the film, I do think perhaps that they missed some of the metaphors of it, and if nothing else, several great performances at the heart of it. The film, and the mostly young cast, do really good job of making you care about each of them (even if it's not always positive) and it does become genuinely affecting when they start to fall. The gruesome visual effects help with this too. Hoffman and Jonsson in particular are really good. Judy Greer is exceptional too even if I still can't get used to the idea that she's an actress old enough to have a child of Garratys age.

I shan't feel the need to revisit the film very often, but I did think that it was really good.",literal
"Manufactured tension So, manufactured tension, that could've been resolved by just telling her very supportive bandmates? Meh.

Some jokes got a few giggles.

The songs, could've been fun if they had gone full on weird K pop and not American pop. It had potential, but it stuck to safe, and settled for slightly above average entertainment for kids.

The animations are very good, however, I'd rather rewatch The Incredibles than end up back here.

To be fair, i don't think this was made for me. So fair warning if you're a millennial guy like me thinking all the 10/10 reviews must be on to something and this could cure the wait for Spiderverse 3..",literal
"Put the team in team work 😂👍🏻 Oh so cringe. It feels more like a glossy ad campaign for ""empowered women in power suits"" than an actual series about lawyers. The whole thing plays out like a brand commercial for top female attorneys representing rich, hard-done-by wives and not in a clever way. It's shallow, try-hard, and completely misses any real emotional or sentimental punch.

The script is rough... painfully unnatural dialogue and zero chemistry between characters. And honestly? Kim wasn't the problem. She actually did fine... it's the writing that's embarrassing. What could've been smart, sharp, and uplifting ended up fake and hollow. So much potential... totally wasted.",literal

"Sadly moved away somewhat from the detective work to make political statements. One of the better detective shows ever on television. The show is about a group of detectives who work in the Special Victims Unit and investigate sex related crimes. The SVU detectives are all dedicated and have their own stories and inner battles. Running for over 20 years is testament to the shows strength. It was far better during the first 10 - 12 years, as would be expected. The show has lost some steam, its edginess and changed direction somewhat over last several seasons. For the first 10 - 12 years of this show it was generally well balanced in its views. It focused closely on the detectives work and catching the criminal. For years now the detective work usually plays second fiddle to the show being self-righteous and making a political statement. But it is still worth watching now if you like detectives shows, just try to watch some episodes from the first 10 - 12 years.

The stories are usually well constructed and interesting. The theme most times is - a crime is committed, the detectives investigate and the case goes to court. The viewer gets taken through most steps of the crime, investigation and court case. The actual detective work portrayed is far from flawless, and often not the way real life detectives could or would work a case. There are often twists and turns in the story, some you see coming some you don't. The production, sets and acting is very good.

The best years of this show are the ones with the well balanced team of Christopher Meloni as Detective Elliot Stabler and Mariska Hargitay as Detective Olivia Benson. Stabler who is a force to be reckoned with but a bit of a loose cannon at times. With Benson as the deep thinker and more compassionate one. They were the stars of the show and a good team. They upheld the law and investigated the cases in a gritty and tough environment. There has always been a strong support cast and often a good guest star. The show has a cast members leaving and being replaced, which keeps the team dynamics fresh and interesting. With the absence of Detective Elliot Stabler during the latter years, the character of Detective Olivia Benson on-screen presence has grown noticeably. Its a shame as some of the other characters are well played and quite interesting, they should get more camera time without Olivia Bensons constant presence. Once a leading detective now Olivia Benson is the Captain of the unit, she is unlike the old captain who gave a few orders and some age old wisdom. Olivia Benson is very hands on and usually takes centre stage in virtually all of the stories with her brand of police work and leftist views on life. Mariska Hargitay became an executive producer of the show, which might explain the growth of the Olivia Benson character. The show has become more and more woke/left which affects the balance of the story telling. During the last several years of the show, its not too hard to guess who committed the crime, as more times than not, it is a nasty white guy, middle to upper class, 25 - 55 years old who is the perpetrator.",literal

"The Shield meets Prison Break Mayor of Kingstown season 1 is a masterpiece. It's like you get inside the soul of The Wire and The Shield, and mix with best of Prison Break. The result is an amazing solid uncommon and risky piece of art.

"Massively overrated. I know I'm a few decades late to the party that is The Sopranos. In between new seasons of shows I found myself finally trying this out because I've never watched it before and it was always raved as one of the greatest series in history of television.

That might have been the case back when it aired but by today's standards it's pretty hard to get through honestly.

The acting is pretty solid, the premise also has a good standing but the way the story unfolds is so everywhere. I can respect it as a pioneer series paving the way for the standards we have in today's industry but it's a hard watch these days. I told myself get through the first season and see if it gets better and it never quite hits that pinnacle it had the potential too.

Good show but massively over rated. I wouldn't even put it in top 10 let alone top 5 shows ever. I barely even finished it. Had to force myself. It's not awful it just doesn't do enough to get you to ever crave more or be emotionally invested. It's just background noise a lot of the time.",literal
"Acting and Cast I feel bad for the seriously talented actors that were roped into accepting their roles. KK is not an actress/actor or anything in between. She is flat in her delivery, limited by her acting skills and addicted to attention.

Acting depends on one's facial expressions and it's not easy to discern much due to her inability to emote visually, removing appeal largely. The script is also bad.",literal

""Freakier Friday"" is a successful legacy sequel, returning to the characters now that Lindsey Lohan is old enough to be the mother of a rebellious teenage daughter, while introducing new aspects as Jamie Lee Curtis's character takes on grandmotherhood, and together they try to understand Gen-Z.

The returning cast and new members all play their roles perfectly, contributing to a retro-feeling family comedy that is needed in theaters. Also, accents are apparently tied to people's bodies and not their minds?",literal
"A Series That Could Have Been Better If The Crew Had Put In Some Extra Effort This is an alright series for all viewers to watch. It could have been a bit better if the crew had pushed themselves to the limit. The storyline of the series was sort of straightforward. It did not have any complete originality. The cast selection was alright. It seemed like they were not fully committed to the storyline. This series reveals to viewers the true nature and reality of growing up and building a life. In the world of today, everything is unpredictable and no one really knows what is out there in the world of today. I have never been allowed to build a life for myself. I have been restricted by everyone who is in my life. This is an alright series that could have been a whole lot better.",literal
"Easily one of the best shows on Television today, Suspenseful, Humorous and Riveting-Can't Miss TV! Easily one of the best shows on television today, suspenseful, humorous and real-not always pleasant or formulaic-but real! Just when I think Bellesario has gone too far in the ""lets screw up Jag"" sweepstakes (ok-2 episodes this year were actually good-the rest-terrible!)-he redeems himself with a show that is riveting, timely and funny at the right times!

The casting, the writing, the overall look of the show is first class! Starting at the top with Mark Harmon, the sexiest man on TV-he also sets the tone with his right on portrayal of the most conflicted man on TV today! His obsession with Ari (the terrorist), his list of rules, then his tendency to think out of the box just adds to the spice and pace of this show. (Plus his constant dueling with DiNozzo-priceless!)

An added plus is the inter meshing of the cast-David McCallum-funny, urbane- so hot! His stories are hysterical, then his sad commentary on the life or death of their latest subject-just gives you pause. His diatribe on the terrorist and what he did to his assistant alone is Emmy award stuff-don't mess with Ducky ever again! Then we have the reason for Rule 12-Special Agent Catlin Todd-the writers don't always have a clue as to her portrayal but she always pulls it off (and that humor of hers-the end lines alone are great!) I have to disagree as to the chemistry with Gibbs/Kate-it's there all right-hopefully we get to see something come of it in Season 2! The actors portraying Abby and DiNozzo-Pauly Perrette and Michael Weatherly are hysterical, yet right on in their portrayals-especially when DiNozzo thinks with his hormones and not with his brain-then turns around and saves the day-this show is a keeper! I can hardly wait for season 2!",literal

"Season 6 just ended I stumbled on Chicago Fire when season 4 was about to be aired, so I had 3 seasons to catch up with, and oh boy. As the majority say, the pilot isn't anything to brag about but give it 80 minutes more and you shouldn't be able to stop watch it. I would say that season 6 is the weakest one, but it is not bad at all. It holds quality and entertain the viewer. 

The character development is flawless, and after 6 seasons you feel a real connection with the characters (even those who have arrived midway thru). The cliffhangers, plottwists, crossovers and each unique episode is absolutely flawless and it will keep you stuck with it, but you'll have to get over the treshold (which is the pilot and the second episode).",literal
"Empty and Overhyped This show just isn't good. The basic idea of virus attack or body snatching is been used so many times before.

Characters behave in silly and unrealistic ways. Scientist taking off her protective glove to touch a dead lab rat is the kind of mistake you'd see in a comedy, not a serious show.

Main character which I thoughjt is a ""Karen"" is loud, stubborn and thinks she's always right.

Her personal drama and representation feels forced and unnecessary, like the show is begging for attention.

The dialogue is weak and tries to sound deep, but it ends up feeling shallow. Show is more focused on pushing certain messages than on telling a good story.

The acting doesn't help either. The main actress overacts in every scene-always angry, always yelling, never showing real emotion or grief. Everyone else feels flat and unimportant trying to overdo their foreign indian or whatever accent.

After the big event happened and people turn into mindless drones, the story barely moves forward.

People wander around while nothing meaningful gets explained. Oh Yes, of course, it is told slow to raise the tension. Yawn.

Only greenlit because it has a famous name attached.

On top of that, it looks like review sites were hit with a wave of overly positive, fake-sounding reviews to boost the score and readsing like ads.

Overall, the show is weak, unoriginal, and nowhere near as good as its hype.",literal
"Can we pleaseeee get a second movie? It was amazing! Every song, every scene and every design! With an amazing plot with with the tease of romance and slight mystery it was perfect. But we need or atleast in my opinion we need a second movie where somehow Jinu and Rumi somehow get together I don't care how I just need it (and a second movie mainly so we get more amazing music) I've had to rewatch it 5 times already and having the tiger and bird added in is just adorable. Overall it's most definitely the best Netflix films I've ever seen and Zoey and Mira were so perfect maybe if we get a second movie (really pushing for one) the other saja boys will somehow be reformed since the girls have their souls maybe they're being kept in another world kind of like how the demons are separated from the humans?

"IMMACULATE AND REFRESHING My favourite animated movie in a long time. Very refreshing and original idea. It was much deeper and meaningful than I thought it would be - I originally just anticipated to watch a surface level kids show but this is not that. I love the characters and the plot. The songs were so good too!! Let's not forget the amazing lyrics. The humour too! The only flaw is that there's no part 2 😭

If you're looking for a light hearted but meaningful movie with bangers to jam to, then this is the movie. All the songs are in my Spotify now haha.

I also would love to chat more about the underlying and subtle meanings about the kpop industry in general. I think this show is like a metaphor for what's currently going on there. Really great.",literal

If you're not a GIRL who wants to have FUN, then this is probably not your movie I fear. It's not 'good'. But that's not why I decided to go see ANOTHER COLLEEN HOOVER ADAPTATION. I'm here for a good time. And that's what I got.",literal
"Is the FBI this unprofessional? Does the FBI follow this protocol?

1. If in doubt intimidate people.

2. If you plan to question someone always and I mean ALWAYS give them a chance to run, I mean if they are standing next to a motorbike be sure to yell at them from across the street that you are FBI and that you want to talk. Gotta get in that cardio and best to get paid for doing it.

3. Don't bring in the right person at first, be sure to arrest someone who obviously has nothing to do with the case so you can handcuff them to a table and then make derogatory remarks about their life choices. Then be sure to let them know how superior you are before you let them go.

4. Pretty much do whatever you want, no one ever sues even if you start shooting in a public place and hit innocent people.

5. If people don't recognize your superiority immediately, draw your gun and point it straight at them.

6. Be sure to threaten people who don't answer questions by saying, ""lying to the FBI is a felony.""

I doubt this has anything to do with how the FBI actually operates. It's an ok show if you like contrived plots and repetitive behaviours. There is a fleeing suspect EVERY SINGLE EPISODE and the chase could easily be avoided EVERY SINGLE EPISODE.",literal
Twists and turns Absolutely loved this. So many twists and turns. Character development was excellent. Story telling was excellent. Some loose ends that i wish had gone differently but nothing to loose sleep over. Sarah Snook was spectacular. This was a beautiful piece of work. Did not intend on binge watching but couldnt wait to see what happened after each episode. The end was satisfying . Great job by the team.,literal
A beautiful adaptation The show did a fan service to the beloved gaming franchise of the fallout series. The show was amazing to watch and had even small details to the game shown really good. The creat build up was amazing giving each unique character was given there own story to be told on 3 different occasions. The show did justice to side quest sections of show and really showed up to the expectations of game itself. The brother hood steel was great to see and different vaults in show was s huge preference to game itself. The has good humour and dark humour to it. It was one best game adulteration show of 2024 in April.,literal
"A healing movie for Jonas fans and a cosy Christmas comedy for everyone else. If you follow the Jonas Brothers, you already know their personalities, or at least the parts they choose to share with us. This movie leans into that in the best way, and honestly, it feels like it heals the old scars left from their breakup. There's something really comforting about seeing them together, laughing, leaning into the chaos and the warmth that made people fall for them in the first place.

This isn't a movie that's going to win an Oscar, but it's not meant to. It serves its purpose. It's a love letter to the fans and a genuinely fun Christmas movie you can watch with the family. It doesn't pretend to be anything bigger and that's exactly why it works.

The cast is stacked too. KJ Apa and Billie Lourd absolutely steal the show every time they're on screen. The whole thing has more heart than you'd expect, and it never takes itself too seriously.

This has been the year of a Jonas and I'm completely here for it. As a Jonas fan, it's an easy 10/10. For everyone else, call it a solid 6/10 on the Christmas movie scale. Light, funny, sweet and exactly what it needed to be.",figurative

"Less personal relationships and more action I have been a fan of Chicago Fire since day one. When it first started, I watched it for the fire and rescue related calls, the action. I find now, it is far less about calls or incidents to which a fire department would respond, and far more about personal relationships and political nonsense. I can get that junk on other shows. Last night I watched what I consider the best episode of Chicago Med produced to date, because it focused on the events of a hospital emergency department the entire episode, not personal relationships.",literal
"Excess Baggage I was utterly enraptured by the first series - because it so encapsulated what a holiday is - wildly anxious and full of doubt and tension. A brilliantly rich character piece, fantastically woven with stunning performances all round - but Coolidge's troubled McQuoid and Daddario's conflicted journalist stood out for me particularly. There's buckets of layered commentary on contemporary culture, wealth and privilege - although not every part felt vital, and a few decisions, (however well intentioned) made the production itself sometimes trip into the culture in which it is satirising. However when White Lotus hits its stride the tension is unbearable - counterpointed with beautiful music and cinematography. At the core of it though - are the brilliantly observed characters - who all went to make it one summer holiday I'll never forget.

((In fact, we're none of us allowed to forget it as it got a second series, sharper, tighter and even more tense. The series is getting rightfully lavished with praise from all sides now which is very gratifying))

-- Third Season addendum --

The least consistent series of the three and the first crack in the White Lotus armour, but even then, it easily has the strongest performances of the entire franchise (the brilliant Sam Rockwell, the superstar Aimee Lou Wood and so on) and continues the high barr for tension, twists and intercharacter drama. The theme of death and faith and life is fascinatingly explored here, but again there's no denying there was a slight tonal overreach and the moments throughout feel underplayed or overstated by different measures.",literal
"Slick all-star nonsense is still nonsense Now You See Me starts out really well. A group of illusionists are brought together and within a year they are playing Vegas together and appear to rob a bank in Paris remotely. This draws in the FBI and Interpol but how can they prove anything when it all seems so impossible and so hard to prove? This setup offers a twisty and engaging plot but sadly it is one that never gets delivered upon. Instead what we get is a constantly moving film that is loaded with stars, money and special effects but nothing of nay real substance.

This approach works really well when it comes to the slickness of delivery and how polished it all feels, but it is so very unsatisfying as a whole product. The twists and turns of the film are almost all nonsense – slickly elaborate and delivered with pace for sure, but with nothing behind of any substance. As a result I stopped caring about the plot or about working out what was going on behind the theatrics. Movement appeared to be the all and after a while I tired of it. The slick delivery is all well and good and it is added to by the cast – so many faces, so many quality actors all getting handsomely paid but doing very little. It felt like a waste.

It isn't a terrible film by any means; the pace and slickness makes it work on that level but it does very little else which is engaging or memorable. It is fluff that fills the time but leaves you with nothing after that.",figurative
"Decent Introductory Episode I'm not quite understanding the extremely negative reviews I'm seeing here. This is the first episode and it's really introducing the cast, what they do, and how we got here. I love Morris Chestnut and Randall Parks, so am excited about seeing them in a new series.

This is kind of reminiscent of Morris' old series Rosewood which was cancelled way too soon for me, so am hoping this one lasts a while. I've seen people saying this is a new version of House. They both deal with medical mysteries, but they have their own vibes.

I have high hopes for where this series is going, especially with the introduction of Moriarity, and can we hope for Jonny Lee Miller as Sherlock?",literal
"Will Bailey be there Forever? I really enjoy this series and truly like the way the cast has always felt very cohesive and they just ""work""!

Unfortunately, I have to say when Nolan's newest love interest, Bailey the Firefighter joined the cast, it was like What the Hell! Just threw the entire camaraderie feeling totally off! She just doesn't fit and spoiled the happy feelings?

She not a very good actress, looks aren't everything! It surprises me they would disrupt a good thing? Not sure why, but she's still there. There has to be an answer to explain this subpar choice! I truly hope they come to their senses and send her off to some midday soap or something more suited for her lack of acting chops!",literal
"One of the best action films I've seen This was an insane trip from beginning to the end. It blew the first one outta the water on every front. The action, way better. The villain, way more menacing. This movie actually was emotional and made me feel things, especially the end. Effects we're also great. While the story is what it is like with Sisu 1, I think this just has more. Simple but done well.

This is easily the best action flick Finland has made but I think it might be my favorite ever. The action is that good, with some of the most creative kills I've seen.",literal
"So far, so good So far, I'm enjoying this show. I consider it a more serious ""Scrubs"".

To be honest, I started watching it because of the beautiful vistas of Seattle that they show at the beginning of the first episode. I love this city and most of the city views they showed so far would be very hard (or impossible) for me to get otherwise. Seattle is breathtaking on a sunny day.

But this was just what caught my attention initially. I fell in love with the cast and up to this point I enjoyed every minute of ""Grey's Anatomy"". Some people think it's not realistic and I agree with them, but what TV show is? And if it WAS realistic, I don't think I would watch it. Have you ever been to a hospital? Was it interesting? I didn't think so. 

I hope the show stays interesting and funny and if you're looking for reality, don't watch TV.",figurative
"The Running Man (2025) - A Sprint Straight Into Mediocrity You know, I once went on a lad's holiday in Barcelona. On paper, it sounded amazing. Beautiful city, total freedom, stacks of spending money, activities lined up like dominos. In reality? A disaster. One mate lost his passport within an hour, another fractured two ribs trying to reenact Mario Kart in real life, and a third vanished for half a day after going A-WOL on night one. And that wasn't even the worst of it. One guy got a little too friendly with the Bolivian marching powder and decided to fist-fight his bathroom mirror at 4 AM, nearly getting us all arrested.

Sometimes the things that should be great turn out to be catastrophes. And that, dear viewer, brings me seamlessly to The Running Man (2025).

This remake was supposed to be a slam dunk. A faithful adaptation of the Stephen King novel. Written and directed by Edgar Wright, the man behind Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead. Starring Glenn Powell, a charismatic rising star. With all that going for it, what could possibly go wrong?

Everything. Absolutely everything.

This movie is a calamity-slow, dull, convoluted, and tonally confused. The pacing has all the urgency of a Chris Stuckmann review about a film he clearly didn't want to talk about. The story meanders until it abruptly sprints to a rushed, anticlimactic ending. The dialogue is dire. The emotional tone ping-pongs between ""gritty thriller"" and ""awkward comedy."" And our protagonist? He has the depth and charisma of a puddle of congealed vomit.

This remake somehow manages to be inferior to the 1987 Schwarzenegger film in every conceivable way. I can't believe the man who directed Hot Fuzz made this.

But I watched it so you don't have to. The least you can do is let me explain why you should avoid it like a weekend in Barcelona with a coke-fuelled lunatic.

The Plot (Such As It Is)

Like the original, the story is set in a dystopian future America ruled by corporations who keep the public docile with violent reality TV. The biggest show is The Running Man. In the 1987 movie, this meant something simple: survive a gauntlet of killers in a restricted zone. Easy to follow, urgent, fun.

But this remake? No chance.

Now, runners must survive for 30 days across the entire country. They get a bit of money and a 12-hour head start. And anyone-literally anyone-can either kill them or turn them in for cash. They also have to send in a daily video tape via a magical Dropbox system.

Enter Ben Richards, a struggling worker who needs money for his sick daughter. So he joins the game. His cover gets blown immediately, a kill team attacks, they all die in a gas explosion, and the network deepfakes his tape to frame him for murder. Over time Richards realizes the game is unwinnable and everything is rigged by Dan Killian, the network director, who manipulates the show for maximum ratings.

Richards turns from prey to predator, joining an underground resistance group and taking the fight back to Killian.

Sounds thrilling? It isn't.

Why It Doesn't Work

All the ingredients should make for a gripping thriller: A desperate father pushed to extremes A corrupt system rigged against him A nation hunting him down A ticking clock A rebellion rising in the shadows

But it's been done before-better-in 1987. That film had a tight runtime, a clear message about sensationalism and corporate greed, a fun roster of colorful villains, and a satisfying ending.

This remake does none of that.

It's bloated by 30 extra minutes yet accomplishes less. The pacing is horrendous. There's no urgency. The 30-day rule is pointless because the story doesn't use the time. It could've been a 24-hour chase and been infinitely better.

The script leans heavily on coincidences whenever it writes itself into a corner. Three separate times Richards is randomly rescued by a conveniently placed resistance member. It's lazy writing dressed up as plot progression.

The Edgar Wright Problem

This is the most baffling part. Edgar Wright used to be a master of punchy, efficient writing and razor-sharp dialogue. His films crackle with energy. But this? This feels like someone imitating Edgar Wright after reading his Wikipedia page.

There's: No clever editing No snappy dialogue No memorable characters No style No wit

Scenes drag on endlessly. Characters recite exposition we already know. Richards repeats his motivations so often I thought the film was glitching.

The Characters (or Lack Thereof)

Glenn Powell is a likeable actor, but this script gives him absolutely nothing. Richards is written as both a sympathetic family man and a violent anti-establishment rebel, but the movie can't decide which version it actually wants. So it awkwardly does both, poorly.

The hunters-from the original film's iconic rogues' gallery-are replaced with bland soldiers who look like they came from a discount military surplus sale.

Even Amber, the original's female lead, becomes an afterthought here. She doesn't show up until late in the film, does nothing, then literally gets ejected from the plot.

It's embarrassing.

The Final Verdict

Everything the 1987 film got right-tone, pacing, structure, characters, payoff-this remake gets wrong. Spectacularly wrong. It's a joyless, meandering, unfocused slog that wastes its cast, its director, and its budget.

The only thing that runs in The Running Man is the audience-straight out of the theater.

Save your money, save your time, save your sanity. Go watch something more enjoyable, like an exorcism.",figurative
"Boring. I can't find anything likable about any of the characters. They're all spoiled rich jerks. The story is a long drawn-out ""plot"". You want to care about the lost kid, but the story doesn't work. Everyone is fake and there's annoying orchestral Hollywood music in the background. Struggled to find anything redeeming through 3 episodes in between naps. Sarah Snook was great in Succession, but she's wasted here. Couldn't take any more. This was a total waste of time.",figurative
"Very good, but kind of rushed Dont get me wrong, I really do like this show a lot. But I wish it wasn't so rushed. It just seems like everything is going on at once and its a bit hard to keep up with. And not to mention there is a song every second. Like seriously. They burst into a song literally in the middle of everything and its kinda annoying and very hard to watch and it gets boring. But beside all of that, the show is really good. I also do wish the swearing and the sexual jokes wasnt so out of hand if your really trying to get your audience to enjoy the show. The writing is alright as well. But there are much funny moments and the characters arent boring and they have personality that they express a lot which is what I love to see. If your not a fan of musicals, I wouldn't recommend this show. (theres atleast 2-4 songs per episode.) and some of them are for no reason. But if you dont mind, then I suggest giving this show a try and have your own opinion on the show!",literal
"No ending Well executed despite the replay of the same events from three differing perspectives. It does draw the viewer in...and then just abandons them, as if the scriptwriter just got bored and went home, leaving viewers frustrated and annoyed.

A polished start and middle of a story - but no ending! Avoid!",figurative
"what we know and don't know can lead to perceptive contrasts Since its debut last year, Netflix's ""Stranger Things"" has become a popular show. I just binge-watched the first season. A couple of things struck me. One is of course the focus on government secrets and how Will's disappearance leads to the realization that this small, idealistic town might not be what it seems. Equally significant is the look at and allusions to 1980s popular culture.* But beyond that, there's the contrast between Will's family and Mike's family. Mike comes from an affluent family in an immaculate house, while Will comes from a working-class family in a house not in the best condition. These set the stage for the eerie events soon to dominate the town.

From the first episode, it was clear that this was going to be a good show, and it didn't disappoint. Winona Ryder, as Will's distraught mother, puts on what has to be the best performance of her career. If you only know her from her ""cute"" roles, then you're in for a pleasant surprise. Outstanding series.

And remember, the bad men are coming.

*I understand that the show's creators tracked down the makers of the era's board games to find out what they got called in foreign languages, so as to be able to properly localize the show in foreign countries.",literal
"Hey! Eyes up here! The Superman we needed! With the new DC franchise, James Gunn starts it with his take on the Man of Steel himself. This film is not just for current fans or fans from the start, it also speaks to everyone. This is the Superman film that we might not have asked but it is definitely what we needed. This does not just focus on the superhero genre. It's a roller-coaster action packed yet it has the emotion and heart of a superhero story. It does not just showed Superman that he is invincible. It also showed his weaknesses, yet he still shows that he is a man of hope.

The film also did not waste other characters. Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen, the Justice Gang played important parts. Hoult's performance was Lex Luthor was insane! The Fortress of Solitude was also not sidelined. And there's Krypto! Man Krypto definitely stole the show! Brosnahan's Lois Lane was really well executed and Corenswet as Clark Kent / Superman was really amazing!

The film also had its surprises but overall, it is very well made. James Gunn, you outdid yourself again this time! Thank you for bringing this to life. Probably the best film this year so far! A definite worth the watch!",literal
"Canadiana Lost in Americanised Screenplay This story is based on wonderfully written mysteries by Canadian author L. R. Wright.

His title was Staff Sergeant for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. He dated the small town Sechelt librarian Cassandra Mitchell. Author Wright who was known as Bunny was born in Saskatchewan and lived in Abbotsford, BC. Her books were full of gentle authentic Canadianisms.

"Series 2 fell off a cliff I loved the first series of this, it was genuinely funny, compelling and well-written. I binged the hell out of it.

So what happened to series 2?? It was all over the place. Having established Sly by the end of S1 they needed to throw new adversaries at him but they went mad, throwing three different groups into the mix and then deciding late on which of them was the real bad guy.

It wasted too much time on his family relationships and while you do need your characters to be grounded to generate empathy for them, there was too much of this and it really slowed the episodes down.

I agree with the reviewers who say the whole concept is ridiculous - that he just waltzes in, punches someone and everyone accepts him taking over, that the police barely feature during all this crime, that the portrayal of NY seems silly. But I don;t mind all that - it's entertainment and it's not trying to be a Scorsese movie. But the story was a mess and that hurt series 2 badly.

We have all known for ages that Taylor Sheridan has been spreading himself far too thinly - the Yellowstone prequels were boring and the final series of that is looking pretty shaky for being forced not to include Costner.

Maybe this was just a great one-series show but like so many, they make more of it without having anything else to say. If it does get a S3 I really hope they don't mess that up too.",literal
"The Newgrounds Animators Have Finally Made It Following the production of the ""Hellbenders"" pilot and the brief history of Sleepy Cabin, its great to finally see some of the best internet funny bois get their vision on TV. It fully retains the spontaneity of Zach and Michael's unique internet animation styles and wastes no time at all with the jokes. The structure of the 12-min short is split into 2 plots which are equally fascinating and bizarre but not in the way a lot of ""edgy"" or subversive adult animated shows tend to be. The looseness of the drawing style helps the craziness never seem like its on rails, it truly feels like you're in the mind of 2 nutbag internet artists and I love it.

Mike Stoklasa's performance will be one for the history books.",figurative
"This is really, really good. First off, I don't think it's a spoiler to say that I can smell Gary Oldman's stink through the screen. So much so that I even googled how much time he spends in make-up to achieve how downright nasty his character appears on the screen. But alas!!! I found nothing. But trust me, if he was ""Character Acting"" we would know. The co-stars would say something. Claire Danes played a similarly disgusting person on Homeland, but Gary is far, far more obvious in his portrayal. That said, this is basically a story of a bunch of Millennials and Boomers forced together in a spy vs. Spy sort of story. There is a lot of humor (American English= American spelling) a little bit of violence and a whole lot of sticking it to the man and behind the back betrayal. But on the whole, it's about two very distinct (I can only come up with personalities) ways of saving the people within the country's borders of Great Britain from terrorism. One side being the all great MI5 and the other being their miscreant, screwup, castoffs. This show is fun. I think that this is only the third show/movie since I joined IMDB more than 20 years ago that I rated above an 8. However, I still can't rate MASH or Cheers. I don't know why, because I am a Boomer after all, let's just say that my rating this a 9 is high praise indeed.",literal
"This way better than I expected I'll watch absolutely anything Michael Shannon is in. Absolutely very underrated actor and probably one of the best of this generation.

"Materialists, Pretty but Shallow I walked into Materialists hoping for something sharp, unsettling, and soul rattling, something in the vein of Past Lives, a film that crawled under my skin and refused to leave. What I got was... just fine. Stylish, clever, occasionally moving but shallow compared to what it could have been. Materialists isn't bad, Dakota Johnson owns every frame with a presence that makes everything else fade. The visuals shine, and both Pascal and Evans are fine.

But for me, it never went deep enough. It toyed with love vs money, dating & marriage but only skimmed the surface. Anyways It's smart, it's pretty, and it has moments of brilliance. But for someone who craves films that leaves impact, Materialists felt like a missed opportunity. I wanted more, More emotion, more depth.",figurative
"Three for laughs Saw first episode. The most (non intentional) funny opening disaster scene in filmdom.

However, if you want a Mystery Science Theater kind of fun with a friend....watch it.",literal
"The new season 2022 Has been badly managed I've watched all of the new episodes this year and I am very disappointed in their selection of actors, Kevin Bernard and Sam Waterston excepted.

Jeff Donovan comes off as an Angry undisciplined cop who just isn't likeable. We've done that with Elliot Stabler and it has run its course. We don't need Jeremhy Sisto but we need someone who we can cheer for and Donovan's portrayal isn't it.

I know it is all the rave to complain about the unequal treatment by police officers but I watched the last two episodes yesterday and Detective Bernard complained about it in both episodes almost the same way. Move on from that, get back to good stories and let the audience draw their own conclusions about disequity. We're not stupid and we certainly don't need to be beat over the head with it.

As for Hugh Dancy - Wow, what a nothing of an ADA. No passion, no empathy for the victims, just an automoton.

Finally, the story writing is lazy with huge plot holes so they can stitch up the story quick and get in more commercials. The writers should be fired and get a new crew.

I loved all the old episodes of Law and Order and was so excited about the restart - and then the producers went about making sure it would fail.",literal
"The show that changed TV forever There have been a lot of great TV since its conception. The fact remained though that it was overall beneath movies in quality.

Enter the first of many similar HBO masterpieces. This show presents itself as the story about a family man tackling the every-day problems of life, only one difference: he is in the mafia. This show dared to go where no TV and not many movies had gone before. It actually portrayed the players in the criminal life as complex human beings and made them relatable.

The Godfather and Scroreses works are all fantastic, but Sopranos truly broke new ground in not romantisicing the inner playings of the mafia in any way.

The actors are all fantastic, especially the late James Gandolfini, and do a great job of conveying this unique and never-before seen story.

Whilst being great in its own right, it paved the way for pretty much all great TV shows since and HBO shows such as Game of Thrones, The Wire, Treme, Rome, The Outsider and so on.

It is definitely a recommendation any day of the week if you haven't (for unlikely reasons) watched it yet!",literal
"Boring - Unrealistic Ted Danson and the makers of ""The Good Place"" enticed me to this show. Episode after episode , was hoping something interesting to happen but just cliche after cliche. The whole premise is of a retirement community where some stuff has got stolen and Ted Danson goes in to investigate as an insider.

The community is picture perfect to ridiculous levels where every employee is a passionate and perfect employee. The retirement centre feels like a five star resort. How on earth can these old people afford it and how can you sympathise with any of them , considering the struggles actual old people face in reality with poor finances,health and basic care.

Even the guy who has cancer is never shown even in pain once and looks hale and hearty. If this was what you faced as an old person, you will retire and move in there right away.

Unbelievable that this is the same group which made a masterpiece like ""The Good Place"".",figurative
"Too much misery, not enough comedy I'll start by saying Rose Byrne did an excellent job of acting in this movie. That said, the non-stop misery dumped on the audience made this movie borderline unwatchable. There really needed to be more lighthearted, comedic, or endearing moments in this film. Instead, the onslaught of dysfunction and poor choices ran wild like a tidal wave of anguish and sorrow. If I wanted to spend two hours watching a glut of calamity and misfortune, I would have turned on the news.",literal
"Trolley Problem in overdrive! Great film without excessive deployment of sfx or gung ho 'hero/ine'.

Central issue of pre-emptive/ retaliatory strike or 'wait and see' outcome was pertinent to our times and laid out clearly.

Easy to google this philosophy classic!

Anyway , hugely engaging film and would see again in order to discuss!",literal
"Go and watch the 1994 masterpiece instead Even if the film is visually beautiful, it feels like a superficial version of the 1994 movie. If by chance you haven't seen Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (1994), go watch it instead and you'll see what I'm talking about. I can't believe so many people are writing euphoric reviews.

Every strong punchline from the 1994 film is reduced to a mere shadow here. Every opportunity to convey the creature's sorrow is missed. Instead of expressing it cinematically, del Toro chose to deliver it through direct narration from Frankenstein's monster, which I found rather dull.

Additionally, the makeup of Frankenstein's monster feels more aesthetic than eerie or realistic, which was a letdown for me.",figurative
"Utterly hilarious trash In a Spinal Tap moment Sirk said ""This is the dialectic - there is a very short distance between high art and trash, and trash that contains an element of craziness is by this very quality nearer to art."" Well its almost Hegel, its so incomprehensible.

This movie deserves a 1 or a 10, anything in the middle in not fair. It's either the worst sickly idiotic spiritualist romantic schlock; or genuine art. No. the latter is too ridiculous an indefensible with this nonsense which causes dangerous convulsions with its clichés.

Sirk deserved better and he was a true intellectual, but its impossible to defend this banal drivel.

And why are the male characters in these movies - and Sirk's in particular - such neutered boards of 4X2 who whisper in low comforting tones?",literal
"A good actioner Having just finished reading Stephen King's 'The Running Man', and having just seen this movie, I say that while the former astounded me, the latter served purposes of mere entertainment.  The novel 'The Running Man', written in '82 is 100 times more potent in it's horrifying Orwellian vision of our future.  With the mind-numbing, scapegoating shows on Reality TV, it is very easy to see that in the 2025 this sort of organized madness is plausible. 'The Running Man' movie has lost almost all the social commentary of its source material, but manages to retain the sense of raw suspense the book carried throughout.  As a film, this is no Terminator 2, or even a Total Recall, but its still a decent actioner, certainly better than the tripe Schwarzenegger turns out today (Although I have fingers crossed for T3)",literal
"Honestly... This was AMAZING! I watched it out of curiosity more than anything and I ended up loving it! It is such a refreshing theme and concept. A bit like modern day girl power. Also reminded me at times of the powerpuff girls!

I don't really know or follow anything about KPop but this seems rammed full with K-pop culture references. Almost like a beginners guide.

The music is classic K-Pop though.

I just loved it. Probably not the most helpful review. But I really enjoyed so many aspects. The storyline, character development, relationship dynamics, the music, the production design... all of it!

I loved each individual female character as well.

Will definitely watch it again!",literal
"Leans More Towards History Lesson Than Drama, But Still Solid There are two ways to make a historical film such as Nuremberg. The first is to take some liberties (if more in time than in actual facts/events) in pursuit of drama. The second is the ""just the facts, ma'am"" strategy. Director/writer James Vanderbilt takes the latter approach here, which crimps the movie's ceiling but also raises its floor.

For a very basic overview, this film looks at the Nuremberg Trials largely from the perspective of Douglas Kelley (Rami Malek), a psychiatrist brought in to evaluate the German prisoners, most notably Hermann Goring (Russell Crowe). Simultaneously, Justice Robert H. Jackson (Michael Shannon) struggles to put together a war crimes trial unlike anything any justice system has ever seen.

I'll start with the ceiling-limitation on Nuremberg, which is that it's far from Spielberg-ian drama. This is a simply-made film that does not lean into dramatic flourishes. This approach renders it more ""history lesson"" than ""fully engrossing drama"". As such, it's tough to give Nuremberg the highest of marks.

On the positive side of things, Nuremberg covers a compelling story which was truly a watershed moment in the history of war and its crimes. Crowe is chilling in embodying the pompous Goring, while Malek portrays a wonderfully sympathetic adversary. The final 20-30 minutes are the highlight here, when the psychological battling and the actual trial converge.

All told, Nuremberg is a movie that deftly portrays all the themes it sets out to cover. The underlying message, that fascism isn't contained to the Nazi regime, is an important one (if frustratingly difficult to convey with high drama and still be as historically accurate as Vanderbilt shoots for here). This results in somewhat of a ""take your medicine and learn your history"" feel to the overall experience (eschewing manufactured drama), but the end result is still a solid flick from which at least some entertainment and many lessons can be derived.",literal
"Not as Quite in love with this show as majority of people out there ))) Personally, I find that the main character is much less interesting than some other heroes of this series...For example : I would definitely prefer more storytelling about Mike and Nacho , for me , they have much more interesting storylines than Saul himself ... Also , some of the situations are stretched for a very long time , to the point of really getting on my nerves ( the story with Chuck...), i mean , he got on my nerves , so badly , that almost immediately after couple of appearances , I've already wished him dead)))Anyhow , not the worst one time watch ...",literal
"A good copy of an excellent original The French original is one of my favourites. Unfortunately, the French DVDs (no Blu-Ray! ) do not have subtitles. This English language copy is an exact copy of the French version. The French casting of the lead actress is (much) better though, which may explain my rating of #7. Unfortunately, Dutch broadcasting stopped after season 1 but I've never forgotten this excellent French series.....",literal
"This was dissapointing This was really disappointing, i had hoped for a proper horror, but bland characters, not a cohesive story telling.

It feels a bit random at times, the cgi is okish but its definitely not made to scare you with ambiance, but loud audio and quick moving pics or flashy pics, the cheap way of doing horror, and definitely trying to copy stranger things to a degree but falls flat on it's face in that attempt. Even the neon lighting doesn't hit as it should and don't even give a ambiance mood setting, where is the character building or Derry lore?

The story feels to simplified as of yet and i found it rather boring.",figurative
"Originally a great show Spare yourself the agony of watching the new (21st) season. The franchise is a classic, that cannot be overstated. However, the writing and acting in the newest season are terrible. Anthony Anderson is a funny comedian. A serious drama actor, he is not. His co-stars aren't great either. It is a shame what some of these franchises have become in recent years. Write new shows if you want them to flop, don't take down exceptional series like this one.",literal
"Phenomenally done and I can't wait for more This is so cleverly written! The acting is also great, though Gomez is the weak link in the chain.

The story is very well written, the dialogue is believable. The cast is great despite Gomez' weak pedigree. But everything else was absolutely worth seeing again and again. Very, very funny and smart. The mystery is very compelling and engaging. I love it.

Highly recommend.",literal
Drawn out This could have been a good series if they collapsed into 5-6 episodes. It is so drawn out that I found myself fast forwarding through superlative dialogue and scenes. Acting is passable at best with very mediocre performances. The lead investigator with the BPD and Nick from the FBI are annoying with wooden performances.,literal
"Not at all the type of film I usually watch...but I did enjoy it and am glad I saw it. Of all the different genres of films, I think modern horror is probably my least favorite. I love old horror films...mostly because they aren't extremely graphic and leave a lot to the imagination. But this is a case which proves I can be won over by a violent modern horror pic. The only reason I saw this one at all is because my daughter wanted to see it...and I didn't wanna disappoint her.

I am not going to make this review long...as there are nearly 800 for this hit film already. Suffice to say, the movie is scary, the story very good (the things omitted from the book are generally best not being in the film) and I enjoyed the heck out of the picture. Who knows...maybe I don't hate the genre...just the brainless teens begin slaughtered at the abandoned amusement park/roller disco by a guy in a hockey mask sort of film.",literal
"Could of been a 10 Very good movie all in all however there was no reason for the DRex to be in the movie what so ever which made it a 7 for me.

The main portion of the movie before it's introduction was very good however I expected the end of the movie to make me leave my seat however the main antagonist just walked away with no big battle like you see in all other chapters of the franchise.

Like other reviews I've read I agree that this was a super cinematic experience and everything was awesome on screen.

There were a few parts of the movie where I feel they added random bits in to make it a reasonable length after a long wait for the movie otherwise really solid until the ending.",literal

"Just ain't funny I will be honest when i watch this all I can think about is Scrubs which was one of my favorite shows. However, this show missed on the trying to blend comedy while covering a serious topic. Maybe it isn't fair but that is the standard. You can also see they are trying to copy the Office which makes sense, but sometimes when they look at the camera it just don't make sense and it absolutely isn't funny. I only made it through the first four episodes but on the last one me and my wife was kind of giving it one last chance but we stopped half way through. We did not even come close to laughing once. It is too bad, we really would like to have a good new comedy but this show is not it.",literal
"Fun, clever and very entertaining. Not much needs to be said, one of the best shows out there currently and should be watched by everyone at least once in their life. The characters are also probably the best in any movie or TV-show, as they are all VERY well acted and each have a unique, fun and interesting personality.",literal
"No aspect excels Everything about this movie is below average. Nothing stands out or makes it all worth it. The story is fine. The characters are inconsequential. The comedy is bad. The action is mediocre at best. I guess the music is pretty good.

I love me a good popcorn flick, but I couldn't get into this at all. I was bored and uninvested. And there are a few highly questionable parts. Especially one involving a character introduced near the end of the movie (or why you're introducing a seemingly important character this late).

"Nope. Frankenstein's monster is not a superhero. He doesn't growl like a bear or a dinosaur. He can't be shot twenty times and keep coming. Further, I don't care about Victor Frankenstein's boyhood. I don't enjoy watching the gilded rich in their massive gowns while listening to future Victor's verbose narration. Give me the story of a man who created another man out of body parts. The horror of that is enough. Give me the perspective of such a creature. The sadness of that is sufficient.

Here instead we have another overcooked grasping for what the algorithms demand, the further dumbing down of cinema for the distracted smartphone generation. Yeah yeah, it's Guillermo Del Toro. I'm familiar. I've had dinner with him. And his last good film was Pan's Labyrinth.

See you on down the road.

"A brilliant performance by Billy Bob Thornton Billy Bob Thornton delivers a standout performance as Tommy Norris, a seasoned landman navigating the treacherous terrain of the oil industry. His portrayal adds depth to the series, anchoring its complex narrative.

The show skillfully intertwines family dynamics with the high-stakes oil business. While some characters, like Jacob Lattland's Cooper Norris and Paulina Chavez's Ariana, may feel slightly contrived, they effectively contribute to the overarching storyline.

Set against the backdrop of Texas's rugged landscape, ""Landman"" offers a raw and authentic portrayal of the oil industry's impact on individuals and communities. Sheridan's direction ensures a compelling viewing experience, making it a must-watch for fans of intense drama.",literal
"Damn When I came into this, I thought I was going to watch a quick little movie from Sony that has gone viral and that me and my friends joke about. And I was fully expecting this film to be made for three groups, Asian-American immigrants who can point to the screen and say ""look mommy, I'm being represented."" The second group being white American girl who move to Japan to learn about ""culture"" but actually just make TikToks on sacred statues and that think this movie is ""kawaii"" even they don't know what it means and their two brain cells can't fathom that the K in K-pop stand for Korea and the third group being overweight autistic anime loving gooners who are just as obsessed with Japanese ""culture"" as the white girl, except they would probably get mad that this is in English and doesn't have English subtitles because English is the only language they know but they can scarily pronounce Japanese words pretty well. But with all these expectations I watched it and I can say, Damn. First of all it gives American animated movie vibes if you know what I mean, the humor is very normie at times but it's competent. The music was fine nothing to write home about but it was at least catchy, I liked the villain and the movie has some themes about morality with the black haired hot Korean demon dude but I was just thinking why does he get the sappy backstory and get's portrayed as a hero while other demons who probably also have a sad backstory get slaughtered like cannon fodder, is it because Mr. Hot Demon is hot? And the white/Asian girls are already foaming and moaning to his every on-screen appearance. But on a serious note this film spoke to be on a personal level with my parents being of two different ethnic backgrounds. With my final thoughts I would like to say that wow I am not gay but as soon as I saw the evil demon boy band I was...uh anyways I think Bobby was cool and probably the best character and I give it a 6/10 because it's still a little cringe, bye!",literal

"A younger Gibbs great idea didn't fly though I'm a 30 year fan of actor Mark Harmon this may have been a great concept of a prequel, but the first episode, which was two hours was too long and I kept losing interest. Besides the fact I had to keep reminding myself who was Gibbs. It was not clearly evident in the actor chosen to play Leroy Gibbs, His son was in NCIS why not him in this prequel. I'm sure they went through many possible actors to play Gibbs, but I don't think Austin was the right pick he's very green and has done very few roles .Although I was shocked when I looked Austin up to find out he's from Connecticut near my hometown . He played the pilot held in Russian spy movie ""Bridge of Spies"" with Tom Hanks I hardly remember Austin. Not all the NCIS spin offs are good Hawaii, Sydney, Los Angeles get ""F"" too much political correctness and diversity and little on actual talent in the casting.

"Completely Hilarious and Full of Quality One Punch Man is one of the funniest and most entertaining anime series I've ever watched in my entire life. Even though it is a newly started anime, the first episode was highly anticipated throughout the anime community, and it was definitely golden in my eyes, with high quality animations and a hilarious story line. The main character, his enemies and the life he lives is a complete mockery of other popular anime plots, both from recent and present anime's. The lines and the dialogs in the episodes are full of puns and jokes, with a satiric sense of comedy injected into them. I highly recommend that you watch this anime, as it will definitely at least bring a smile to your face, and you won't regret the time you spent to watch it.",literal
"A Poignant Picture Of Betrayal, Desire And Reconciliation Regretting You is a poignant picture of betrayal, desire and reconciliation. While it leans on stereotypical characters and trite storylines, director Josh Boone's willingness to embrace these clichés is ultimately what brings the film its heart and timelessness.

Set against the idyllic backdrop of the American South, Regretting You follows a seemingly-perfect family struck not only by an unimaginable tragedy, but by revelations of truths that threaten to destroy the fragile balance its survivors have found. When Morgan (Allison Williams) attempts to restore a sense of normalcy to her teenage daughter's (McKenna Grace) life, both find themselves on parallel paths of healing and self-discovery.

Regretting You tackles heartbreaking themes such as grief and deception, but projects them through a heavily romanticized lens. The creative team chooses to emphasize the optimism and togetherness that usually follow acceptance, only briefly acknowledging the emotional aftermath of a loss. Love is equally idealized, painted as an all-withstanding entity that exists in the form of letters and watermelon Jolly Ranchers, in tearful confessions in the rain, golden sunsets and starry skies. Conflict and suffering are given inadequate weight; despite its dramatic premise - Regretting You is a vision of perfection, not realism. However, this rejection of authenticity creates a fleeting atmosphere of hope and comfort. The film is an invitation to safety, taking viewers directly to the picturesque, imagined worlds we retreat to when reality's light becomes too harsh. The creators don't glorify pain; they simply opt for a portrayal shallow enough that it allowed me to immerse myself in the story for the time that it lasted, then walk away without its emotional weight - a meaningful but ephemeral escape from reality. The majority of Regretting You is a sentimental portrait, composed of overused cliches and excessively sentimental exchanges, but this allows the film's few gems of both comedy and true drama to stand out. For example, Allison Williams delivers an especially captivating performance upon discovering that a loved one has been unfaithful. The classical characters carry a feeling of nostalgia, while the film's predictability creates a sense of tragic irony that makes it impossible not to get lost in.

Regretting You is a reminder that when life hands you lemons, make lemonade. Beautiful things are born from the worst of circumstances; losing something cherished can be the beginning of something else. Your loved ones can help you build a new life, start over, and, with time, learn to heal.

I give Regretting You 3.5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults. The film releases in theaters on October 24, 2025.

"Too many difficult to like characters and some very unfunny comedy sink this one. ""Is This Thing On?"" is a new film directed by Bradley Cooper and Cooper also plays a relatively minor role in the story. I saw it at the Philadelphia Film Festival yesterday.

Alex and Tess (Will Arnett and Laura Dern) are married but they are separating. Neither seems to have that much reason to separate other than, perhaps, boredom. However, Alex copes with this in a strange way. Instead of seeking therapy, he decides on a lark to do standup comedy! As for the wife, she copes by returning to her first love, volleyball.

So why did I give this one a paltry five? Well, two main reasons. First, Arnett is supposed to be doing standup and people like his act...but the act has barely a laugh in it at any time! They really needed to get a comedian to punch up Arnett's act and it just doesn't make sense why anyone would want to see it. In contrast, the very first episode of ""The Marvelous Miss Maisel"", the main character was freaking hilarious the first time she did standup! Second, the characters are all people I either strongly disliked (Alex, Tess, their extended family and friends) or was completely ambivalent towards (the gay couple and the kids). It;s a real shame, as the message that EVENTUALLY comes out in the film is an important one...that folks in a marriage might just need to focus on a hobby or avocation which gives them satisfaction, not just expecting their spouse to provide this. Overall, it sure seems like a film which could used a bit of a re-write and I can't see going to the trouble of seeing this in theaters...more a film to watch on Netflix or some other streaming service...if at all.",figurative
"January Embers Stephen King adaptations can be a mixed bag. For every masterpiece, A Shawshank Redemption and The Shining there are other productions that sit opposite, CELL, Bag of Bones and the deplorable Mist TV series to name a few. King has a huge body of work and some times it takes a film director to make or break his writing for a cinematic audience.

Andy Muschietti and screenwriter Cary Fukunaga announced a cinema version of IT in 2014. Muschietti had directed MAMA and Fukunaga had gone into bat for Woody Harrelson and Matt Mcconaughey for the first season of True Detective. It was an interesting peering and then the production went quiet. until the first trailer.

Based on the the Novel by King and the television version which featured Tim Curry as the clown antagonist obsessed with killing children the question was; would the trailer that broke the internet match up to everything read and seen before? and if so would it be better?After two full versions Andy Muschietti had a lot of work to do.

Bill, Ben , Beverley, Richie, Mike, Eddie and Stanley live in the fictional town Derry Maine. They are all very early teenagers and find comfort among each other and are very close. Early on Bill loses his brother and it soon becomes obvious that Derry houses a demon so evil that adults cannot see it leaving it to the teens to do something about it. This is a very Stephen King story.

After a relentless death that will go down in the halls of Horror as a great film murder. This becomes a very adult version of the story compared to the mini series but not so the novel which is even more adult. Stephen King WTF !!. The Clown PENNYWISE is pivotal early and Bill Skisgard is owning it in the first few seconds which is important not just for the story but also the cinematography sound and general tension.

Muschietti has done an amazing job. Stephen King has mentioned he did not expect this to be as good as it is and he is right. This is a fantastic horror film but in saying it pays homage to the classic 80's and also addresses the issues of teens growing up ( Well almost ) and creates an on screen entity that future films other that the sequel will struggle to compete with.

PENNYWISE is not nice, Hannibal Lecter not nice.

A film that has had the highest opening of any horror film ever and it deserves this, We deserve it , This is the mini series on steroids and fills the gap between the three. Smart acting directing and writing for a simple horror film which has fallen into very caring hands.

Bring on Chapter 2...It's going to get very nasty.",figurative

"WHAT- THE CAST IN THIS MOVIE....couldn't have been cast better than who was chosen for each individual role. As someone who has seen the stage play and read the books, I was interested to see what direction Jon would go with this second film. And he didn't disappoint, with a beautiful combination of the two. The love shared on set was oozing from these powerhouse performances. Cynthia and Ariana, wow. That's all I can say. Still trying to collect my thoughts fully but, just watch it. It's a vocal and emotional masterpiece. Take a box of tissues. 5 wasn't enough.",figurative
"Bob Merrick reminds one of Ethan Couch In 2013, reports arose of a teenage boy in Texas named Ethan Couch who had been drinking and driving with some friends and accidentally killed some people in the process. His lawyer made the argument that his privileged upbringing gave him no sense of right and wrong, resulting in a slap on the wrist for the boy. This scenario has become known as affluenza.

The spoiled protagonist in Lloyd Douglas's ""Magnificent Obsession"" is kind of like that, in that his irresponsibility resulted in someone else's death. I watched the 1935 and 1954 versions back-to-back. The original is obviously the more serious one, while Douglas Sirk's remake has more of a glossy quality. I understand that Sirk's movies are now seen as a critique of the supposed idealism of the US lifestyle, and that their look inspired Todd Haynes's ""Far from Heaven"". I can see that.

As for the content, the cast puts in good enough performances. Every time that Agnes Moorehead's character was on screen, I though ""Stop encouraging Tabitha to use witchcraft!"". Anyway, respectable movie.",literal
"Absolutely brilliant This is one of the best shows I have ever watched (and I watch some of the best on TV - The West Wing, all of the Law and Orders, House MD). On Wednesday nights, I use to watch ""The West Wing"", but then that moved to Sunday. I started to watch ""Head Cases"", but to my great disappointment (though not surprise) that was cancelled. So, on a whim, I tried out ""Criminal Minds"". I have never made a better TV decision.

Criminal Minds is a psychological thriller that keeps your undivided attention. Like Law & Order, no one character gets the direct star treatment. I have seen seven episodes, and I still do not have a favorite character (which is highly unusual for me). I love them all. Every single week, this is the only show I can hardly wait for.

If you like plots that keep you thinking and guessing while having plenty of physical and mention action, this show is definitely for you.",figurative

"Pretty good Heard this movie was an awesome old school action movie so checked it out, and it is good. Even if it is very over the top.

On the plus side the movie gives the audience what its been starved off. Brutal, adult action with minimal CGI. And with plenty of lines like ""we're lucky he didn't kill more of us"" it'll put a smile on your face if you miss 80's/90's style action.

On the negative side all the bad guys are terrible shots, and the hero is almost indestructible. Which maybe takes a bit of suspence out of the movie. Especially at the end. Much like modern superhero movies then? At least it got it half right.",literal

"It's a movie that's easy to enjoy while sitting down and watching with free action. Four years after the surprise hit Nobody introduced the world to the suburban dad with a dark past, Hutch Mansell (Bob Odenkirk) returns in a sequel that doubles down on the first film's winning formula. Directed by Timo Tjahjanto and written by returning scribe Derek Kolstad, Nobody 2 is a gleefully violent, fast-paced, and darkly humorous romp that, while lacking some of the original's novelty, proves to be a more than worthy follow-up.

The film picks up with Hutch still living a double life. To pay off the massive debt he incurred by wiping out a Russian mob syndicate, he's now working as an assassin for the shadowy organization known only as ""The Barber."" This work, however, is taking a toll on his family life. Hutch's wife, Becca (Connie Nielsen), and children are becoming distant, so in an effort to reconnect, he plans a family vacation to a waterpark in the small tourist town of Plummerville-a place he remembers from his own childhood. Of course, this is a Nobody movie, so the peaceful getaway is short-lived. A minor altercation at an arcade escalates into a full-blown confrontation with the town's criminal element, led by a corrupt theme park owner (John Ortiz) and his menacing sheriff (Colin Hanks). This small-town syndicate, in turn, is merely a front for a ruthless, unhinged crime boss named Lendina, played with scenery-chewing delight by Sharon Stone.

The true star of the show remains Bob Odenkirk. He seamlessly slips back into the role of Hutch Mansell, a man who just wants to live a quiet life but is constantly pulled back into a world of brutal violence. Odenkirk's performance perfectly balances the character's exhausted resignation with the explosive, almost-unhinged glee he gets from dispatching his foes. The film wisely understands that its core appeal lies in watching this seemingly ordinary man become an engine of chaotic destruction.

While the plot is admittedly formulaic and serves primarily as a vehicle for a new round of meticulously choreographed mayhem, the action is top-notch. Director Timo Tjahjanto brings his signature brand of bone-crunching, over-the-top violence to the franchise. The set pieces are inventive, taking full advantage of the amusement park setting. We see Hutch using everything from water slides to ball pits to a funhouse as his personal battlefield, each sequence more outlandish and fun than the last. The movie doesn't take itself too seriously, embracing its own absurdity and delivering a high-octane spectacle that will satisfy any action fan.

The supporting cast, including Christopher Lloyd as Hutch's dad and RZA as his brother, Harry, also return, adding to the film's unique charm. The film smartly weaves them into the action, turning the final confrontation into a bizarre, family-bonding bloodbath. Sharon Stone is a standout as the film's primary antagonist, delivering a performance that is both terrifying and wildly entertaining.

In conclusion, Nobody 2 is a fantastic example of a sequel that understands its audience. It delivers exactly what fans of the original loved: more of Bob Odenkirk's brilliant performance, more visceral and creative fight scenes, and a relentless pace that never lets up. While it may not surprise you in terms of story, it is a hugely entertaining and satisfying slice of brutal action cinema that proves the Nobody franchise has plenty of gas left in the tank. It's a perfect popcorn flick for a night out, a relentless and fun ride from start to finish.",literal
"Season 2: 5/10 & Season 1: 10/10 Season 2 is pulled in too many directions with boring and seemingly pointless plot lines. The writing is sloppy, and the storyline is flailing all over the place. I had a hard time sitting in place to finish the first 4 episodes, mainly because of the following:

(1) Bruno: His plot line with Enid gets way too much screen time, and Bruno is a boring flat character. After their first couple scenes, I'm quite sure the audience got enough - we don't need to be banged in the head with it over and over when there's literally nothing new to learn.

(2) Slurp: How I hate this plot line so much. Why does Slurp get so much screen time? What's the point of the zombie? Slurp had better be integral to the mystery plot line. Even if Slurp is integral, they still devoted too much screen time to this. I literally walked away to do laundry during these scenes and sometimes forgot to come back.

(3) Agnes DeMille - The actress is fantastic, but the plot lines are ridiculous. What was up with the stunt that almost kill Enid? If the ""prank"" was not so brutal, then sure. But the prank was deadly, and this firmly puts Agnes into ""psycho crazy"" territory vs potential friend territory. Wednesday's blase reaction to Agnes' prank doesn't align with her character, especially given how Wednesday seemingly is protective over Enid like Pugsley, and with Pugsley, she nearly killed the entire swim team with piranhas for having done less. She would have reported or taken revenge on Agnes.

(4) Tyler Galpin: Arguably the most complex character on the show outside of Wednesday, and yet they sideline his character - what a loss for the show and for the audience. Like if what the writers have revealed to us is true (ie Thornhill controlled the Hyde), aren't the actions of the Hyde due to Thornhill and not Tyler? I'm so confused with Wednesday's total write off of Tyler and this doesn't align with her liking for darkness and internally sympathetic nature. Outside of this misalignment, I think they should have threaded this continuing storyline more into this season to maintain continuity. Because as-is this show is flailing all over the place.",figurative
"Good 80's fun It's just plain good fun, nothing to dislike about this unless you have no sense of humour. Solid 80's comedy.",literal
"There's a lot to unpack It's been years since I wrote a review on IMDb. For that matter, I wiped my youthful, naive review slate clean a few years ago. But I felt compelled to write one for this for a number of reasons.

I just watched these first two episodes today. Mainly cuz I do respect Mike White, but mostly because I adore a properly done dark comedy maybe more than anything... and if Steve Zahn is in it, I'll probably watch it.

So first off, I can actually understand people's confusion to this. I saw a few other reviews that said ""this isn't funny"", ""these characters are awful"", ""was Lani's water breaking supposed to be funny?"".

I get this reaction if you go in expecting a standard ""dark comedy"". But much like HBO's masterpiece ""Barry"", it's intensely dark in all of the strangest places. (Is ""Barry"" more laugh out loud funny than ""The White Lotus""? YES. Is something like ""Barry"" just slightly more of a crowd-pleaser in terms of its flawless execution? YES. Do I consider ""Barry"" one of the greatest shows ever made? YES. Is ""The White Lotus"" in the same league? NO, not necessarily. But it certainly deserves respect). However, I've found myself more intrigued by the dark drama of these characters (and the inherent ugliness... or social disconnect, rather) and surprised by the strangely layered comedy that has come through.

Strangely layered. I have a hunch that this series would be funnier on a second viewing because it's certainly a confounding yet intriguing little mystery.

There aren't punchlines. No. That's not where the comedy comes from. It seems, at least after the first 2 episodes, that a lot of the comedy is coming from pain or anger or hesitation or fear or simply being uncomfortable.

I laughed at very strange things during this... and I felt for the characters as well, despite (as many others have pointed out) that they're mostly unlikable. But I like this. It forces you to reflect and think about who these people are. Why do we need to like or root for our main characters? As long as they're interesting... that's all I care about. (Look at the woefully underrated ""The Founder"" starring Michael Keaton about McDonald's. At the end of the day, there's not much likable about his portrayal of Ray Kroc... but it was an excellent movie with an excellent performance).

I, personally, find the flawed/unlikable characters more interesting. And I'm always surprised when I can get emotionally behind someone I either don''t understand or puts me off.

To answer those questions above... was Lani's water breaking supposed to be funny? In my opinion, no... not at all. In fact, if it was a cheaper comedy, they would'v'e had Armond slip and fall in the fluid. But that's not what happened. Because it's not that kind of comedy.

This is a drama under the thin guise of a dark comedy. But it's working for me. And, again, I understand where it may not for many. These characters are awful in many ways. But I feel there are complexities unfolding that might turn out great. I'm immensely enjoying the mystery of who is the body being put on the place in Scene 1 of episode 1.

To be in paradise and still be in a personal Hell is something I find to be an incredibly juxtaposed position to be in. The idea that there is so much confusion and so little happiness while having the luxury to even be at a resort like that in the first place is a fascinating concept.

Not to feel sorry for the wealthy, upper ""elite"". But to prove, in many ways, that money doesn't buy happiness.

I'm excited to see where this goes. Will it let me down mid-way like most shows do? Maybe. But for now, as the 3rd episode airs tonight...

...Color me intrigued.",figurative
"For the love of Sirk The first of the run of lush Cinemascope dramas Sirk did for Universal is this re-make of the 1935 Stahl film, with Rock Hudson and Jane Wyman this time in the leading roles. Hudson is the selfish, rich layabout who discovers a ""new way of living"" only after he indirectly causes both the death of Wymna's husband and her blindness. And they proceed to fall in love! Only in Hollywood, I guess, but this crazy plot is miraculously made touching and real by Sirk, who films it in glorious colour compositions. The constant Sirk theme of the dissatisfied, idle rich is portrayed well by Hudson, whose movie-star hunk image is the perfect facade for Sirk to tear down in showing the initial emptiness of Bob Merrick's life. He and Wyman would do better work in ""All That Heaven Allows"" a year later, but this may be the better test of whether or not you ""get"" Sirk. If you can look past the outlandish plot, no, actually look inside it and find depth, you'll know you like Sirk.",figurative
"It's not bad The biggest problem that Hazbin Hotel has is the limited time given to each episode. The plot is being rushed through at the speed of sound which doesn't allow for meaningful moments or action sequences to be convincing. The premise is a bit confusing since it brands itself as a kind of redemption show but that is not what the majority of the conflict is about. It presents you with all of these heavy topics relating to abuse of power and forgets about its redemption themes until a character makes a side remark. Going forward with a season 2, I hope they give the show and its characters more time to be properly fleshed out.

Aside from the general pacing issues, the animation is solid and feels very fluid. I can understand some criticisms about lack of differing body-types but that is what the style is. However, it may not be to everyone's taste.

The sound design and music is very good. I am a big fan of Broadway musicals and this show hit that sweet sound for me. The one issue I had about the sound design is the voice acting particularly in the first few episodes. One characters voice, Vaggie, sounded a little bit too monotone and sharp compared to the rest of cast. This didn't seem intentional either. This is just a small nitpick.

Overall, this show is very fun to watch despite its pacing flaws.",literal
"Eh Sorry folksnothing blowing up; no tense shootouts, or squeamishly decomposing bodies laying around some gutter somewherethis show is not for me. The cast is OK and the acting is better than mediocre. Like many shows now-a-days, the weekly scripts are more skewed towards progressive issues than how people react to cancer. Since it is not a 'guy show', I will let much of the touchy-feely garbage go. It just wouldn't be fair for me to tear this program down. For me, the script seems to be irritating and really juvenile. I will probably not watch this show ever again, although I am sure there are many people out in the world who really like it. Respecting those who enjoy the program, I will not rattle the cage. Since this is not my favorite show venue, I will give it a couple of stars.",literal
"Better than I even Imagined! #SixSeasonsAndAMovie please!

Netflix, pick this series up for more episodes because holy cow, you hit it out of the park this time.

Ortega is PERFECT as Wednesday, I loved her in X and I love her in this.

The title says it all: WEDNESDAY! This is her picture, her character always steals the scenes both on the small screen and in the Tim Burton films, this series time jumps us to her late teens and hits the ground running with mysteries, adventure, and spooky macabre humor.

Tim Burton directs the first four episodes, and the score is by Danny Elfman!

I am enamored with this series and can't wait for it to get picked up for more seasons, and the potential spin offs of the other lesser featured (this is Wednesday's show of focus, after all) should get fans hyped for an eventual Addams cinematic universe using this cast. The casting is perfect across the board, and I love Christna Ricci's character, such a sweet nod to the OG!",literal
"Ari Aster's New Divisive Movie Unlike many horror fans, I have never seen an Ari Aster movie, but I have heard great things about him. I had to check out ""Eddington"" due to all the discourse around it. This is a very polarizing movie, so some will love it while others hate it. The movie stars Joaquin Phoenix, Pedro Pascal, Emma Stone, and Deirdre O'Connell. Taking place during the beginning of Covid and the BLM movement, a standoff between the sheriff and current mayor causes things to get out of hand in Eddington, New Mexico.

I love the buzz around this movie because it means people are talking about it. It definitely is a thought-provoking movie because so much happens. At the same time, not all the discourse is peaceful. It was a very weird experience watching this, and there is a lot to unpack. Joaquin Phoenix and Pedro Pascal give great performances in this movie. I thought Joaquin was slightly better, but we also followed him the whole movie. Ari Aster shows his talent by creating a great technical movie. There were many scenes filled with anxiety and uncomfortable moments with the use of sound and camera movement. The little carnage in this movie looked great as well. Also, the writing created many surprisingly funny dark moments.

With a 2 hour 30 minute runtime, there has to be a lot to fill the time. The story didn't fail to fill the time, but I didn't feel like it wrapped up neatly by the end. I thought the movie would have been slightly better if they had cut out the final 10 minutes or so. This would have helped wrap things up as well as cut down on the length. Emma Stone and Austin Butler seemed wasted. They have very little screen time, and the movie wouldn't change if they were removed. I am unsure of the message being told. The events of the pandemic are extreme versions within this film. Both main characters aren't great people, so there is no one to root for. However, this may be the point.

""Eddington"" certainly needs a rewatch before the end of the year, but it's not a movie I particularly want to rewatch. My favorite part of the movie was the mayoral campaign and even the Covid setting was neat. It's a hard movie to recommend due to the varying opinions people have. However, Ari Aster fans should check this out still.",literal

"The hope for Marvel is still there!! I genuinely enjoyed the movie from start to finish! Honestly, I expected Vanessa and Joseph to be a bit underwhelming in their roles, but they actually pulled them off really well-I was pleasantly surprised! Pedro, on the other hand, was the one who gave me that meeh reaction, lol. I was expecting more from him, especially with all the hype.

The CGI in some scenes, particularly with Mr. Fantastic, felt a bit off-you could really tell it was CGI, which took me out of it for a moment. But Julia Garner absolutely amazed me as Shalla-Bal! She owned every scene she was in and definitely stood out.

It was definitely worth watching in IMAX-the visuals, the energy, and the overall experience just hit differently on the big screen.

Overall, it was a solid movie and a step in the right direction! I'm super hyped to see what Marvel brings next with Avengers: Doomsday!",literal
"Holds interest, but Just about every Dick Wolf production includes time consuming for chase scenes, initiated by Law Enforcement calling out the perps name from a distance of 12' or more. In turn the perps have ample time to avoid being apprehended easily.

Plus another common storyline thread is to have one of the prime characters always balk at taking time off for injuries, being personally involved in the investigation, or for inappropriate actions. Balking to the point of insubordination.

Also, the investigative pairings/partners always find a reason to hide personal issues, which in turn affects their investigation. In real life, when people are teamed together for 8 - 12 hour days, they're not hiding anything from their partner. Every detail becomes known.",literal
"To be taken once a year, with a pinch of salt The Running Man is one of those films that if overwatched, would become boring and depressing even.

My advice is to watch it maybe once or twice a year with a couple of mates and a few drinks.

In todays climate of TV Media domination and the capitalist mode in society it really does work as a revisionist social commentary, post 1980s-boom. Forget that though!  There are other brilliant and better reasons to watch this film.

Schwarzenegger is on top form as Ben ""The Butcher of Bakersfield"" Richards, and the inclusion of Bond-belting one liners was completely inspired-thety are truly leg-end-dary (with his rant to Killian over a camera the main highlight).

The design of the stalkers is authentically American, and mirrors the characterizations seen in the PC 'Gladiators' TV show, and the WWE as well. Buzz-saw's grisly end will chill any viewer to the core (as a foot note, why does his death stand out as particularly disturbing in what is ostensibly an upbeat actioner with a bitter sense of humour?)

Jesse Venturer and Sven Ole Thorssen are great as backing muscle (and are Arnies buds in real life), and its even got Mick Fleetwood in it too! What more could you ask for?

I highly recommend the Running Man if you're looking for a great piece of entertaining action, with a glossty finish and some great characters. Just don't expect an education from it (at least on surface value).

Quality, I bloody love it actually.  You will too unless you're a thesp. 7/10",literal
"I Wanted to Like It After watching the numerous promos for this series, I was looking forward to watching it. Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed. It is another one of those fake documentaries which supposedly follows the main characters around with a film crew and cameras. There were some humorous moments in the first two episodes I viewed. Regrettably, Wendi McLendon Covey ruined any enjoyment that I might have had in viewing the series. Her extremely over the top acting style is particularly off putting to my liking. She ruined every scene in which she appeared. This is not the first show that have I stopped watching due to her scene chewing antics.",literal
"Boring It took Rick and Morty one episode to discuss the problems and excitement of the same setting, while Pluribus spent a season on it. The feeling of novelty faded away so quickly that I get so bored in the third episode. I was keen on Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul for excellent and amazing plot from a normal settings, while Pluribus comes to the opposite end - avant-garde setting, but boring plots. I can hardly imagine how Carol could do to change the situation, especially as she was set to be an unbelievably choleric person. The Carol character is so repellent that I have no interest in her (totally opposite of pragmatic and capable Kim). I could predict every reaction from her and she's just like a volcano ready to erupt at every second.",figurative
"WHY? Plain and simple, no one wants to watch anything with Kim K. In it. People are tired and saturated. She is NOT an actress. Her roles in AHS and now this are exactly the same and not a stretch.

I predict no second season.",literal
"Now you don't see the magic This movie commits a cardinal sin.

It makes the original cast incompetent, such that the new crew can appear better.

It is to a point where it downgrades and makes fun of the original. Showing them unable to get out of cuffs, figure out extremely simple puzzles or heck even perform most magic.

The reason for this is simple: There is a new set of 3 main chars. They want them to appear competent, so they are the ones performing the magic, the ones solving puzzles e.g. Leaving the old gang to be and feel pointless. You could remove them from the movie, and the plot would still work - except with less gags poking fun at the ""old magicians"".

We have a little bit of magic in one scene where they ""show"" of to each other. Reminiscent somewhat of the first movie meetup. But thinking more about it and much of that scene makes no sense.

In general though, this movie prefers set dressing and hinting at magic, rather than showing much magic. There is significantly more brutal beating of various cops and heck even Interpol - who all are apparently utterly untrained and coordinated.

So yea, real fire to buildings, beating cops, causing car accidents and potentially risking the life of others, that is the ""magic"" here.

Of course there is a trick and twist. It makes very little sense and trying to think about the plot for more than 10 seconds almost makes your brain hurt from how extremely dumb it must assume the watcher to be.

The plot holes are big enough to escape through, so I guess there is some magic there.

While tempting to go into each one, I won't bother. Watch it when it goes to streaming and judge those yourself.

I didn't expect much of a third movie.. but something more the lines of the 2'end. But this - this might be one of the worst movies I've watched in recent years. Primarily for how it neglects the previous movies and degrade the abilities of the originals.

The should have made this movie about the new 3 chars from the start. Set in the same universe, same plot idea - maybe hints to the old crew - but not involve them. It would have been a better movie that way.

Oh yea - I also do love when a movie sequel bait hard at the end.

It currently still has surprisingly high rates - I can only assume that some people forgot the previous movies in the years that passed.

But I am not expecting a sequel, of if they do - just stick the new cast and stop ruining the old.",literal
"Give it time! I know I know, we've seen so many versions of Robin Hood but this is a refreshing take to say the least.

"Can someone explain why this show is rated so poorly? The first episode was truly captivating, and it gave me mixed emotions. In the beginning, he struggled with fear and pain whenever he had to draw his sword because of his traumatic past. His daughter died from illness, and his wife also suffered from the same sickness. He went through so much. Emotionally and financially and even considered selling his sword just to buy medicine for his dying daughter. Sadly, it was already too late.

The acting is smooth, the cinematography is excellent, and the production quality is impressive.

The second episode was even more amazing. The story took a wild turn as he completely lost control and became Kukusho, the man-slayer, once again. The main actor delivered an incredible performance, especially in the action scenes. His moves reminded me of his role in the movie ""Pibble,"" where he played an assassin.

I'm honestly surprised this series has such a low rating. The first two episodes alone already show one of the best storylines ever created. I don't understand why it received a low rating. Can someone explain why this show is rated so poorly?",literal

Even the bloody patient's room is designed exactly like the ones in House!

Didn't anyone in the production team know that House MD is itself based on Sherlock Holmes; that the character of Sherlock Holmes was inspired by a real life doctor?

"Great Acting, Interesting Dynamic The show is a great concept. It shows two parallel main story line perspectives between the FBI Task team, and the family man criminal. Being subjected to both sides really expands the concept of traditional investigative shows. The focus is the interpersonal character development. It is a drama, and you see the motives and emotions of the characters. Most shots are face shots. The acting and casting is really well done. I was not familiar with Tom Pelphrey, but damn that dude can act. Ruffalo is always good. It's a great show by my standards. 8/10 is a great rating. Waiting on the next episode.",literal
"Gibbs could not have served in a Desert War Episode 4 shows Gibbs in a Desert setting that is under attack. I can't remember any thing like this in the early 1990s. Why did they make up this Fantasy? I guess the writers are too young to have lived at that time and are poor students of history.

I still like the show. In the past, I spent a lot of time in Southern California. It looks like they actually are filming near Camp Pendleton. And the level of technology seems right for the time period.

I think it is worth watching but I wish they had continued NCIS Hawaii. I have also spent time there and enjoyed the scenery. Also I really liked the cast.",literal
"Too much story, not enough action I understand it is more of a back story for the original franchise. However they spend too much time, as most series do these days, on the personal side stories instead of what then viewers want. The show is supposed to be crime investigations and they have some of that but not enough in my opinion. I like to see items related to finding out how the main character became who he is but too much time is spent on that aspect.

I agree with some others that the narrative part is also too much. Once again if they stick to the main purpose of a series like this and focus on solving crimes instead of making it like reading a novel I would give it a higher rating.",literal
"Not quite a fantastic snore, but nothing we haven't seen be-four. I must admit that 'The Fantastic Four: First Steps (2025)' left me a little underwhelmed. Despite taking place in a retro-futuristic pocket universe separate to the rest of the MCU, the theoretically bright and colourful picture just lacks a genuine sense of wonder and is oddly dull considering how delightfully odd some parts of its world are. It doesn't really have any pep, any zip or zeal. It's a very paint-by-numbers effort that may be the first truly insular Marvel movie since 'Iron Man (2008)', but is still undeniably a generic superhero blockbuster. It feels very small and insignificant in some ways, despite its literally world-ending stakes and a powerful potential personal loss hovering over the eponymous four, and a lot of it just feels like highly produced fan fiction to me. Much of that feeling comes from the fact that, despite individually being confident and charismatic actors, the cast never quite gel together, their chemistry constantly seeming performative rather than natural. Pedro Pascal isn't quite what I think of when I think of Reed Richards, for example, and he's strangely flat here given how magnetically charming he is in real life. Vanessa Kirby gives her character more depth and dignity than we're used to (it's ironic that The Invisible Woman is arguably the most visible female character in any of Marvel's ensembles, although Yelena is also strong and complex lead), but she doesn't get anything meaty to chew on despite there being quite an emotionally draining central conflict she's directly involved in. Joseph Quinn isn't quite as quippy and delightfully jerk-ish as I'd expect, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach isn't afforded any opportunity of an arc thanks to the story's post-accident setting. Really, two of the four eponymous teammates feel like they're just there for decoration, and the two that get more focus mostly come across as lifeless and uninteresting. That's perhaps not entirely fair, but I can't deny that the flick fails to move me in any real way and that its underlying themes are so subtle they barley register. It isn't really about anything, nor do its characters go on any meaningful arcs, and it doesn't live up to the campy potential of its setting or source material. We could really do with something that isn't so self-serious from Marvel, something with a notably different tone and comedy that isn't based around meek quips you can see coming a mile away. This isn't that, though. For all its promises of being its own thing, it's devastatingly homogeneous. The thing is, though, that the movie isn't as bad as I've made it seem. It doesn't really get going until an exciting sequence set in space shakes the dust off and acts as the highlight of the entire affair, showcasing the formidable prowess of Julia Garner's Shalla-Bal (who makes Ralph Ineson's sedentary Galactus seem even less interesting than he already does) and easily putting you on the edge of your seat. The finale is also entertaining in its own generic way, essentially staying just one step ahead of the customary 'giant beam in the sky' ending by having said beam be a big bloke with a booming voice. It presents a compelling use of its characters' powers, combining them in enjoyable ways and really seeming to push their relatively restrained abilities to the limit. Most of the fantastic four's crime fighting is restricted to an opening montage that features snippets of showdowns far more interesting, albeit less 'important', than the one they're involved with for the duration of the plot, but the midsection of the movie is fairly fun in its depiction of its alternative-world science bringing every nation on the planet together. So, like I said, this isn't a bad film. It's just much a more middle-of-the-road experience than I'd like it to be, and that saps all the excitement out of both it and the thought that this team is going to be a major player in the MCU going forwards. It certainly isn't fantastic, let's put it like that. It's fun enough for what it is, though, and I'd probably say it's better than 'Captain America: Brave New World (2025)' now that I've had a bit of time to reflect on that film (it's nowhere near as strong an effort as 'Thunderbolts* (2025)', however). At this point, I don't quite know if ""good enough"" is good enough, especially considering that Marvel have been sort of floundering post 'Avengers: Endgame (2019)' and need to get back on track in time for their next big crossover event (which is unlikely now). For example, this pales in comparison to the sheer fun and emotional resonance of 'Superman (2025)', which is perhaps the first time in over ten years that DC have genuinely bested Marvel. As its own thing, it's a perfectly fine and often fairly fun superhero movie that conforms to its genre but is comfortable because of it. As Marvel's Hail Mary to get people back on board in time for 'Avengers: Doomsday (2026)', it doesn't cut the mustard.",literal
"Did not meet my expectations I went into the cinema thinking that this was going to be a very good horror film based on the critic reviews and public reception. However I was sorely disappointed. It's not a bad film by any means and has plenty of good scenes, great cinematography and pretty good story telling.

However my problem was for a horror film it only had like 3 or 4 scenes that could be considered scary or horrifying. The rest was just the main cast investigating the disappearances. I also found the story incredibly slow paced for what it was. The key events that occur aren't that many but due to the many perspective changes and going back to a previous point in the story multiple times it just ended up feeling like I slow crawl to the conclusion. So tbh I'd say it's like a 6.5, better than mid but didn't really live up to the hype.",figurative
"An entertaining romp It would be a bit strong to call Materialists a 'modern Pride and Prejudice' - but there's a deeply inhaled whiff of that old contest between marrying for love or marrying for money. The film doesn't solve it (the ending can be guessed early on and is what the audience will want rather than any objective analysis). What it does do though is entertain thoroughly for a couple of hours and provide a clever enough dialogue for most of that to raise it above the standard rom-com.

Dakota Johnson plays Lucy Mason, a dating exec, matchmaking for New York's finest (a.k.a. Rich and good-looking). Two men, Chris Evans and Pedro Pascal, both want to date her, and both exuding best intentions and deep sincerity. Personally I don't think Lucy should take either of them if this were the real world, but it's not, it's a beautiful, magical Manhattan merry-go-round of lovers-for-life and wannabes. Throw in some dancing and it could almost be a fine romance for Fred and Ginger.

I'm pleased it didn't have any dancing: it manages to keep its feet on the ground long enough to relate to - if only for those at a distance of earning less than a couple of million a year - which also means that for anyone without half of Wall Street in the bank the small element of fantasy can be considered entirely justifiable!

Celine Song has made a second hit (after the beautifully crafted Past Lives) with just enough candour to make us question ourselves without intruding with a virtue-signalling message. We can ask ourselves what does love consist of, and does love conquer all, or we can just go with the flow.

Materialists is not a ""classic"" in the sense of Audrey Hepburn in Breakfast at Tiffany's or Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman: but the cast do the script proud and make it a thoroughly enjoyable. Don't go and see it if you are desperate for love, have just joined a dating app, are uncomfortable with your own attractiveness or inclined to take romcoms too seriously: but as a night out with a partner that you love it's worth the price of admission, or even just with a friend who likes dissecting the issues over coffee afterwards. I hope that is a reasonably helpful balance of 'materialism'!",figurative

* Poor Script
* Sterotype Characters ( Mexican Thugs - Alcoholic and widowed father )
* Underdeveloped relatioshipes ( especially between the cop daughter and her father ) and by the way what's the point of Katheryn Winnck's character ?? she was underused and totally wasted here .
All in all . The movie is watchable entertainement but nothing special and for Liam it's time to hang up the gloves you got old for this stuff .",literal
"Always a classic Maura Tierney is a good actress but her character as lieutenant or captain is confusing. Her character is the boss but she interviews suspects walks the beat with her detectives, interviews suspects w/her detectives who have partners. Its the same with Law & Order SVU's character Olivia Benson, played by Mariska Hargitay, what is her role too, she is too involved as a captain &now a lieutenant. I know its to give that actress more speaking parts b/c she is the star but make it make sense. If that is the case then why promote her give a role that makes sense to do so or create a new role to put her in. Overall I like the show but I noticed they don't have a lot of diversity. Also the show choses to have one black cast member on each show but no more. Its so worried about appealing to middle america it does want to be bold and brave so it excludes. I like the show.",literal
"I hate that I laughed! I honestly hated that I laughed! It was so unexpectedly good but you have to get through that first episode. It was worth the watch though.

"Season 5 is dreadful The scripting is really bad. It's fine to make up your own story to some extent -- but the injection of politically correct claptrap that sticks out like a sore thumb spoils the whole thing.

"This show has filled the Breaking Bad gap in my heart. I loved every second of the first two episodes of Better Call Saul. We are beginning the season with many strings left untied but I have complete faith in all questions being answered. If you loved Breaking bad for all the reasons I did including the cinematography, music, scenery, characters and most of all the story line, then you will love this. I apologize for going slightly off topic but in looking back at the breaking bad episode with the fly in the lab, some people found that they did not enjoy this episode, I on the other hand loved it. I appreciate the pure genius of the directing that goes behind every minute of the show. I understand and respect that people are entitled to their own opinion but after reading the negative reviews given here about ""Better Call Saul"" all I can say is that they don't get it, and that is OK. It is worth a watch because if you end up enjoying the show you wont just like it, you will love it. This is the next life changing show that will become something you look forward to for many years. I am truly excited for what's to come.",literal
"Plot holes galore The story is interesting. A very rich family employs a male nanny. He is seemingly wonderful with the kids and with everyone, but he's secret mission is to reek havoc on their lives.

The scenery is beautiful and the acting is generally OK, but there are exceptions, and major weaknesses in the story.

Then actor playing the 'hot villain' is neither masculine enough to be considered 'hot', nor does he come off very likeable. More like a 'know-it-all smug creep' that practically no one would want around their kids.

Then there's the issue with the family's best friends - when the husband in that family goes missing naturally everybody is worried about him, but it seems they very soon lose interest in that and stop asking about him. Hardly believeable! And we don't know if anyone finds out what had happened to him.

Then there's a point where the wife and kids are in greece and the husband can't reach them because the wife doesn't have her cellphone. Again - this makes no sense - the daughter is well into her teens and the family is wealthy - so she hasn't got a cellphone? And there's no phone in the house? And he could easily call the local maid...so this drama as if he can't reach them until he gets there from London is just nonsense.",literal
"ONE OF THE BEST ACTION FILM FROM CHINA The Shadow's Edge is a thrilling action-packed movie that showcases the enduring talents of Jackie Chan and Tony Leung Ka-fai. Even in their 70s, these legends deliver powerful performances reminiscent of Sylvester Stallone and his crew in The Expendables.

While Jackie Chan is a familiar icon to many, Tony Leung shines as a cold-blooded villain who thrives on challenges. The film's main highlight is the intense fight scene between Tony and Jackie-a stellar, heart-pounding moment that captivates from start to finish.

Kudos to the new generation of actors and actresses, particularly Ci Sha, whose compelling monologue and gripping action sequence with Tony Leung elevate the movie's tension to new heights. The fight scenes featuring Jackie against Lionel and Qiu Nan are also a treat, incorporating some of his signature moves from past films.

Overall, this stands out as a solid action film from Chinese directors, boasting strong writing and a coherent story. They would do well to prioritize quality over quantity, as too many movies suffer from weak narratives or poor scripting.",figurative
"Too much plot armor Lets face the facts, the ideia behind this movie was great and had everything to be a 10/10. To begging with, the characters had no development, they are dropped out of nothing. We had no idea who those people were, their life story and the reason they commited to the mission. In another topic, there was way too much plot armour, most of the characters would die if the movie was realistic. The violent nature of the dinosaurs was wasted, as only 4 of the 11 characters were killed. The death of more characters would have enhanced this nature and made the film more interesting. One last thing to point is the lack of violence. The violence that one would expect from homicidal dinosaurs is not present. The characters' constant escape makes the dinosaurs seem slow and stupid. The deaths of the less trained characters would be expected, such as Isabella, Xavier, Nina, Reuban and Martin. The deaths would also have to be more violent and brutal. On the brigth side, the plot itself was great and the visuals were stunning.",literal

Don't believe the hype - it's boring as hell. I fell asleep six different times.

This thing is so lazy and non-committal, it'll make you long for the days of movies like ""The Day After,"" ""Armageddon,"" and ""Outbreak,"" when Hollywood had to actually put some imagination and star power behind their product.

I blame myself for being fooled by the hype machine. When you see the Netflix logo you know you're about to waste your time and money. Trust what you know.",literal
"Lowdown: Authentic, Relevant, and Rooted in Tulsa Lowdown is one of the most relevant shows to come out in a long time. It is not a direct retelling of Tulsa history, but it draws loosely on stories connected to the Brady family and their ties to the Ku Klux Klan and the Tulsa Race Massacre. The series uses that backdrop as inspiration rather than strict history, and so far it has managed to capture a lot of subtle details that feel true to Tulsa.

What makes it stand out is the authenticity. From the look and feel of the city to the number of local extras involved, it shows a real care for getting Tulsa right. This is a refreshing change compared to shows like Tulsa King, where Taylor Sheridan not only got many things wrong about Tulsa but also chose not to film here at all.

Some critics have written it off as simply political, but that misses the point. This is not about pushing an agenda. It is a story that pulls from Tulsa's past while creating something new, and it is all the more powerful for it.

Even with only two episodes released, it is already clear that Lowdown has the potential to be essential viewing.",literal
"It won't replace the cartoon, but it's worth seeing! I wasn't expecting much from this movie. Although I admit I like Jim Carrey and the Grinch cartoon, I figured putting them together would be a disaster.

It wasn't. The movie is different enough from the cartoon that it's interesting to watch, and I wasn't constantly comparing the two. Anthony Hopkins is no Boris Karloff, but with the extended plot the movie doesn't rely on the narrator NEARLY as much as the cartoon did. (Not that Hopkins was really bad, it's just that Karloff was that much better.)",literal
"Lighthearted mystery dramedy Going on the introduction: the good place (which I watched) this is less of a comedy and more of a soapy show with some comedic situations, wrapped in a mystery set-up.

A necklace was stolen and Ted Dansons's character is hired by a private eye to infiltrate a senios residence.

While touching on dementia, we barely got to see any of it. What really is behind the doors of 'memory care'?

I work with people who suffer from different types of dementia and I don't feel this series was about dementia at all.

Yes, the late wife of our main protagonist died of Alzheimer's, and there was the woman who started to suffer from a form of dementia, but there was little from there.

It looked more like an all-in hotel for seniors.

The premise is fun. The series was fun. But in my opinion it's not comparable to The good place.

It's going to the finale to finally have Danson bond with his daughter and his handler to appreciate him and also the friend he made to get over the spying.

I had fun watching it, I don't mind if there wouldn't be a new season. Netflix has many other shows deserving of continuation.",literal
"Addictive but also anowing The show is addictive and great for binge watching. I would give it an eight if not for the annoying parts. Some small but important differences I believe could have added a lot more quality to the show. Stana Katic delivers a stunning performance and she is driver of the show.

This being said, I will necessarily have to go to the spoilers, so stop reading if you want to be spared.

The husband is an asshole even though he is not portrayed that way. His wife whom he clearly loved goes missing and after six years he has a new wife that clearly has been there for quite some years, because she treats her stepson like her son and the kid clearly sees her as her mom and even dismisses his dead mom (also weird because any child would still hang to the victim mom whom everyone assumes is dead - even dough body was never found). The husband reacts in a positive way and saves her once he learns she is alive. After that, I mean, he reencounters the wife he loved so much and whose grave he would visit with feelings attached. He is married to another (too soon in my opinion but that can happen), still has feelings for after all not dead wife, but leaves her to bear with the trauma by herself. Yes he struggles with the feeling, but keeps on going home to his new wife and, again, leaves his also wife (no divorce happened) who clearly needed his help the most to deal with all that happened to her by herself, feeling abandoned by his husband. He does help with the investigation, but man that is so not enough! And he is a crap detective. Should he have left his more current wife? Well, I believe he should have, if only to have space to figure out whom he loves the most at the moment, make his choice and also to make himself available to his first (and also current) wife who went through hell.

Oh, but she came out differently. Is that a shock?? Of course she has! And she is constantly being judged by that, left alone to deal with her demons (minus the FBI's psychologist), abandoned by her husband and her child whom is really rude to her (because his mum was tortured for 6 years?? This would never happen in real life).

In mids of all, she hangs on, is able to create a bond with her son. While the current 2nd wife becomes (understandably i must add on her behalf) more and more obnoxious.

And the idiot husband of both feels betrayed by 1st wife because she is unfairly being charged by the system whom has already failed her so much and can't face the fact of being again incarcerated because she has been for 6 years while under tortured. The husband only feels betrayed and goes on to becoming against his 1st and still current wife, to the point of physically abusing her when both are fighting to save their son.

And after all this? She is the one who apologises and says he is better off with current new wife. That is it for him. Get away free card. He doesn't even apologise for having been utterly stupid and unfair most of the time.

And they all become friends. What an idiot ending. And has a women, it makes me angry how easily the man gets off the hook.",literal
"Is the relationship between parents and three teens realistic? Where Ted Danson is involved in dialogue with others at the facility or with his investigation boss, or even with a very truthful scene with his daughter, I enjoyed the show immensely. However, I was shocked at the relationship between his daughter, her husband and the kids. It's unrealistic (paying for learning about a kid's day???) the kids are rude, the parents eat dinner alone, and every time I watch these scenes, I feel uncomfortable and think, ""Come on. Surely you can do better than this?"" Perhaps in Season two, the relationship between parents and three teen boys will come to a head and eventually (or suddenly) improve, In an otherwise completely enjoyable show, with good humour, poignancy and truth, I was disappointed. I hope I'm not disappointed next season, with a teen/parent turnaround.",literal
"Melodramatic Pap Magnificent Obsession is an overly melodramatic soap opera blessed with some good actors who cannot rise above the script. If you listen to this movie without watching the picture, it is easy to hear the horrible music, the overly dramatic phrasing, and the silly dialogue. Everything is just too earnest.

What really makes this film as loser though is the premise upon which the story is constructed--that everyone has a destiny. And that you cannot fulfill that destiny unless you help others without acknowledgement.

Helping others without extracting credit for it is a noble aim. Everyone should aspire to it. But by saying that you will get what you want via your destiny if you follow this noble path, it undercuts the message, by rewarding the giver. Also, the concept of destiny, as expressed in Christian terms in the film, is nothing more than mumbo jumbo. Too bad they didn't advocate giving for the sake of doing something nice for someone. Or solely because it is the right thing to do.

For those who think of Rock Hudson only in terms of his partnerships with Doris Day, a film like Magnificent Obsession might be an eye opener. But he played plenty of meatier roles with better scripts, e.g. Giant.",literal
"The perfect blend of comedy and horror Having not seen the original movie and only tidbits of the trailer, I didn't really know what to expect when walking into the cinema this evening. Someone described the movie as 'The Goonies' meets 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' - this turned out to be an extremely accurate description!

The opening scene seems to suggest that the movie will be very dark, yet these expectations are quickly dispersed as the horror is undercut by comedy. This happens repeatedly throughout the film: and it works. My friends and I (as well as the entire packed cinema) found ourselves gasping at scenes of sheer terror, then only moments later laughing hysterically at the banter between the main characters.

I would say that this is not a film for the faint of heart, yet I think even those individuals would find themselves enjoying 'It'. If not for the horror, then certainly for the comedy and camaraderie. It's as if this is a movie within a movie: a mix of a high-school-problems/coming-of-age movie and a horror. A brilliant two-for-one if you ask me!

Great acting from all of the cast as well as excellent writing make this movie a must watch!",literal
"Like A B-Movie Well, just got done watching this one last night, and I must say that I was greatly disappointed. Foreign films, like any other, are hit and miss  and this one was definitely a miss. The only truly redeeming quality was the cinematography and visuals, which were good, but nothing spectacular.

Ironically, the most disappointed aspect of Brotherhood of the Wolf (""BotW"") were the action scenes, which seem to be garnering praise from just about everyone on these review sites. Without question, the most important part of an action scene is the choreography, whether it be hand-to-hand combat or a car chase. The fights in BotW can be categorized as follows: (1) hand-to-hand conflicts between humans; and (2) weapon battles between humans and the beast.

With regards to the former type of action, this film is abhorrent. The action choreography is so lazy and unoriginal that I am truly perplexed why anyone would enjoy it to any significant degree. Turn on any B-flick or made-for-TV action movie and you'll see a comparable quality of action. Quite frankly, I could have pulled off most of the moves in this one: block a punch, kick the guy; block a punch, punch a guy; etc. Post-production need only add some slow-mo and sound effects, and I'd be the next French superstar. Anyone who considers the hand-to-hand choreography in BotW to be great should seriously consider upgrading their movie standards to include some of the films from East Asia (notably Fist of Legend, Tom Yum Goong, Sha Po Lang, So Close, and Azumi). Basically, BotW doesn't hold a candle to any of those films in terms of hand-to-hand combat choreography. In fact, BotW is barely average. The frequent references to the ""great action"" in this film is probably due to nothing more than the characters looking cool and stylish, and is not an accurate description of the action itself.

With regards to the latter type of action (between humans and the beast), the choreography is just okay. At one point, the characters had the beast trapped, but acted too slowly to kill it. Also, the beast itself did nothing noteworthy. You'd figure that such a killing machine would have some awesome attacks  but you would be very, very wrong.

With regards to acting, the lead character comes off as a pompous pretty boy who is so full of himself that he's almost impossible to like. The Indian was better, but lacked any character development whatsoever. The townspeople are really stupid in this one. Like morons, they keep killing dozens of regular wolves when there is no way in hell a wolf could be behind the murders. The dialogue is uninteresting and pointless to the main storyline.

Finally, the true villain of the film exposes the storyline as nothing more than an excessively long and mediocre propaganda piece for philosophical naturalism that lacks any notable entertainment value.",figurative
"Used to be 10 stars but has gone WAY down hill after season 13 This show used to be in my top 5 must not miss shows every week until season 14. I honestly don't know what they were thinking when they forced Bishop & Kasie on us. Those 2 have ruined the show for me. I can tolerate the other 2 newbies, Torres & Sloane, to a point, but they too aren't the best fit either. It was great to bring back Ziva this season as an attempt to keep us interested, but it's a little too late because the damage has already been done the last few seasons. I can no longer watch without cringing every time Bishop & Kasie are on the screen because they just don't belong on this show. So many other loyal fans have said the same things & it amazes me they haven't replaced these horrible characters yet, but maybe the plan is to end the show, so they figure why bother writing in better characters. Anyway, I just want to say how much I truly enjoyed every season up to 13. I put up with most of season 14 only because I love Jennifer Esposito & wanted to see where that was going, but the minute they forced that out of nowhere relationship Bishop had onto us & then had her go all crazy & murder that guy it made me sick to my stomach to watch after that. I actually forced myself to keep watching just because I kept thinking things would change & that maybe Bishop would get fired for what she did or get demoted, since that's what it seemed was going to happen, except nothing happened. I guess the writers just gave up trying after that. I finally stopped watching it weekly after Kasie joined the team, though because she's the absolute worst fit of any character that's ever been on the show & I just couldn't stomach watching it after that. Last month I went back to try & catch up before this new season started by trying to skip through the parts when she came on & parts where it was just Bishop, too, but it's just not worth the trouble, so I am officially done watching for good now. It's such a shame how they made it so many seasons picking good characters that fit well with each other & with Gibbs, but then they just stopped trying after season 13. Thanks for 13 great seasons at least.",literal
"I hoped that it would be better I came into this movie expecting the type of entertaining lowish budget actions movies that have come out in the last decade. Visceral and hard-hitting...and came away disappointed.

There's tons of action, and the cinematography and acting is competent...but far too many of the action scenes are just too unrealistic. The guy blocks a heavy machine gun's bullets with a mining pan that he holds in his hands like it's Captain America's shield...I actually went back thinking that he picked up a tank hatch or something...but no a thin piece of steel is stopping bullets. Far too many of the action scenes rely on these outlandish premises. It's not that Sisu is a skilled and determined soldier seeking bloody revenge...he's a freakin' super hero.

It does feel like those sequences were done to look impressive, without actual thought to making them believable. Which undermines the entire film, and the premise that he's just gutting it through. This movie would have been so much better if they grounded it a lot more. Why not have him come up for a breath instead of literally sucking the air out of gaping neck wound? Why not have him dive for cover instead of tanking HMG rounds? There's just so many baffling decisions that take away from the movie that the good scenes (and there are several) really made me wonder why there couldn't have been more of those type of sequences instead.

Most action movies are not realistic...but the best avoid disrupting the suspension of disbelief. In this case the movie more-or-less jumps the shark from the first major action sequence, and never really gets back in the groove.

An interesting, yet wasted premise...I don't regret watching it, it was fairly entertaining, but I'll probably never watch it again.",literal
"Spellbinding, Unique Show which deserves to be watched in it's own right!!!! I admit to being confused as to why SOOOO many folk are talking about Peaky Blinders this is The House of Guiness, it is not Peaky Blinders, just because it is a period drama. Why are you not saying it is not like Rogue Heroes, did you all compare Rogue Heroes to Peaky Blinders. There is an essence running through the shows of Steven Knight that is recognisable, the history, the amazing image, the rythm of the show where the incredible use of music makes you ride through it as if you are riding a wave. But that is it, this is a completely different story, time, place and characters to his other shows and if it was a repeat of Peaky Blinders you would all be shouting how boring and lazy Knight is for repeating his hit show within a different story and setting.

Now lets get away from his previous work and look at this FANTASTIC show in it's own right because it absolutely deserves it. I loved it, my Mam loved it and we are desperately waiting for Season2. We watched it over 2 nights and we were wired with energy each night after watching it made settling to go to sleep rather difficult and had to watch TV/read to calm down our brains from the excietment. Everything in this show is top notch, from the whole look of it, costumes, script (which had some incredibly funny lines in it) and the acting. James Norton had a stance and command to him that you could so easily spot him in a crowd just by the way he was standing. This alone gave us so much information about him and his character without much dialogue in the first few minutes of episode1 and lets agree that this episode started with a bang! The funeral scenes were so impactful and gave so much information in a short space of time about this family. This show moved, there was no 'gazing out the window' moments as my Mam calls them, when people seem to slow EVERYTHING down SOOO much to try to give impact or mood, no whispering or boring moments. The show went on waves and the music represented the rythm& energy of the scene and it made you go on a fantastic ride along with the characters. Here I will compare, but to Rogue Heroes not Peaky Blinders, they too have the music take you along with them and demonstrate the energy of the story, something I have never seen anybody else other than Knight use in this way. I know some don't like modern music in a period drama but they are getting a feeling that modern us can relate to, rap, hip hop, contemporary music and comparing it to how these folk were feeling back in the day, showing how we are not so different to them and they were not quite so stuck up and stiff as most of us imagine the rich to have been. I liked the debauchery and the swearing and the real people with their father looming over and remaining in control even year and more after his death. I didn't always like the characters but just as I was starting to get irritated by their entitlement a more human side of them appears and I start to like them again. I could go on more, a lot more about the love of this show but I will spare you all that. I do want to beg those of you who have not watched it yet to FORGET what Knight has done in the past, he is not remaking past shows but coming up with new excieting and original NEW shows to keep us engaged and excieted. If you enjoyed Peaky Blinders so much that you want to see it again then go and rewatch the show again from the beginning and let The House of Guinness stand alone as an incredible piece of work in it's own right!!!",literal
"I'm from Mentor Ohio and it's about time! I'm from Mentir Ohio, the home of Garfield. His house a museum and many roads are named after him. A city park is named for him as well as schools. I heard my whole life about him yet never has there been any real story written about him.

It's about time.

The cast is frigging outstanding! The acting superb! They instill a bit of humor in things nicely. The writing and directing superb as well.

At minimum it's worth watching for its historical value.. at best it's a great saga and recollection of a story told too late for everyone. This was long overdue! An assassinated president barely gets a blurb of notice.

I'm glad I came from a place who did honor him as president and mourned his death. Many have never given him a thought!",literal
"Unforgettable Ride! In the shadow of America's opulent excess, Death by Lightning strikes like a bolt from the blue, transforming the forgotten tragedy of James Garfield's assassination into a pulse-pounding saga of ambition, betrayal, and fleeting glory. David Franzoni's script crackles with authenticity, blending meticulous historical detail with taut, modern suspense-think The Assassination of Jesse James meets Succession's cutthroat boardrooms, but set against the gaslit grandeur of 1881 Washington. Matthew Macfadyen is magnetic as the scheming Charles Guiteau, his oily charm masking a descent into delusion that's equal parts chilling and heartbreaking. Opposite him, Michael Shannon's Garfield simmers with quiet fire, a reformer whose idealism clashes against the era's corrupt undercurrents in scenes that linger like thunder. The ensemble shines too-Gillian Jacobs brings fierce wit to Lucretia Garfield, while the production design (those lavish costumes! Those shadowy saloons!) immerses you utterly. At just eight episodes, it never drags, building to a finale that's as devastating as it is inevitable. If you crave smart, stylish history that hits harder than a headline, this is your must-watch. Lightning indeed-fast, fierce, unforgettable.",figurative
"For Dimwits Only Excellent film for those completely ignorant in U. S. military readiness and response. Given Kathryn's previous work on ""The Hurt Locker"", this is unsurprising. The unrealistic emotionalism of the primary (military) characters approaches haminess to a degree not seen since Shatner fought an alien in 1966. Soldiers and Airmen in these roles, and in their leadership chain, would remain on task with little to no emotion through the entire process. ADDITIONALLY, the U. S. has a multi-tiered ABM response in place on both water and on land, where multiple ""kill"" vehicles would be launched in response to such a threat. Purporting a singular ABM launch as the only response is preposterous. 4/10.",literal
"Why call it Watson? If you're watching this thinking you're getting anything even remotely to do Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson, don't waste your time.

This is a basic formulaic med/md show. If you like that sort of thing, this may be for you. I don't care for them, but my partner usually does, but not this one.

Whose dumb idea was it to throw the Holmes/Watson angle in there? Did they need filler material to make it 40 minute episodes. There is such an utter disconnect between the two concepts. They could have called it Doctor Johnson and His Team Interesting Medical People.

I could tell it was not what it was billed about 20 minutes in and will not watch another episode.",literal
"a 9.2....eh...come again? I had never heard of this show until a couple of weeks ago when someone started raving about it at a party. Soon others joined him in the glorification of the, what soon got to be called, 'show of the century'. I must say, I was intrigued.

I was even more intrigued by the big fat 9.2 this show gets here on IMDb. I mean, that was a first for me.

I found the complete first season on Usenet and started to watch anxiously as soon as the first episodes hit my harddrive.

I watched....and watched some more. Suddenly I woke up from the incredible loud hiss of my headphones which tend to make this sound after being inactive for too long to warn its owner its batteries are being sucked dry. I had fallen asleep like a baby. Talk about firsts.

I must have been tired I thought to myself so the next day I watched another episode and another one the day after that, etc etc. I got to about 5 of them.

Is it just me? (yes, apparently) or is there really nothing happening in this series which is even slightly compelling? It must be just me, all I see is just another episode of As the World Turns only this time using every goddamn mafia-cliché in the book.

The characters are Só cliché that it's simply impossible to find any of them likable (or even slightly interesting) and because of the whole mob-setting, I'm expecting a suspenseful watch only to be disappointed by a soap-with-the-f-word which to my surprise is dragged out over 7 seasons???!!

For a completely depleted theme, which to me the mafia had become after regretfully seeing 'Analyse This', to resurrect in a series where humor is lacking, originality is exiled and suspense has been replaced by Golden Girls caliber drama to be voted a 9.2 is truly beyond me.

Was the voting only open to teenagers who never saw the classics?",literal
"Not great. One or two kind of funny moments but not amazing, but hey, humour is subjective. But damn the acting is bad. Every sentence is either shouted or witty for no reason, like those new movies made for low attention span tiktok kids. I know the scenario isn't realistic but characters reactions, etc should try to be at least, and they are definetly not. Even Bruce Almighty had way more credible reactions in similar situations.

I guess it's a modern movie for modern US audience, sad. Representative of a trend of low quality movies made by people disconnected from reality enough time to forget how people actually speak and react irl.",literal
"Funny, Action Packed, Outstanding Storyline---perfect anime for me I was a bit skeptical watching at first but after seeing the phenomenal reviews in social media and after finally caving in, it honestly blew me away. One Punch Man is a show that forces me to revert to the age old question, ""Why didn't I find out about this sooner?"" The things that stood out the most were the comedic content, rich story line with fantastic characters, and artistic animation (much like BLEACH) which truly does make this a unique new show any anime lover is guaranteed to enjoy. If there is one down side I have for this show is that its only 24 minutes....I kept ending the show wanting more, both a good and bad thing.",literal
"Not the worst I did not feel the emotional journey of the characters in the movie very well. I think it didn't translate well from book to film. Especially the on-screen chemistry between Morgan and Jonah was lacking as well as the actors acting skills. I thought Mckenna Grace did an incredible job and definitely outperformed her older co-stars.

All in all i think it was a very mid movie.",figurative
"Exceeded Expectations. I loved this film. I expected a Liam Neeson action film and I got that, but there was much more here. This is a character driven movie as much as an action film. I kept wanting to get popcorn but was riveted the whole time and didn't want to miss a thing. I was also quite moved by Liam's characters back story and how it impacted his decision to help the young boy to safety. Their scenes together were quite touching. The ending also surprised me as it gave a few seconds of humanity to someone whom I would never suspect deserved it. Unfortunately we can all become victims of situations that are beyond our control. A great film is one that can make you feel a variety of human emotions, and this Marksman hit all the right marks.",literal
"It's a mildly entertaining binge. The teen parts of the series are the better ones. The youngest cast members outshine the adults. I don't want to throw shade, but the lead is super weak, which is a shame.

Theres a decent amount of intrigue.

I feel like every time the show actually got close to saying something, it backed off. The most poignant part was a certain someone's death, you'll know it when you see it.",literal
It was such a good wonderful movie absolutely loved it Love it. Really made me cry. It made me think of my cousin that is no longer here we watched the first one when we were kids. I'm 36 now miss her so much such a great movie that brought tears to my eyes and a lot of memories back. 10 out of 10. Hope they will consider making another one. I hope everyone goes out and watches this movie.,literal
"They should have let the original stay retired. I've been watching L&O since the 1990s. I watched almost every iteration. SVU. Organized Crime. The original. Criminal Intent. Even LA for its single season. I've loved most of the detectives. The ADAs are typically solid. But Ada Price has been dreadful, his co-counsel isn't much better, and the current DA is very rigid and rarely shows empathy. But Price, in the end, is either incompetent or spineless. I've nearly screamed at the TV for his excessive failures to ask critical questions or object effectively. This might be my final season watching if he's still the ADA at season's end.",literal
"This show was a missed GEM!!! No joke. I missed it when it was on regular TV (GLAD! So I didn't have to deal with commercials haha) but can't believe I'd never heard even of it! It's up there good: like as good as freakin Breaking Bad, Sons of Anarchy, GOT, Walking Dead, The Man in The HIGH Castle, Lost. It's 100% suck you in captivating. Not to be compared to any of those shows, just reminding of the excitement and inability to wait to find out! What's happening?! I need to know!

Don't snooze on this one. Don't put it on for background noise/something to sleep to either: you've gotta watch and be involved. Believe me! You'll be fulfilled once you have.

It's really.",figurative
"Run for your life, criminal! Vintage 80's, Arnie doing what he does best; undoubtedly now a cult classic, ""The Running Man"" hits you with nostalgia and awe..., somewhat lame and crude compared to today's standards, particularly with the visuals and special effects, it is a film very much etched in the 80's and a product of its time.

Full of wall to wall action, fights and crude violence, the film doesn't give you a moment to breathe, it picks up the pace immediately and doesn't stop until the credits roll, and that is exactly how an action film should be!

""The Running Man"" doesn't tell an intellectual and thought provoking story, not at all, this is an action flick designed for adrenaline junkies from a certain age, and it truly delivers what it promises.

A cool film that hasn't particularly aged well, but in my opinion the fact that it hasn't aged too well simply adds to its charm and appeal.",literal
"Loved this Not sure why I just got such bad reviews. It was hilarious and action packed super cute and even slightly emotional. I recommend this movie a chance. I don't know what people were expecting, it's clearly not meant to be some award-winning Oscar contender. It was just fun and entertaining. It did its intended job.",literal
Good Clean Lighthearted Fun A great cast. Lighthearted and funny. Just what we all need...during the horrible times we all have faced in the last year and a half. Nothing dark to drag you down here.,literal
"It is what it is... Yes, it's slightly silly, very predictable, and somewhat mediocre, but it is what it is... a samurai-era Squid Game.

If you can imagine Shogun with more action scenes, this most certainly isn't it. There's no intricate plot, none of the style of the aforementioned work in both script and casting. And it consists of everything you've probably seen before.

If, however, you prefer the simpler things in life-that is, sword fights and gore, with little else to think about-then I'm sure you'll be entertained, until that novelty wears off.",literal
ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE This is the BEST TV show I've ever watched. The CGI IS TOP NOTCH. WITH MASTERFUL DIRECTION AND TWISTS AND TURNS. BEST CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT WHICH IS A CHERRY ON TOP. Even though the ending is bit disappointing it still worth a watch. Even though you aren't in this genre of kings and dragons I bet you will not regret this at any cost .,figurative
"Boring 10% crime, 90% family drama. I was already bored after 20 minutes but kept watching in hopes it would get better. Unfortunately It didn't. Most of the characters were unlikable and some were even irritating and difficult to watch. I expected more from HBO. Looks like all the good series are now on Apple.",literal
"So much talent wasted One of the things you can depend on in the world of television is that, if a particular show succeeds, there will be multiple attempts to copy it in the hope that it's the formula that makes it a success. Unfortunately, formulas don't work by themselves, they need good writing. The mockumentary formula that made The Office, Parks & Recreation, and Abbott Elementary succeed falls flat on its face here thanks to abysmal writing.

When I first saw the cast list, I was looking forward to this show being released. But then I watched a trailer and was left shaking my head.

I love many of the actors in St. Denis Medical, but I can't believe they signed up for this after seeing any of the scripts. Or maybe they didn't read any and it was blind trust on their part. At any rate, they have no chance of saving this mess thanks to the clunky writing and ham-fisted directing. The fact that some viewers like this disaster is actually scary.",figurative
"Terrible Waste of time and money. Walked out after an hour of this mess. Over the top profanity, characters that were totally unlikable, and not much of a plot that I could see. I think the movie studios do not know how to make a good movie anymore. I really couldn't decide who the actual bad characters were in this. I didn't like any of them. Not sure why so many are giving this mess 9s and 10s. I would give it a negative 10 if I could. This is only the second movie in my life that I have walked out of and I wish I would have left sooner.",literal
"Best cop show on TV This is absolutely the best cop show on TV. There's less time in the court room and more with the detectives, which I enjoy. I think there needs to be more time with the detectives off the job. My favorite detective is Olivia Benson, the child of a rape who is played by Mariska Hargitay.Olivia is one of those detectives who would be really awesome if you knew her well, but you wouldn't want to get on her bad side. She is also very stubborn. She and Elliot Stabler (a family man played by Christopher Meloni) make a great team. Christopher and Mariska are great actors.  I often forget that these are actors, not real people. I think Olivia should have a boyfriend. It might help her stop being so stubborn. This is just the best cop show ever to be on TV and I hope it stays on for a long time.",literal
"Hot mess The set design is incredible.

But the series sinks, with every episode.

I have finished whatever the latest episode is, and I am just chugging through it. Such a waste.

I am curious about the ratings. I am hearing NOTHING about this. Even Apple+ has pushed it down the ladder, in terms of exposure.

Rather than a Kristen Wiig skit, I would have enjoyed this, more in the vein of ""Big Little Lies,"" or something similar.

The slapstick is tiresome.

Great to see Carol Burnett. However, it feels like stunt casting.

I will watch it till the end, but I will be surprised if it is cleared for a second season.",figurative
"A good morality tale. This is NOT a tense thriller. This is a sobering story about doing what's right, even though it costs you everything-with a very poignant ending.",literal
"Can we stop rating every new movie a 7? I wanted to like it, obviously, but I just have to call it what it is, bad. The film immediately gave the vibes of rushed, and lazy. It was like a half baked thought experiment with the script being very simple, the acting subpar, and the delivery of the lines in the same monotone style the entire film. It felt so long but it was only an hour 30.

It's yet another film that has this idea of feelings about social and economic issues but has no idea how to convey it so it just forces it out with little to no context.

And yet again, Seth rogen is playing the exact same character that he has in every other movie he's done.

2/10, not good.",literal
"Not a comedy! The trailer made it look like a comedy. AMC Theatres list it as a comedy. I went in expecting a dark comedy, but, instead, I got a very tense, frustrating, and sometimes irritating film. I did not enjoy the experience, and that might have been the point of the movie. Rose Byrne was fantastic. However, I cannot rate this movie highly because it did not meet the expectations set by how it was marketed.",literal
"Brilliant When this show is on it's game, it is brilliant, amazing television. So well-cast, well-written and well directed, it shows what cable TV can achieve. Now, like any creative vehicle, it too can fall short. There are messy, uneven episodes. The season ender this year was rather all over the place and unsatisfying, but, overall, great television. Gandolfini deserves all the praise coming his way. (His monolouge as a hitman describing his first ""hit"" in True Romance is a great piece of work). Bravo!!",literal
"Giggling With Jim Carrey's 'Grinch'. Howard's 'How the Grinch Stole Christmas' is a delightful family flick that both adults and children can enjoy (mostly with each other). It is basically an adaptation of the famous children's books and what the audience gets is a pleasant Christmas treat. Price's screenplay is brilliant as he cleverly manages to include some adult humour.

The world of Whoville is beautifully constructed and created, full of colour, life, energy and spirit. The vivacious characters are full of positive energy and while it is over the top, it is all done within the context and none of it appears out of place. The CGI team and makeup crew deserve full credit for making the characters and settings so lifelike, bringing out a lot of detail and appearing authentic. The set designs are stunning and the cinematography is just as energetic as the characters.

Child actress Taylor Momsen is absolutely. The cute dog also turns in a fine performance. Jeffrey Tambor, a very sexy Christine Baranski, Bill Irwin and Molly Shannon are first rate. However, what would 'How the Grinch Stole Christmas' be without Jim Carrey? Carrey is simply fantastic as he immerses himself entirely into the character. It's a role that has Jim Carrey written all over it. The actor has immortalized the Grinch on screen.

The movie itself is not an exact 100% adaptation of the book as there are a few changes. The romance between the Grinch and Martha May could have been better developed. Other than the actors mentioned above, the rest of the cast hardly have anything to do than make fleeting appearances. Yet, 'How the Grinch Stole Christmas' is a charming little Christmas family film that is dazzling to look at and hugely enjoyable with the whole family.",literal
"People really find it funny? This is horrible. I knew it from the first scene, this will be another cringe show, where the source of ""humour"" is that all the characters are obnoxious jerks, and they get into very embarrassing situations. The side characters are bland, oh look, she is fat, hahahaha, and the other one is old, hahahahaha, and they're miserable, oh my god so funny!

It is not. I will never understand why so many people like this kind of ""humour"".",literal
Random mess Not a good movie. It was hard to stay awake through this one. Very little character development and even less of a plot to keep you engaged. The characters a barely likable and the random flashes of horror just don't make sense. Not worth the price of a ticket. Recommend you wait to watch this one free on tubi in a couple of months.,literal
"Low-key uncomfortable Are you trying to convert me? Becuase Nobody Wants This. You create this perfect, tender, understanding, and smooth Jewish rabbi and also great chemistry with a loved-by-all actress. Of course, people will love it. However, it is very strategic with delicately inserted Judaism philosophy, tradition, and ceremony. Then, it's just one episode of a female protagonist staying true to who she is at the end. 'Nobody Wants This' pretends to talk about inter-religious and inter-ethnic relationships, but it is really talking about Judaism. Hollywood.... doing it again, and people are obsessed with it.. again.",literal
"Not John Hughes' best, but not bad, in fact it is quite entertaining I do not think Weird Science is John Hughes' best film, but it is a decent enough film that did entertain me. It is too short however, and the humour occasionally is rather crass. However, I loved the concept, it was original and I think it worked rather well. The film looks good too, the scenery and cinematography are typical Hughes which is a good thing in itself, while the soundtrack is cool. While the humour is crass, there are some funny moments and some inspired wit in the script, while the pacing and direction are fine. The acting is good enough as well. Anthony Michael Hall Ilan Mitchell-Smith are likable leads, while Bill Paxton gives the best performance and Kelly LeBrock is smouldering. Also look out for Robert Downey Jnr in this. Overall, not bad, not amazing but it entertains. 7/10 Bethany Cox",figurative
"I love love love this show! OK. I read some of the lesser reviews but I totally disagree. I love this show and after 1 episode I was hooked! And now, seven episodes in, I'm addicted! I know that there are flaws (most medical, trauma, firefighter, cops shows have them), but I love the characters and the way the cast is really coming together. I cannot wait to see what happens next! The plot could be written in so many different ways and I can see the possibilities for this show to run for a long time. 

The character development is really good. I love Severide and Casey and am so hoping that NBC is reading these reviews and they renew the show for another year (unlike Trauma). The ratings may not be what they want at this very moment, but please give us of those that love it a chance to continue to do so! It takes a while for word of mouth to spread about a great show, but I'm doing my part to make sure that others tune in. Please keep in mind folks that this is not a reality show. It is for drama entertainment purposes and its wonderful.",literal
"The story is far fetched, but the movie is magnificent indeed. In the '50s the films of Douglas Sirk were highly appreciated by women and not held in very high esteem by critics (they regarded his films as weepies).

Today it is the other way around. Today critics see the subtle criticism on the hypocrisy of the 50's consumer society through the surface of the amazing technicolor images. This is especially evident in a film like ""All that heaven allows"" (1955).

""Magnificent obsession"" was made one year earlier, with the same lead actors (Rock Hudson and Jane Wyman). More important is that this film is not so much on the level of society as a whole but much more on the individual level. A conceited millionaire who becomes righteous through his love for a blind woman.

This film has relations with ""The game"" (1997, David Fincher, spoiled millionaire) and ""City lights"" (1931, Charlie Chaplin, blind girl). From the book (1929, Lloyd C. Douglas) it also has an unmistakable christian undertone. Its theme is derived from the gospel of St Matthew 6:1-4. Good deeds have te be performed in silence.",literal
"Great show. Great lead. This one of the best series to come along in years! Justin Hartley is perfect as the lead character in this well developed series. The supporting cast is also well developed, colorful, and interesting. The script writers for the most part have used the same character in several episodes that ties the whole series together rather than each episode being like a separate story. There is continuity and a sense of community working together. They could become a bit more involved in the storyline like Tracker's female lawyer friend. Over all it is relatively mild as far as messiness and potential gore of a mystery/thriller could be.

It is well written with a variety of situations that keep it from being a cookie cutter series.",literal
"Was not expecting this at all So I thought this was going to be God awful like most Netflix adaptations, but I found myself laughing and appreciating the camerawork, the clothes, the colors, the acting etc. The way everything is colorful and vibrant while Wednesday is just colorless and unemotional makes Wednesday stick out so much from being so out of place. You almost can feel how much she dislikes almost everything. She's smart, witty, and honestly kind of scary. Catherine Zeta Jones made me a believer in her from her performance. From start to finish this was a easy and fun watch. It almost flew by too fast and now I want more.",literal
"A BLAST! Wowwww! It was superbbbbbb! The cast, the plot! I'm sure there are a lot of great things in store for us! PLEASEEEEEEEEE NEXT SEASON! We wanted more! We all love this one!

I loved how the interplay of emotions in the whole series, the character development, and how each characters were introduced! Definitely none wasted! The writer is genius! The producer is the main protagonist himself! And Ryusei! Didn't expect him to do a cameo. Huhu.",literal
"Give it a chance And wait for the Complete show release before rating it! So I need to understand why the low rating?! And also by a lot of people, I don't understand why actually? I saw a lot of early screen reviews on the first 2 episodes, and they all amazed by the scale of the production and they called it like shogun meets squid game, which both were amazing show, so my question is what to not like here? Overall I really hope this show don't gets any review bombed.",literal

"Why so much hate on Claire Danes? I thought this limited series was very well done. Good cinematography and the plot kept held my interest. I'm a huge fan of Matthew Rhys, I thought he was superb in The Americans. I can see how people could think the Claire Danes characters always seem overly emotional and on the verge of a breakdown, like in Homeland, but those are the characters she's portraying, and not for nothing, she does it extremely well. Absolutely worth a watch. Judge for yourself, don't listen to the haters.",literal
"Whats shameless I watch this show over and over and love it, but have to wonder about some of the lines given to the youngsters. Years ago, children in shows were protected by their parents or guardians from having to do or say anything that was inappropriate for a minor. I guess like everything else today nobody cares and parents and guardians think nothing of it as long as money is to be made. In a scene with Carl playing a video game ""Debbie yells ""Eat my ass""; I found that disturbing, because of her age. Anyone else saying it would have been meaningless and not even noticed. I will not be surprised to see this type of show on regular TV in a few years, and the F--K word as a norm in any childs daily language. I remember my brother being suspended from school for using the word damn. Yes, that was a long time ago.",literal
Not a bad romance film Most of the reviews do not like this film but I surprisingly liked it considering I don't really like romance films in general. Cast was great and the story did have me a little intrigued. Not the best movie I've seen but not the worst so I can't complain. The characters were alright and they kept me interested enough.,literal
"One of the best! The Office is definitely one of the best sitcoms out there. How many times have I watched it! And yet I still always laugh and find new jokes I missed before. I still get upset when it is over and already wonder when will I start again.

The humor is wonderful. The characters are a great creation. All of them! They all bring something special to the show. Of course Michael Scott is a special one. And when it comes to Dwight Shrute I think he is one of the best in sitcom history. We also get some romance with Pam and Jim or Dwight and Angela.

The actors are great at their performing and on time humor. When we start the characters don't seem to have so much depth. But with time we start seeing how sweet Michael and Dwight are. All the little moments when we see Michael be in pain make us love him more and more. He is a guy who wants not only to be loved but to love. This is how he treats his office as his best friends or children.

And the great thing is that the show is on high level until it's very end. Even after Michael Scott leaves. Many say that it went down after, but even if it did it wasn't that far down. It still brought us a lot and I am glad they made those seasons. I liked all characters, except for Nellie and that was only for the short period of time when she was a manager. Now that was a disaster idea but they luckily saved it within a few episodes. And the end... The last episodes of the show are so emotional! They really made a great and successful effort to give the amazing show the ending it deserves. And I wish it was still going on...",literal
"Masterpiece ""Better Call Saul is one of the most outstanding TV series of recent years. This prequel to ""Breaking Bad"" follows the adventures of neighbourhood lawyer Jimmy McGill (played amazingly by Bob Odenkirk) as he transforms into the famous character of Saul Goodman.

What makes Better Call Saul so exceptional is its ability to tell a complex and exciting story without relying on constant drama or gratuitous shock. Instead, the series focuses on creating complex characters and the evolution of their relationships, and each episode is a little narrative gem.

In addition, the production of the series is impressive, with stunning set designs and photography, as well as an impeccably selected soundtrack. Each episode is a visual and technical masterpiece in its own right.

Overall, Better Call Saul is a series not to be missed. It's smart, funny and exciting, and it's full of interesting characters and plots.",figurative
"Wig and the casting were perfection Palm Royale captures the essence of the late 60s, with every element from cinematography to the soundtrack hitting just the right notes. The plot is engaging, offering a fun twist on dark comedy without diving too deep into heavy or intense plot twists/ so an easy to watch series if you don't want too much intensity. .

Kristen Wiig's playing Maxine is definitely the highlight. She embodies her character with a blend of vulnerability, gullible, hopeless romantic who everyone wants to tear to shreds. The character has this admirable bulletproof resilience that's captivating to watch. It's like Maxine is in a constant boxing match, taking hit after hit.

Ricky Martin delivers a surprisingly charming performance. His character has this smooth, effortless way of gliding through scenes that makes him a delight to watch.

The ensemble cast brings their characters to life with distinct, memorable qualities. Their on-screen chemistry adds a layer of authenticity and enjoyment to the series.

The one exception in casting/capability is, Mitsy, played by Kiera gerber (Cindy Crawford daughter). She justdidn't quite hit the mark for me. Her performance felt a bit wooden, and she struggled to match the depth and nuance of Wiig's experience, appearing slightly out of her element in this role. I get it / first big break. But I don't think this was the right fit for her.

Allison Janney, as Evelyn, is outstanding. She brings strength and presence to her role, earning every bit of applause for her performance.

""Palm Royale is a truly fun to watch, mixing great acting with a story that's entertaining and randomly inspiring.

Maxine's unyielding spirit, in particular, is a powerful draw, making the series a standout. It's almost a thing of the past,,, big risk, big reward.

It's a perfect mix of 60s flair and timeless themes, definitely worth your rime.",figurative
"Quite an Engrossing Series It's off to a roaring season 1. You wanted it not to end but it did in an explosive way. This is the way that movies in this genre should be made.

It was such an enjoyable movie experience, so life-like because what's in the movie could happen in real life. What made it more interesting is it's told in the context of events that we're familiar with in recent years such as Brexit, the festering war in Ukraine, the assassination of bin Laden.

The cast is splendid. But, like any other political drama worth its salt, there are actors and there are actors. Keri Russell, who's also executive producer, is amazing here. There's never a dull moment with her. She portrays an intelligent, feisty and pragmatic diplomat. Her screen presence is scintillating. The fact that she's now older with lines on her once pretty face makes her so much more credible in her role.

The other actor that strikes me is Ali Ahn. She's great here, too. I like how she handles her scenes with Ato Essandoh.

Perhaps, like many others like me, I can't wait for season 2 to roll. As Rufus Sewell's character intones: diplomacy doesn't work until it does. Right on.",literal
"Slow - terrible storyline - weird dinos This movie was so disappointing and honestly boring. It was rather slow with an all over the place, boring storyline. This was by far the worst of the Jurassic movies. I found myself looking at my watch several times wondering, how much longer. The new characters just didn't hit. They need to get back to the original island with the original Dino's. The other movies had way more Dino action and action in general. The attempts at comedy were so cheesy and fell flat. My kids were excited to see the next Jurassic movie and left with an 'ehh, it was fine' response. I would save your money on this one!",literal
"""If we chose poorly.. we apologize"" The leading character is suddenly dealing with an extreme case of change akin to an apocalypse. Resisting or adapting.. and whatever else comes from it, makes for an exciting new and creative show!

So far, with two episodes released, it is a great time to write a review filled with expectations and hopes.. and no spoilers!

The topic of ""CC"" (Collective Consciousness) is a favorite of mine.. so, it is my hope that this VERY high-concept show has decided to leave the interesting exploration of such ideas out of the introductory episodes. While intriguing and inviting with a great foundation for worldbuilding, it hasn't had time to offer anything else.

It is my hope that it does not just go into a ""romantic"" or individual-centric direction.. but expands and surprise with unexplored ideas and unexpected developments, and hopefully, weighty consequences. Or that she doesn't take too much time learning the rules of this new ""game"" and it gets interesting quickly!

The last thing I want for it, would be for it to be forgettable.. and to not be able to recommend it once it is done.",figurative
"Fun way to continue the saga Definitely worth watching. Maybe it wasn't just like the previous parts, but hey! The second part came out 10 years ago. Of course it will be completely different.

To the point I don't think it was perfect and exactly as I imagined it would be. Some of the drawbacks: the unnecessary tears... if you know you know, I won't spoil. It was so out of... everything.

The cast was obviously amazing. I loved all 5 of horsemans altogether - definitely refreshing. Amazing to see so many women and I just adored the little feminist comment.

What in my opinion went wrong is that at some point there were 7 people on the stage. And maybe that's a little bit too much? But then there are movies like Ocean's 13 and each one of those 13 people play very important role so maybe 7 is not as bad?

I feel they really tried to create a ""viral scene"" Previous shows got them really fast. For the first part it was Atlas changing clothes on the way to the stage and second it the famous ""flying card scene"" (still unbeaten). And here.. well maybe there is still some time to find out? Though a lot of scenes were good There were just too many of them?

The movie went veery fast and the plot was changing with a light speed. Sometimes it was good and sometimes I was wandering why are they doing that.

To sum up yes, there were some drawbacks but not as many to lower my rating. Maybe not all but there were so many good scenes that will live rent free in my mind. For sure I will rewatch that movie.

And for all of the bad reviews saying the previous parts were better it funny because as for right now the rating on IMDB is pretty similar...",literal
"An okay movie, but defineately not one of Rock's best. Although this was a fairly entertaining movie, it just didn't seem ""to do anything for me."" Usually, after witnessing the ""magnificent"" Rock Hudson on film, I'm left feeling ""all warm and tingly,"" (smiles) inside.  He gave an acceptable performance in ""MO"", but it certainly wasn't one of his best. With some shame, I have to admit that if it had not been for the mere fact that Rock Hudson WAS in this film, I wouldn't have stopped and watched the whole thing. I, as you don't know am a female, and there's something about Rock with no shirt on that attracts me. (laughs) Jane Wyman was, well, lets say believable- at times. Sure she stopped after bumping into things and felt her way around rooms with her fingertips, but when Merrick, (Rock Hudson) spoke to her she would often look right at him, also her eyes were straight ahead and she'd move them around often in the same direction as she was going. It would have been better if she worked on this a little more.  Certainly though, being only 16, but an AVID classic fan, I don't know everything, but I try to notice the little things.  So my advice to people out there- if your a Rock Hudson fan as I am, rent it, when he's scrubbing up for ""her operation"" near the end, and-oops! has no shirt on..well thats theatre gold!! thanks for the memory. erin",literal
"More like: Now dont' make sense I'm sorry but when creating a movie, the easiest think to do is for the movie to make sense from a logical point of vue.

Is it too much to ask for the cut scene to make more scene.

If someone is shot around the neck area, how is it possible that he receives a bullet near the belt.

I dont know if you guys ever been to prison, but people who steal something worth half a billion dollars aren't put in your low budget prison even if the place is remote.

And again never saw a prison without any cameras.

This movie summed up everything that is wrong with movies nowadays, using CHI for everything, wasting Millions while creating a movie while not investing any resource on the plot twist and on the logical stand point.

Literally half the scenes dont make any sense.",literal
"Good visuals and tension let down by its script What's up people? Stop reviewing those found-footage tapes you've magically stumbled across and check out my review of Shelby Oaks.

I was excited for this one as it's the directorial debut of Chris Stuckmann, it's a film I backed through crowdfunding and my name is on the special edition poster alongside 15,000 other backers but was it money well spent?

Shelby Oaks is a found-footage spiritual horror. When a group of kids goes missing, all of their bodies except Riley's are found. Riley's sister Mia obtains tapes from the incident, becomes convinced Riley is still alive and takes matters into her own hands.

First off, Shelby Oaks looks like a legit Hollywood film. So, money well spent in that department. What worked for me was the tension built through camera angles, set locations and good direction. What didn't work quite as well was the script. There were too many conveniences and character decisions that didn't add up. The ending also felt anticlimactic, leaning heavily on the spiritual horror angle seemingly for the sake of it.

Overall, Shelby Oaks is an okay horror movie with decent visuals and tension but lacking in a solid story. Ultimately, I'm happy to have contributed towards this project and I'm excited that Chris Stuckmann is officially on his Hollywood directing journey. I'm look forward to what's next!",figurative

We need more glendas because she fought the whole system to make sure the victims got the justice they deserved. She made her voice heard. Nobody else could of played this part like evan peters.

"Awesome movie I just watched this movie and it was really interesting and funny. I found it a really cute love story and a great retelling of the roof man. I would recommend it if you're looking for a fun and cute watch. Keep in mind the roof man is a criminal, but still a really nice watch. Acting was great! I think they did the story really well and didn't just make him look like a good or bad guy. I hate when entertainment makes criminals look like they did nothing wrong. This shows that criminals can be good and bad. No one is one dimensional.",figurative

"It's not too bad but it is heavy handed I consider this a second tier show, it is entertaining but some of the characters and character relationships are kind of like virtue signalling with jazz hands; OTT.

BUT the single worst character by a mile is the mother...Jesus wept the portentous faux gravitas tone is irritating in the extreme. Truly awful characterisation.",figurative
"Very solid show! This spin-off of ""Law & Order"" is extremely solid and every episode is always a pleasure to watch.

The show is about a new elite squad of NYPD detectives who investigate sexually oriented crimes. So you would kind of expect that ever episode would be the same; someone gets raped and the SVU is send out to solve it. This however is not the case, every episode is extremely original. Kudos to that! OK so maybe the stories are pretty far fetched at times but that doesn't take away any of the quality of the show.

Only real complaint I have about the series is that it misses a good solid main character. ""Law & Order"" had Lennie Briscoe (Jerry Orbach) and ""Law & Order: Criminal Intent"" has Robert Goren (Vincent D'Onofrio) but ""Law & Order: Special Victims Unit"" doesn't have a good solid leading character. Neither Elliot Stabler (Christopher Meloni) or Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay) are interesting enough. Best characters are the ones that always play the smaller roles such as; Capt. Donald Cragen (Dann Florek), John Munch (Richard Belzer, that guy has got style! Hard to believe he is well over 60 years old already.) and Odafin ""Fin"" Tutuola (Ice-T). At first I didn't really liked Ice-T in this, I don't know for some reason he seemed nervous about acting in this to me but he now often gives away a very solid performance. The B.D. Wong character Dr. George Huang is a bit of a weird one to me, he is an all knowing character that truly knows everything and always has an answer and an opinion ready. He feels like a kind of unrealistic character to me, even though I really always have liked B.D. Wong as an actor. I'm also glad Alexandra Cabot (Stephanie March) got replaced by ADA Casey Novak (Diane Neal), she is a way better character!

The show is very likable to watch. The guest appearances are like in all ""Law & Order"" series, always top-class and the fact that the show lacks a good main character doesn't take away any of the quality of the show.

"Entertaining fluff I had doubts at first about Palm Royale, which follows an ethically challenged beauty queen desperate to break into high society. At first, she just seemed awful, as did most of the other people, and her dream seemed so petty and dumb. The movie was more appealing for its set design and campy acting than anything else.

But the series surprised me, giving increasing depth to the protagonist and offering just a little bit of complexity to it all.

The series also gets crazier and crazier with the twists and turns as it goes along, reaching a level of over-the-top goofiness by the end that's just lots of fun.

I did feel the cliffhanger at the end was too dark for the series, and I hope they quickly clear away the rubble they created with that when season two begins. But overall, this is terrific fun and well worth watching.",literal
"Kim Wexler: the Perfect Woman and the Antithesis of Skylar White Not only is Rhea Seehorn, who plays Kim, extremely pretty, but the character is rich and deep in ways every person should aspire to be. In short, Kim Wexler is the polar opposite and the very antithesis of Skylar White.

Kim, alone, is enough to not only watch Better Call Saul, but to rate it a 10.

The thing is, that BEYOND the 'perfect woman' that is Kim, it isn't only she who makes up the wonderful tapestry of interwoven majesty that is this series. As if her character were not enough to convince you of this series' greatness, on top of it, you have a myriad of characters almost as fabulous and just as engaging. To not list them all would be an insult; and yet to list them all would be an exercise in futility. Not only is every major character written and directed as only the geniuses who brought us Breaking Bad could write and direct them, but they are portrayed fabulously by everyone onscreen. EVEN the extras and lesser-used characters are standouts.

Now, Better call Saul moves at a pace that is not for everyone. The story progresses somewhat more slowly than other series/shows. The plus side is that it gives you time to enjoy each moment of this subtle (not slap-you-in-the-face, willy-nilly), but delightfully presented jewel of a look into the time before the monumentally amazing story of Breaking Bad took place.

I can't say it enough: watch it. If you watched some and thought it was not for you, watch it again. You'll thank me.",literal
"It stings, but its warm after that I love Billy Bob Thornton, and this is very well directed and shot. The story is good, but I do have a problem with the way that some of the women are depicted. They say and do things in a family context that doesn't happen -- like wearing underwear in front of Dad, and making crude sexual comments in a family setting. These women, particularly the wife, are just gorgeous, and I really have grown to like their characters, but still cringe at some of the things that they say. Anyway, I am waiting for the next one, and I do feel that Taylor Sheridan is a surpreme Artist despite some bad calls. I usually would rank this a 10, but I did take three stars off because women are being preyed upon because men think that they are like the women in this series. Whoever did the opening artwork is a master. In fact the entire series is masterful, and stings, but is also like warm honey. Thank you.",literal
"What a load of miserable gits inhabit these reviews! I appreciate people have very different tastes - we like different things. But some of these comments (as is often the case online) cross the line from expressing a point of view to being downright aggressive and cruel (a bit like the title of this review)! People are on the receiving end of your reviews, so be kind!

As for this show, I thought it was excellent entertainment. And that's what it is meant to be: entertainment. It's not history. It's not a drama doc. It's not a statement of Britain's position in international information gathering.

To appreciate this show, I think you need to understand irony, which runs deep in this comedic spy caper. It's Brits laughing at ourselves. It's Brits poking fun at the establishment. It's Brits enjoying seeing the ""underdog"" triumph over the smug, privileged and powerful. It's all that and more.

So, sit back, enjoy excellent acting, a tight script with so many jokes coming so fast that you might miss them, and something that offers a typically British counterpoint to the glossy ""24"", ""The Americans"" et al spy genre that tends to originate in the USA (not that I'm against them, they have their place too).

For me, it lost 2 stars because I felt the final episode was rather predictable and more improbable than the show deserved.",literal

"Seen it all 100 times already Its not a bad film, but very mediocre, by-the-numbers, predictable and cheesy. The humour is typically juvenile in James Gunn style and not really funny. It was OK but nothing special.

Lex Luthor in this movie is not a patch on Gene Hackmans version, Nicholas Hoult is a great actor but the character is REALLY one dimensional in this film, like a parody Lex Luthor. The actors that play Superman and Lois do an OK passable job but nothing great. The plot is your typical entirely predictable superhero fayre, I wont be interested in the Supergirl film if it is this standard of movie.

In summary this was a remake that didn't need to be made. Doesn't add anything new.",literal

"Christmas Vacation If there ever was someone who understood the effects of Murphy's Law it's the always-maligned Clark Griswold who just wanted the perfect family Christmas and instead is leveled with one disaster after another. If Clark isn't battle scarred from putting up Christmas lights, he's contending with problems with the tree. Bickering relatives, long-awaited bonus(which doesn't turn out to be what Clark was hoping for so he could pay for a new pool), Cousin Eddie, getting locked in the attic while the family is gone(not to mention getting smacked in the face with the attic latter and falling out altogether while watching old family reels on the projector), an overcooked turkey, Cousin Eddie, a sled ride that goes terribly wrong..did I mention Cousin Eddie? With plenty of Chevy Chase zingers(his demand at the end that no one leaves when all is not well, what he'd like to tell his (insert insults here) boss who screwed him over regarding the late ""bonus"", and especially his comments about Eddie), slapstick, and one hell of a supporting cast, ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"" stands the test of time as a real comedy Christmas classic worth revisiting every single year. The mayhem brought on by one nightmarish scenario after another(the tree going up in flames thanks to Uncle Lewis' cigar, the cat getting ""lit up"" when Clark plugs in the lights, Eddie filling the Griswold sewer with ""toxic s#it"", a runaway squirrel causing the family to panic, etc.)provides plenty of chuckles. Before this film John Hughes was mainly putting out teenage fare, but afterward you'd have other Christmas slapstick comedies like HOME ALONE where destruction in a cartoony fashion would erupt on the unlucky. Probably the last great comedy Chase would be a part of; the next decade wasn't as kind as the 80s.",literal

Gilmore Girls delves into every aspect of the human experience, and I now understand why people refer to this as a ""comfort"" show.

It's not afraid of showing and delving into its characters and their flaws, even that of the protagonist (which is a rarity to be found in many shows and movies made today).

Overall, this show will leave you feeling warm, fuzzy and oddly understood.",figurative
"Much better american take then I would have expected Update 3es Season I did like the British version but felt it bogged down in certain story lines. When I saw this was being remade I figured they would ruin it for an American audience. It stays pretty true to the orginal story making some changes that have are necessary. But frankly a fairly good remake. I think it will find legs and get a couple seasons there is a lot of stories they haven't gotten into from the British version. Please dont bring in the long lost sister I think that ruined the third series.

Update start of third season. Oh they went and ruined it they had a hit on their hands and they have trashed it I'm not even sure I want to watch it anymore.",literal
"Excellent! When I first saw an ad for this, I thought why are we recreating ER with Noah Wyle again? So many shows seem to just be recreations these days. But this is a completely different show. This show is real and raw with excellent acting and storylines. It does get very intense and emotional but appropriately so. This is probably the most realistic hospital show I've seen. We get glimpses in the medical staff's lives without any ""soap opera"" stories. Even though we are thrown into a day in a busy ER, we get to know the characters quickly due to great writing with surprises scattered throughout the season. I look forward to seeing season 2 of this great new drama. Noah Wyle is excellent!",literal
"Favorite show of all time If I'm bored I will rewatch this show rather than starting a new series! Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki are a perfect pair to be brothers on this show. Their chemistry on and off the screen is epic. And the whole cast is like one big family. My favorite episode is the one with the cat..... IYKYK. Baby is probably one of the most epic cars a franchise could have, he wapon trunk, I mean why wouldn't you have one. The characters and the story is an amazing on, of course there are some good episodes, great, sad and bad but you will still be wanting more. And with it coming back for a 16th season because the boys just didn't have enough is going to be awesome!!",literal
Go Fish A very solid show that sticks the landing even more so in the finale. Glen Powell is the star and he is crushing it in every episode with some of the best work of his career. I didn't expect this show to pull at the heart strings like it did and I thought several moments hit emotional beats perfectly. You really end up feeling for and rooting for Russ Holliday even after how insufferable he was to start. The comedy is also on point here in every episode. Chad Powers is a really fun watch and I hope there is more to come in the future.,figurative
"One of the best shows on TV now...and I'm looking forward to season two. ""Only Murders in the Building"" is a very good TV series which is airing currently on HULU. Its cast is most bizarre. While it's not at all surprising that Steve Martin and Martin Short star in the film (as they have toured together doing a recent comedy act), pairing them with Selena Gomez is just weird...though it works. The three are fans of real crime podcasts and when a death (and possible murder) appears in their apartment building, they decide to do their own podcast...and crazy complications ensue.

The show works well for a variety of reasons. It's highly original, though this alone don't make it an exceptional show. The dialog and supporting characters and writing...they all combine to make for a very compelling mini-series...so compelling that I am eagerly looking forward to season two. And, the way season one ends, it's obvious that there must be a second season.",literal

They are both to overboard when it comes to proper procedures and seem to ""know it all"". They both try to take charge regardless of the situation. Bailey shows up everywhere. Way over the top. They do not show respect for anyone and are braggarts. Season 3 is a bit off from the usual The Rookies I enjoy. I'm still watching it, and hoping the series returns to the good story lines that we viewed in the first 2 seasons. Most of the characters are really likable.",literal
"What? I can't believe I set through this painfully slow series for this finale. What a waste of time! I kept thinking that it'd get better and the finale would be worth it. It wasn't. The storyline is just too convoluted and messy and with no good resolutions. Also, if you'd read the synopsis of the book this is ""based"" on you'll know it's quite a leap!

The set design, the costumes, and the cars were fantastic! Alas, even those aren't worth the watch.

Carol Burnett is an absolute gem and I loved seeing her again. Ricky Martin was fun to watch but I feel he was held back in the role and didn't get to fully shine. He is a beautiful man to look at though. Laura Dern, who I typically adore, just grated on my nerves in this role and too old for the role. She looked like she was playing dress up. Kristin Wiig was brilliant at times but she took up way too much of the screen time; and yes, I know it was her character's story.",figurative
"Worst Jurassic Park/World by FAAAR Worst Jurassic Park by far. Absolutely terrible movie. Small very predictable spoilers included.

First off they give us no reason to like the characters at all. They are poorly written and you spend the first half of the movie wondering if they are the good guys or bad guys. This absolutely ruins the suspense or any scare factor because were not sure if were even supposed to like them. They introduce a character that is supposed to be a lazy know-nothing and then 10 minutes later they have this completely un-earned character development scene where suddenly we're supposed to respect him? It happens way too early in the movie and the one good thing he does hardly outlays all of his awful behavior prior to that. Scarlet Johansens character is only in it for money the whole time and is supposed to be this mercenary soldier person but when it comes down to it she can't hit the broad side of a barn with any weapon they give, or she's screaming for help.

The CGI is abundant and terribly done. There is a small cargo plane pulling 6g turns for no reason, it looks like a cartoon. It seems like they had no plan when shooting the scenes with the real actors. Often times they are acting in the wrong direction or not reacting to things happening on screen. I swear the CGI team has never even seen a boat before. All the of the boat scenes dont make sense. From the ""crew"" just running around randomly to the guy that understands english but only speaks french the whole movie, to the listing of the boat being completely inconsistent. The boat gets hit by a dinosaur at one point and none of the actors even move. It gets bumped on the hull and for some unexplained reason it then starts pluming thick black smoke from somewhere else unexplained. What was even damaged? Then with litteraly an entire ocean to escape in they decide to drive right into the sharp rocks?

There are weird things that happen seemingly for no reason, like needing to fire a rifle from the very exposed extended bow of the boat while being roped into it when they could have just fired from the safety of the deck. A guy in a facility where everyone is wearing tyvex suits and masks and eye protection chowing a snickers and dropping the wrapper on the ground, then it gets sucked into an intake vent on a door? Why the F is there an intake vent on door? And why is it on the ground?? Then that snickers wrapper causes the door to fail which then causes the entire security and computer system to fail, releasing all the dinosaurs. I mean come on. That is even lazier writing that ""somehow Palpetine returned"". Its like they think we're stupid.

There are literally only 8 types of dinosaurs in this movie. 8. And for some reason they all give up on eating everyone after like 2 minutes of trying.

This movie has more plot holes that ive ever seen in one movie. At one point a T-rex picks up and inflatable raft and crushes it, only to put it back down and it doesn't have any marks. Like not even a scratch, AND it's still perfectly inflated. Then they use the raft to PADDLE away slowly from it. AND IT JUST GIVES UP! What happened to T-Rex's being intelligent hunters like in the original trilogy?

There is ZERO continuity in this film. One character badly hurts his leg and needs a cane to walk then suddenly can carry a child and run? His limp completely disappears half way through the movie. Keep in mind this movie takes place over 2 days.

There is a scene where one character has a gun and runs out of ammo, then proceeds to act as if it is still loaded, then in the next scene the gun is gone!

There is a guy with his hand handcuffed to a brief case and suddenly the handcuff disappears when the other characters need to grab it. Like not even a broken chain or broken handcuff. Its just not there anymore.

Spoilers after this part: The main big bad dinosaur is basically a rip off of the rancor in Star Wars Return of the Jedi. And it also gives up after 2 minutes and seeing a flare. One of the characters sacrifices himself by leading the dino away with a flare, and get this, SWIMMING. He gets away SWIMMING... WITH A FLARE IN HIS HAND. HOW DOES HE NOT GET EATEN??? Then somehow he gets away and shoots another flare so he can be rescued, but the dino now suddenly doesnt care about flares?

In conclusion, it is a terrible movie. I want my 2 and a half hours back.",literal
"I mean, the next thing you know, you'll be wearing a bra on your head!... ""Weird Science"" is definitely one of the memorable movies from the 1980's, and it is without a doubt also one of the movies that instantly comes to mind when you think movies from the 1980's. Furthermore, it is a classic in its own right, and it is a movie that you can watch over and over again.

The story is about Gary (played by Anthony Michael Hall) and Wyatt (played by Ilan Mitchell-Smith), two high school students without any luck with the women and often at the end of the bullies shenanigans. After seeing a ""Frankenstein"" movie on late night TV, they decide to create their own ideal woman (played by Kelly LeBrock) on the computer. But when their creation takes physical form and becomes a real woman, the two teenagers find that their luck has changed and popularity is just around the bend.

When you watch ""Weird Science"" these days you are just amused with the graphics that were used in the movie back in the day. Sure, it was grand and impressive back then. And seeing that is a nostalgic trip back to the glorious 1980's.

It is a combination of the storyline, the characters and the cast ensemble that makes the movie stand out so nicely and work so well.

The cast list includes Kelly LeBrock which is very much the epitome of the 1980's for many men whom were young adults or adults during the 1980's. But it also has some other impressive appearances, for example Bill Paxton in the hilarious role of Chet, but also Robert Downey Jr. and Robert Rusler as the two high school bullies. Furthermore, there is also some nice appearances by Vernon Wells and Michael Berryman as two bad guys.

If you were watching movies during the 1980's, then chances are slim to none that you are not already familiar with this lovable movie. And on the off-chance that you aren't already familiar with ""Weird Science"", then do take the opportunity to sit down and watch it should you get the chance. This is a very enjoyable movie in every way.",literal
"Sinners draws me back to the 'Sin'ema! I really enjoyed Sinners! Not a perfect movie but definitely a good one. It's giving ""cult classic"" vibes for me. We don't get a lot of original content nowadays that isn't already tied to a franchise or existing IP so thank you Ryan Coogler for creating something artful with a story of its own. Admittedly, the protagonist ""Preacher Boy"" sparked immediate comparisons for me to urban legend blues man archetypes like Robert Johnson but stands out in how this character's story is told. It feels personal. It feels inspired and I was along for the ride. For me, Sinners is the live action version of an Ernie Barnes painting, particularly ""The Sugar Shack"", and I am so here for bringing back such depictions of Black life and art. There is a powerfully moving juke joint scene that motivates the darker themes of the film while simultaneously shining in pushing both narrative and nostalgia. It weaves ancestry and anarchy masterfully. And it proves why we need more black creators in the supernatural horror genre! Michael B. Jordan is getting the well deserved attention for his performances but I would argue to say that this is an ensemble effort where everyone sunk their teeth into their respective roles. Final thought: If From Dusk Till Dawn, Idlewild, & Eve's Bayou had a one night stand they would conceive Twins called Smoke & Stacks.",literal
"Derivative of Only Murders in The Building, with all the flaws of that show too. Derivative of the moderately enjoyable (for one season) Only Murders In The Building. Cliches about baby boomers as mindless out of touch octogenarians, when the characters really act and are younger than that......and are overseen by gen x-ers who are condescending and overbearing. IRL, this is not the dynamic of nursing homes / retirement communities (which are actually way sadder that anything depicted here). A few good one liners and life-story insights make it worth watching for a few episodes, but generally this is pablum for the masses.

As I generally approach the age of some of these characters, I am seriously I insulted by the way the characters of all ages in this show are depicted. The younger generation is a multicultural caricature; the drunken, horny female 3:15 happy hour residents are an embarrassing cliche. Then the show tries to finish with 'life lessons' that are no more than instagram-friendly 'be-happy' cliches.",literal
"Unrelatable I think I have to care or relate to the main character, and this guy is... Unrealistic. A cartoon version of a Corp drone. So I find his delusions annoying and really uninteresting. I don't know what is going on - which is fine - but I don't care either. I usually love offbeat shows, but this one is just boring. Not sure about the show's appeal.",literal
"WOW I'm hooked I read a critic's review somewhere that the only thing wrong with this new series is that Ben Stiller dragged out the first few episodes too slowly just for character development. Not at all! I was immediately immersed in the story, the characters' development was a natural consequence. Very titillating, every second of it, waiting for the next tidbit of information, the next clue to the mystery. A mystery I suspect will be more convoluted than at first glance.",literal
"Edgar for hire. 'The Running Man (2025)' is the first film directed by Edgar Wright that feels as though it would have not only been made, but been more or less the same without his involvement. It's basically what 'Ant-Man (2015)' would've been like if he didn't decide to leave over creative differences. That's not to say that the movie could've been directed by anyone, just that it could've been directed with anyone good. There's very little of the specific flair he's known for, even if it does pop up here and there, and there isn't the crystal clear clarity of vision that's arguably the most important asset he brings to a production. Still, none of this is to suggest that the film isn't a fairly fun blockbuster actioner. It's a very different flavour to the more overtly campy original, but it's still heightened and absurd and playing around with satirical elements that are as humorous as they are on-the-nose. It feels as though it would be the perfect framework to hang some extremely tight, fast-paced and satisfying set-pieces on, but the action is never anything more - or less - than simply sturdy. It's exciting enough, but it doesn't exactly blow you away with its freneticism, inventiveness or charm. That's a good way to describe the overall affair, actually. It's always just above perfectly serviceable, but rarely anything more. Its third act really struggles to tie everything together, feeling as though it tries to do too much and not enough all at once, and its quirky elements are too subdued to make a genuine lasting impression. It all feels fairly forgettable, despite its committed performances (including from Glen Powell, who plays every single moment as if he's seconds away from exploding due to the pure rage running through his veins, and Josh Brolin, who chews on a set of fake teeth that are permanently fashioned into a smarmy grin) and its confidently crafted and suitably grungy dystopian setting that serves as an apt environment for its propulsive carnage and ham-fisted theming. Its genuinely pretty entertaining for what it is, but it's also vaguely underwhelming. Its better than it could have been, sure, but it's also not quite as good as I'd hoped it would be when I first learned who was involved with it. It's a rock-solid version of a movie we've all seen before, but it's honestly nothing especially noteworthy. Although it has some really fun sequences, it eventually finds itself running out of steam.",literal

"Stupendous After the S01 finale, I conclude this is the best Apple TV+ show overall as of April 2022.

For All Mankind might have a higher production value (because of the budget and theme) but regarding all other aspects, music, direction, writing... this is probably the best one thus far.

Can't wait for S02! Highly recommended for everyone who's into drama or mysterious, mind-bending stuff or just wants to watch something clever.",literal
"Sigh... what a fail I was such a huge fan of the original, I've probably seen it at least 20 times. I was so excited for this sequel! The writing is god awful, the pacing slow, I didn't laugh once or have fun at any point! Freaky Friday is iconic and has so many quotable one-liners, ""I look like the crypt keeper!""

I at gun point could not tell you anything any character said during this movie. Surprised it went to theaters feels like straight to DVD material.",figurative
"we need a reunion - badly! I just finished watching all seven seasons on Netflix, and at the end, it was like saying goodbye to an old friend.

This is just a wonderful series about a single mom Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and her daughter Rory (Alexis Biedel), as Rory goes through high school and Yale, and Lorelai has several romances and a couple of engagements, most notably with Luke (Scott-Gordon Patterson). I became very involved with Lorelai, Rory, Luke, Lane, Sookie, and everyone in Stars Hollow. And then there is Lorelai's on again/off again relationship with her mother (Kelly Bishop) and father (Edward Herrmann). I wanted to live in Stars Hollow, too.

My only problem with the show (and it's minor) is that as witty and sparkling and fast as the dialogue is, sometimes Lorelai's repartee is just too much. Also, although Rory and Lorelai had a wonderful relationship, sometimes I felt like they were too close -- Lorelai is going to have some real issues with Rory out in the world.

That's one reason why I want a reunion -- to see how everything panned out with Rory, Lorelai, and Luke.

I can hope.",literal
TEAM JESS I still can't believe how someone can destroy so much a serie by messing up the ending. From the moment that Jess was added to the story I knew that he was the one. And don't get me started on the University fiasco. Rory wasn't a quitter. But somehow she managed to quit on her epic love and her dreams.,literal
"Great casting, depressing stories One of the best castings in any series.

Unfortunately the subject matter is... heavy, and reflects on some of the actors (Mandy most notably), as it should, but you'll never see better characters written and acted as Penelope and Derek; the chemistry is beautiful and Garcia is the little light in the darkness who always has problems coping with the violence; as one should.

Only downsides are the ""personal"" stories of every team member that suddenly involve a serial killer hunting/related/dating etc. One of them.

Writing is great as is the directing (unusual shots depending on the derangement of the killer of the day).

Storytelling and pacing on the episodes is fantastic but repetitive (after 10+ years) If you can handle the, unfortunately realistic, violence this is one of the best shows out there.",literal
"Eddington..... and Problems Nice movie to be honest ! I just saw it in theater and i found it pretty good but i dont really know what the real purpose of this movie ! Just to tell an entertaining story with some complications in the town with some politics , love and some violence ? Or just what happened in that decadent society ? Maybe ... The concept was interesting with that theme of Covid and a Western but when i finally watched the movie i was like : whats the real purpose of that movie ? Because even at the end you just thinking : it was entertaining and had some interesting themes and reflexions but .... Yeah for what purpose ?

Dont get me wrong i did enjoy the movie but still didnt get the whole purpose of it but i found the story pretty interesting and we got some nice revelations and unexpected moments ( when Joe kill the Garcia boys, the truth and the horrible connections between them and Joe's wife .....)

The music was an interesting experience and the sound design too during the gunshots and also the differents moments of the movie . We got also some reflexions there and there about pedophile theme and the rape of Joe's wife . Also some Racial talks about white suprematia and also some things like this about white privilege but dont go much further and just make some consequences of it but nothing more .

We got also the investigations of The Garcia murder who happened a little bit late and feel like the real talks and problem was before this because after this its only gunshots and murders .

The ending dont let us to really know more just how everyone are and it end like this and Joe will never confront the public of his murders and it could give a nice moments but anyway..... we got also that story of isolation with that pandemia but thats all and launch the confrontation between Joe and Tedd.

What else to say ? I found Joaquin Phoenix did a nice performance like Pedro Pascal and give an interesting confrontation all along the movie . So yeah pretty good story but not that deep to be honest but watchable and still have some interesting reflexions, revelations , characters and music . I really recommend .",literal
"Great movie Really great movie with a positive message and lots of humor, didn't know Keanu could be so funny. I would highly recommend this to anyone right now. The message is really good especially with how the world is right now.

"The best historical drama I've ever seen Writing, acting, directing, just top notch across the board. I won't single anyone out, they could all be nominated for major awards. I have no criticisms at all.

In fact, as a history major, I appreciate the fact that even when dramatic license is taken, it is true to the spirit and truth of reality. That's a tricky thing and they navigate it so well that I don't mind minor exaggerations or embellishments.

This is my favorite genre. It is incredibly rare, if not unheard of, to have a historical drama that can't really be picked apart and called out for gross inaccuracies.

All this while creating a fascinating, compelling, engaing story with witty, intelligent writing, flawless delivery, perfect pacing and a clearly understood plot. It leaves you extremely satisfied, despite the inevitable ending.

Exceptionally well done.",literal
"Sunday Sizzler with its Roots in the Dramas of the Seventies and Eighties What can one say about Debbie Horsfield's rendering of Winston Graham's evergreen series of classics that has not been said before? Being old enough to remember the 1975 version when Robin Ellis strode through the West Country with his scanty undershirt revealing a hairy chest and equally distinguished sideburns, I was impressed with Aidan Turner's recreation of the same role. Turner has a wonderful gift for smoldering; his features do not change much, but his eyes flash and his lips purse in a way that brooks no resistance from anyone. George Warleggan (Jack Farthing) is an eminently hissable villain, his pasty face and arrogant mien contrasting with Robin Poldark's humanity. The facial and bodily contrasts between the two resembles that of any great melodrama. We know George will get his comeuppance in the end, but we marvel at the extent to which he is prepared to manipulate others in order to achieve his aims.

Filmed on the rolling Cornish coast, POLDARK knows how to make the best use of its locations, filming its protagonists against the setting sun or having them walk alone among deserted beaches or wading into the sea. There are also plenty of opportunities for Ross to be shown either shirtless or sweat-soaked down the mine, moving in close proximity to his fellow-workers in lurid orange light. We can understand from their expressions how committed they are to their futures, despite George's best efforts to impede them.

In truth the structure of each episode is a tad repetitive, with Ross and his wife (Eleanor Tomlinson) having to overcome a series of struggles both mental as well as professional: negotiating obstacles like Scylla and Charybdis so that they can arrive at a happy end. But the production, directed by a variety of artists, is constructed with such élan, with plenty of swash, buckle and romance that we are scarcely aware of its schematics. The BBC used to distinguish itself with these kind of dramas of a Sunday night - there was HOWARDS WAY set in the contemporary era that enjoyed a long run. How pleasant to see the new POLDARK perpetuating that tradition.",literal
"Beautiful in every sense, Moana will soften even the hardest of hearts Moana is a return to the classic Disney formula, the clichés and characters ripped from a number of other animated films. However, the pure beauty and skill of the production rises the old story into new heights.

Following from the success of Zootropolis, Moana follows a more traditional narrative we know and love; the princess who wishes for something more and is whisked on a supernatural adventure. We know this story so well yet Moana seems fresh and thrilling as if the plot was innovative. Perhaps this is due to the Polynesian setting or the morally ambiguous Maui, played perfectly by Dwayne Johnson, but most likely it is it the simple magic of Disney – the wonder for both children and adults has reached its peak with the perfection of the classic formula. For once, the clichés make the film more enjoyable. The quality of the animation helps too: it's clear they have reached the pinnacle of blending realistic textures with stylised designs, creating an aesthetic beauty that few other companies can match – Disney have mastered water to the point it looks better animated than in real life! Even the music has been perfected here, the annoying catchiness of Frozen's tunes replaced by memorable but effective songs that fit the culture and setting of our adventure. A childlike warmth was awakened in me and many other adult members of the audience as the film brought the emotional highs of the Disney renaissance without the modern subversion of the classic tropes. While Moana sometimes threatens this with pop culture references, the film thankfully keeps to mostly traditional values and morals; a step above many children's animated films released today.

Moana is good, old fashioned Disney magic; the traditional narrative and morals updated with stellar animation and an awareness that's effective but never overpowering enough to threaten the integrity of the Disney formula.

"Magic, Misdirection, and a Bold New Illusion Review of Now You See Me 3 Rating: 7/10

Plot Now You See Me 3 follows the Four Horsemen as they reunite for another high-stakes mission filled with deception, global intrigue, and mind-bending magic. This time, they are drawn into a new conspiracy involving rival illusionists and a powerful underground organization. To survive, they must orchestrate their most ambitious and intricate performance yet-one that blurs the line between illusion and reality more than ever before.

Strengths The film delivers stylish set pieces, clever heist mechanics, and energetic pacing. The signature magical flair of the franchise is intact, with creative illusions and slick visual sequences that keep the audience engaged. The returning cast provides strong chemistry, and new characters bring fresh tension and humor. The expanded lore around the Eye adds intrigue and a sense of mystery that fans will appreciate.

Overall Impressions With its polished spectacle, charismatic performances, and thrilling twists, Now You See Me 3 is a fun and satisfying continuation of the series. While not every reveal lands perfectly, the movie offers enough charm and cleverness to entertain, making it a solid entry for fans of magical heist films.",figurative

"Mediocre Writing and Bad Acting I watched this one because of Sarah Snook and I was not rewarded. The writing is mediocre even cheesey at times. It felt very formulaic and there's a bunch of family drama that's used as filler. The acting is sub-par, Sarah Snook is really mediocre in this series. There's a Hispanic character in this series who has a horrible accent, it was so annoying, like the actress took accent lessons from Speedy Gonzalez. Overall I was three episodes and out.",literal

"Gloomy The Black Rabbit is a decent series but not for everyone. This series is full of gloom, doom, unnecessary overuse of the f-bomb and brain cell killing music. But there were also a lot of good parts. The two bothers are deeply flawed but have a bond that can't be broken. They both prove they would do anything for family, even if they shouldn't. There is a lot going on in the Black Rabbit, so you need to pay attention or you could get lost.",literal
"I still don't get why his wife is included in this series. For someone so focused on his goals, the inclusion of an emotionally unstable, one-woman circus undermines the purpose of the show entirely. It feels like her character disrupts the central narrative, adding unnecessary chaos rather than supporting his journey. The portrayal doesn't enhance the storyline but instead makes it harder to take his determination and focus seriously.

Similarly, the roles of both his wife and daughter feel out of place within the series. The wife comes across as emotionally erratic, while the daughter seems to lack intellectual depth, making her contributions to the plot negligible. The daughter's portrayal feels particularly shallow, with her character offering little beyond surface-level engagement, which doesn't add value to the story.

Moreover, having these characters constantly jump around in provocative clothing, seemingly for no purpose other than to attract views, feels out of sync with the tone of the series. Instead of enhancing the plot or character dynamics, this approach comes off as a superficial tactic to draw attention. It's a strange and unneeded addition that detracts from the overall quality of the narrative.",figurative
"solid international intrigue with great performances Netflix has disappointed me recently with so little worth watching, so it was great to stumble across The Diplomat, which is like a series they would have made years ago.

The biggest attraction is seeing Keri Russell, Rufus Sewell, Allison Janney, Rory Kinnear and Ali Ahn give kickass performances. The cast overall is very strong.

The plotline starts slow in S1, as the setting and characters are built up. By the end of S1, the plot becomes clear and then roars along in S2. It's good to watch the first two seasons back to back like I did. They keep ramping up the stakes, which makes it maybe a little too easy to see where they are going with this, but it's still a lot of fun.

Another noteworthy element that a lot of viewers might skip over: the costuming and use of color in the sets, costumes and interiors. Stuff like, the characters wearing more blue to the Fourth of July event; costumes being coordinated with the set colors; or the comic/ironic contrast of a fancy gown being worn in a decidedly gritty and fraught scene. Somebody is putting a lot of thought into all this.",literal
"great to watch if your mad at someone and wanna hate someone else for an hour This movie is really good at making you hate the main character who is a woman that IS GETTING MARRIED to literally the nicest person that she does not deserve at all, but let me tell you the story. So she can't sleep because she's too stressed about the WEDDING and then there's this other guy who's getting dumped when we see him and drinks a lot, seems like a pretty garbage guy RIGHT? But anyway the girl can't sleep which is the main plot point and at the same time the guy can't sleep either, so then he goes for a walk, and she goes for a drive which is a very stupid thing to do, but anyway she runs him over. Then. Takes him to the hospital, then they start arguing, and they fall asleep in her car and since SHE CAN NEVER SLEEP she ends up going back to him to PAY HIM to sleep with her (OH BUT NOT LIKE THAT GUYS which is a running gag) then. She starts lying to go sleep with the guy in a hotel room while her boyfriend is working his job to pay FOR THEIR WEDDING WHILE SHE'S PAYING MONEY TO HIM and for the hotel there's also a boner seen which is just weird then josh finds out (the boyfriend) and he's mad (understandably) and she tells him that he just helps her sleep, and he tries to believe her even after that and takes them to a sleep clinic to see if they really can sleep next to each other, and she APOLOGIZES TO HIM not josh may I add at any point then they get to the wedding and at this point its just painful to see how much time she wasted of these poor people then she calls off the wedding and goes to find the guy in the just married car, and they live happily ever af.. no no these people really just suck, don't waste your time on this movie please? I'm begging you.",literal
"It's good but still has its issues Yellowstone is a very fine show with its beautiful cinematography and scenes of intense acting. It's 5 seasons long and probably didn't need to go on as long as it does but it gives you hours of entertainment.

It has its issues. Firstly, I don't know who I'm supposed to be supporting. None of the characters are particularly good people especially John Dutton. He's a narcissist and a bully to his own children who refuses to listen to anybody unless it suits his stubborn ways. He's a murderer and a boarder line sex offender and kidnapper. The character of Summer will tell you this. His sons are only thinking for themselves but Kasey who is portrayed as the ""good guy"" still murdered his brother in law without owning up to it. Beth is the worst character. Horrid alcoholic who has no right to get as far as she does in the show but for some reason Taylor Sheridan absolutely loves her and even gives her the nice send off she doesn't deserve. The actress overacted the part and by the final season, Yellowstone became Bethstone. Partly because Costner did what he does best and whinged about his character not surviving so left the show early. Nothing new with him. But S5 was just Beth Beth and some more Beth. She becomes tedious as she wasn't written to be a main character but that's what we were left with. The Jamie character was done dirty. We know him and Beth don't get along and for some reason, TS wrote him to become a monster with a murderous father( not John, no. A new father ) and it just feels a little forced. He was looking out for himself but after a whole life of being hated and abused, I don't blame him for wanting to hurt the Duttons! His death was predictable but uncalled for as ""you know who"" got to seal his fate.

Secondly: Away from the Duttons, characters such as Rain Water become obsolete as their original story just ends. Wranglers such as Walker become nothing characters and in his story, Walker just becomes the soundtrack. As wonderful as his songs are. Although Rip is probably the most popular character and he at least stays consistent.

The show has an intriguing storyline. It does have some fine acting, beautiful scenery and a couple of heart stopping moments with some good cliffhangers. But it's a confusing show. It does have an ending at least albeit spoiled by Costner being Costner. 7/10 and worth a watch. Just make your own mind up on the strange characters.",literal
"Excellent entertainment I agree with anyone that said this was better than last couple ones and glad I saw in RPX would've seen in imax if it had that but F1 is in that format which is phenomenal! The cinematography, great cast and some incredible scenes are the best aspects. I'm shocked that this is written by David Koepp he's a phenomenal writer at least for other films.

Jurassic World:Rebirth is a lot of fun doesn't deserve so much hate but I understand it too there's messy bits that are easy to bash like Scarlets character isn't entirely convincing as a security agent she's better in other roles and the bad guy is given away fast otherwise great stuff!",literal

"The Message Could have been good but, as usual, New Hollywood decided that The Message was more important than The Movie. And so, the other white males are either evil, idiotic or redneck; the black males are heroic; the wife and child are black (how many black women are called Sheila?); and the female contestant is a loud lesbian who spends much of the movie between other girls' legs. I mean, does it have to be broadcast so loudly? We even get reference to illegal immigrants, thus ensuring that the movie will feel dated within one year.....

If Wright had concentrated more on the action within the story and less on the preaching we could have gotten an exciting and exhilarating ride, but instead we got a sermon. It's Hollywood, baby!!

Also, the ending is rubbish (more preaching) - no idea why it was changed from the book.",literal
"Best Series Ever I say this because of the lead role played by Stallone. His tough guy character is believable. Even though there is violence in the series, the writers also make room for warmth and romance. What more could a tough guy ask for. He gives hope to the other characters around him. I wish Tulsa would come on more than one time a week. Thank God for Paramount!! I do not know what note the series will end on, but I can tell you that I can't wait for the next episode. The chemistry of the other actors is a perfect match. I haven't been this interested in watching a series for quite sometime. Keep up the great writing. Tulsa for me has been a long time coming.

"Shame of Thrones The ending of this series is a disservice to the public!

The first seasons are great as they are based on the books source material and, apparently, the writers are good enough at adapting other people ideas. After season four there's a decline, not so manifest at first since the goodness of the source material still lingers around. It's more of a slow deterioration, a spiral into shallow writing that peaks in a last season devoid of content and value. Where at first grand scale developments, societal issues and world-spanning intrigues dominated the narration with characters being the pawns of the true overarching story, later in the seasons characters and stereotypical interactions take the stage and the interesting, long developing issues that made the story captivating get resolved in the most unrewarding ways possible. It's incoherent, detached, uninspired writing. It's everything that is bad in mainstream media.

All of this because the writers decided they had enough with the show and grew bored with it. So they wanted to wrap it up as soon as possible in order to go on and ruin the Star Wars franchise (more than it already is). Thanks for your disservice!

It needs to be mentioned that the overall production, sound design, acting, cinematography, all of these are quite extraordinary and elevate the show quite a bit, even when the writing declines. The quality is amazing. It probably is still worth watching for its entertainment value. It just doesn't pay off. The ending season ruins quite literally everything.",literal

"A movie's movie - stunningly beautiful, mystical, haunting I absolutely loved the new 'IT' movie and didn't expect it to be that good. It is a perfectly paced and beautifully shot movie that captures some of the love for 80's horror movies.

But 'IT' is actually much more than just a rehash of a plain-old horror movie: The characters are all interesting and the kids' acting skills are surprisingly convincing and moving. You really do feel for them and you want them to succeed, which is really what makes a horror movie be a hit or a flop. The emotional subplots are not too shallow as well—the love story does not feel haphazardly attached onto everything else; the interactions between the characters feel meaningful and real.

The new clown is also quite well done with some very creepy acting and a compelling voice. What's more: I didn't even mind the CGI of the horror effects. Usually CGI puts me off, but here, everything was done rather well with some really suspenseful moments.

In the end, what really got me to love the new 'IT' is that this is a movie for people who love movies. The cinematography is just like true movie fans like it: Lots of stunning landscape and wide shots, perfect lighting and atmosphere, and on top of that a great score! What do you want more?",literal
"Someone(s) needed a paycheque 4 stars only because I love the action sequences but the storyline made no sense at all and it took nearly 20 minutes for the story to get going. I nearly fell asleep. Considering how selective Jesse Eisenberg is reported to be on his movie roles, he must have needed the money, that's the only reason I can figure why he'd do this movie. As far as I can figure out, the 3 young'uns didn't really need the original horsemen to accomplish their goal. The plot and writing were heavy handed, basically it's all a rehash of the other 2 movies. It was fan service to shovel in Morgan Freeman, his character was not needed and if his apparent death was supposed to bring the group together, it failed miserably. The hologram of Mark Ruffalo looked like something that could be done on a smart phone rather than high tech CGI. I think they were all sleepwalking through the movie. There were long facial shots when the actors were supposed to emote, they mostly looked dazed, probably wondering what the storyline was as much as I was. If they actually do a 4th movie, I hope they find a new writer.",figurative
"Nice to watch, but very superficial and cliche Really enjoyed the acting, especially the chemistry between Dakota and Chris, which felt natural and engaging. However, the characters lacked depth, and we barely learned anything about them. Instead, the story spends too much time on matchmaking details to push the writer's view that people chasing matches are materialistic. I found the storyline dull and clichéd, focusing on criticizing shallow standards in relationships. It portrays the male character, who offers nothing but emotional support, as perfectly acceptable despite being financially unstable in his late 30s, and not even figuring out what his life is going to be, which comes off as overly simplistic. Overall, the acting was a highlight, but the weak character development and predictable plot held it back.",literal
"Not a fan anymore I was a hardcore fan for 11 seasons. I've seen every episode, but this last season is absolutely the s'worst. I don't know if they got new writers, or the writers are just totally out of touch with the fanbase, but it has become ridiculous and soap-like. The Reid-line has taken forever, and it's really painful to watch. I think, I'll drop the show, and maybe pick it up again later, when they maybe get it back to it's former standards. But I fear, that this is it for Criminal Minds. With the downfall, I'm not sure it will survive for a 13th season.",literal
"great, gritty cop and robber drama Diane West is the weak link in the chain. Most of the parts I have seen her in she plays this same character: whiney and entitled B. Otherwise, a stellar cast with good energy. The first few episodes had some nudity and violence - hope they keep it real like that. Sad when these shows pull you in with reality and then get all TV guidelines on us. The direction is good. The plots are believable and keep you on the edge of your seat. The women and men are good looking. We like this one!",literal
"Affeksjonsverdi This is the first time i rate a movie on imdb. I watched it on cinema a couple of days ago and it is by far the best movie I have ever seen in my life. It's still stuck in my body, even from seeing it two days ago. Really, a masterpiece... Renate is perfect for the role, also the other actors makes it whole. I love how you can almost touch and feel the mood in the movie. Joachim Trier has done it again. This is Oscar worthy, and I hope everyone is watching this at least one time in their life.",figurative
"The movie tried to do somethig interesting, but didn't deliver Seemed like an interesting concept and some great actors in the cast. But for me it just didn't work at all. It just seemed like it got lost along the way. There seems like there might have been a good movie in there somewhere, but it just didn't do anything other than just show us chaos. Maybe it's showing that people are messy and full of chaos, but as a movie it was just all over the place and didn't click at all or give any sort of coherent story or message. Many of the characters were not fleshed out and were empty. A miss for me.",literal
"Who is the real criminal? Who should truly be sentenced to prison? Of course, robbing a McDonald's may seem wrong at first glance.

But sometimes, what looks like a crime on the surface reveals something much deeper underneath-a broken system where hard work and talent are not always rewarded.

When a man of skill and dignity can't even earn enough to feed his family, maybe the real question isn't why he broke the law, but why the law failed him first.

He loved Leigh Wainscott with a pure heart, trusting her completely. Yet that trust was used against him. She, together with the police, called it justice. But what kind of justice relies on deception? What kind of righteousness hides behind ""I love you""?

I am not saying he was innocent of every act-but isn't it worth asking who the real criminal is in a world where the powerful exploit the powerless without consequence?

As the old Chinese saying goes: ""Steal a hook and you're executed; steal a nation and you're crowned a lord."" It reminds us that sometimes punishment depends not on what we do, but on who we are.

A hungry man who takes a little to survive is condemned; yet those who take everything from millions through greed and manipulation are admired.

True justice should not serve the powerful alone-it should serve humanity.

Because worse than stealing money is stealing hope. Worse than breaking a law is breaking the belief that being good still matters.

If we lose that, what kind of society do we have left?",figurative
"Middling Directed by: Derek Cianfrance Written by: Derek Cianfrance, Kirt Gunn

SUMMARY

After breaking out from prison, a convict hides out inside a Toy 'R Us store, surviving undetected for months. However, his secret life begins to unravel as he falls for a divorced mom. Ultimately, despite being given a chance to escape the country, he risks everything to say goodbye - and is caught in the act.

RATING

B

Roofman tells the true story of Jeff Manchester, who escaped prison and hid out inside a Toys 'R Us. The movie captures his ingenuity and resourcefulness with flair, but it falters emotionally, drifting into a middling family drama halfway through. Lacking a true moment of crisis, the story feels predictable and safe. In the end, Roofman is a very good film that never quite dares to be great.",literal
"Not sure , I think I've read the books too recently Although there are many things that are better than the original series, I find I'm not drawn to many of the characters. Prudie and Jud were supposed to be bumbling, slothful, but humorous (Jud was bald and toothless, which the old series got right) Demelza was small and sometimes cheeky, whereas the new one is tall and angular,and more mature (she was only 15 or 16yrs old when she first appeared in the book).

Also at the ball, the dancers would have either powdered their hair or worn wigs, and Ross WOULD NOT have gone out anywhere with an unshaven look!

I've sometimes found that older series had more charm than the new ones, and this seems to be the case here. But for those who may be of a slightly younger generation than myself, I'm sure it's probably perfect, and hopefully some may be moved to try the books, which in my humble opinion are 10 times better!",literal

"This is the kind of movie that reminds you why theaters matter. Grab your popcorn, kick back, shut your brain off just enough, and enjoy the ride. For me, that's a win. Edgar Wright's The Running Man isn't just a remake, it's a reinvention. Instead of recycling the beats, tone, and camp of the 1987 Schwarzenegger film, Wright delivers a razor-sharp dystopian action thriller that actually feels made for 2025. It's bold, timely, and wildly entertaining.

I heard people were divided on this one. Honestly? I don't get it. This is exactly what a modern adaptation should look like. It's not trying to be the original. It's not mimicking nostalgia. It's a fresh, ambitious take wrapped in the cultural anxieties of today... surveillance, manipulated narratives, viral outrage, and a society that confuses entertainment with punishment. The commentary is there if you want it, but it never hits you over the head. Most of the people it's skewering probably won't even realize it.

If you've caught our live show on YouTube, you already know my stance on Glen Powell. Hollywood's current ""It guy""-is usually a big shrug. But credit where it's due, he delivers here. Powell brings a surprising mix of charm, desperation, and physicality. He gets comedic beats, he nails the intensity, and yes... the film gives the ladies a little something too. This is easily one of his best roles to date.

Wright's biggest deviation from the original? Moving the action out of the neon game-show arena and into the streets. Here, runners aren't in a controlled death maze-they're dumped into the real world and hunted in public, turning everyday citizens into potential threats. The media warps every moment, twisting the public's perception in real time. It feels uncomfortably plausible, which makes it all the more gripping.

The supporting cast is stacked and firing on all cylinders.

Josh Brolin brings grizzled gravitas.

Colman Domingo is phenomenal (as always), chewing scenes with quiet menace.

Michael Cera is bizarre, unsettling, and unexpectedly perfect for this world.

Everyone understands the assignment heightened, theatrical, but always grounded in Wright's controlled chaos, and if you are pissed if this is not the usual film from him, then you should have supported Last Night in Soho, a hidden gem masterpiece that flopped.

Most importantly, the movie knows what it is, a fast, fun, adrenaline-pumping popcorn flick. It's here to entertain you for two hours, to make you forget the outside world while it blasts through tightly choreographed action sequences, slick editing, and Wright's signature kinetic style.

And on that level? It nails it.",figurative
"Fictional stories of rinse and repeat Can this show be any more scripted than HGTV? I think not! Rinse and repeat on a non fiction scale could be palatable, but lets get real, no free man roams the earth kicking in doors, shooting at will and hacks into non existence networks and gets paid. Maybe this is the intentions of the writers, but for now it's just background noise for me. Although the main actor does a good job at defining the main character as some sort of ""know it all"" loner with a heart, they also are not doing him any favors in playing him as some sort of know it all ""Fall Guy"" impersonator. This is a filler for me and nothing else.",literal
"10/10 isn't enough So being a NCIS devote... Watching some good and some very poor spinoffs.. the original will always be the best..so strong and the original characters carried it through some epic seasons. Whilst I tried to love the newer replacements in the most recent seasons, it never carried the weight as well.

I was worried this would be a poor reflection of a long standing gap that needed some explanation in to the life of Gibbs.

If there was ever a reason to watch all the 20 something seasons again after this is it.

I'm binge watching it.. hooked with such perfect casting of Gibbs and Franks, the other lesser known characters like they fill the same slots as the well known latter NCIS people. This is the series to carry the mantle on. Please make at least 5 seasons right up to the point it becomes what we know as Gibbs and the legendary NCIS.",literal
"Disappointed :/ I really wanted to like this show. I saw all the ""best of"" clips on TikTok and from what I saw, it looked like it was gonna be rather enjoyable. I watched all of season one and a little bit of season two and I can safely say that it just is not funny to me in the slightest. I didn't even know what the jokes were supposed to be. Like are we laughing at the suicidal guy and the character pouring one out for his dead best friend? I didn't get what it was that I was supposed to find funny. Also the Brazil episode was uncomfortable to me because hearing people argue is not my idea of a good time.

This of course is all personal opinion but I just really wanted to like it more. I really like Pim, I think he's just a cute and funny little guy. I gave two stars extra just for him. Pim's great.

But yeah man, I dunno it just was so unfunny to me.",literal
"Amazing series I'm not a big Fan of the white lotus series ,but I open my mind to watch this because the big star like Lalisa. I think this series is incredible satire that can be teach us about Humanity that we have somethings inside us (Dark side) and we have to learn about it clearly and carefully. Even it just start first EP, but every characters is very interesting even the white lotus staffs though. Seem like each of them have their hidden story and it seem like dark side that they cannot hide anymore while they stay in this resort, seem like they have to explode it out.

Can't wait to see next EP and watch until the end is going to be...Who got killed and who is the murderer!!!",literal
Good movie minus Sharron Stone The movie is pretty action packed. The original cast brings another great effort. It shows the main character can be awesome without looking like they eat steroids for all three meals. Sharron Stone is terrible. Her acting seems forced and is absent of any heart. Replace her with anyone off the street and you would have a better movie.,literal
"Perfect then ruined I had read the books years before the series came out and was a bit dubious about how it would translate to the screen. I then saw HBO were doing it which eased my worries as they make some superb programmes, and when I finally got to watch it, it is superb from the first scene.

Excellent casting, acting and staying close to the books this was the best programme on TV for years!

The problem is the series overtook the books and since then it has gone downhill, especially the final series. There is a massive battle which should be incredible but I found it a real let down, and the episodes after this are even worse. These characters that have been so well developed over the years suddenly act in ways that are just bizarre, I'm incredibly disappointed, I doubt George R R Martin had much to do with the scripts/plot and I'm sure he can't be happy with the result. 10/10 for the first few seasons, 3/10 for the last one.

There were also a couple of things in the previous season which were a big letdown, like explaining where the bad guys came from, and some characters were massively underused, or their story arc just seemed to tail off when the had been so promising.

Overall definitely worth watching but prepare yourself for disappointment towards the end.",literal

"Love season 1, like season 2 The first season of the show gets a nine from me. It's tight, consistent, darkly humorous, and its social commentary is nuanced and central to the show. Season two gets more like a six. It's good enough for me to watch a season three, but overall season two is less interesting because it feels more like a slow moving trainwreck of a tabloid story. The writing is just too obvious and lacks the nuance necessary to make the excesses interesting or meaningful. That doesn't make it bad television, but it does move it to the ""maybe"" category of recommendations for me - except for Aubrey Plaza's performance. She is excellent and definitely worth showing up for. Overall, the show is engaging and has plenty to say. If they can move past the sophomore slump of overly obvious excess, I'd love to see more seasons.",figurative
Torture The movie was torture. It was one awkward scene after the next. It made me feel very uncomfortable. It was like a nightmare that I could not escape. I felt the movie was well done for the plot and acting spot on. But I would not watch again if you paid me. It's bad enough to watch the dumb criminals shows. But getting to know someone and then watching them make the dumb decisions ? It's like reliving a horrible mistake you've made in your life that you regret that you cannot change. That is what this movie is. A giant ball of regrets and awkwardness. Most upsetting was that it called itself an action. The movie was a drama primarily. Secondary it was a dark comedy. There was nothing action about it !,literal
"Good old-fashioned violent fun There's something so satisfying when the bad guys in a movie are Nazis. It's almost a bit of a cheat code to ensure that you are firmly on the side of the protagonist. Throw a dog into the mix and it's a no doubter.

This ticks a lot of boxes for my favourite things in movies. A vigilante exacting brutal revenge is just such a satisfying thing to watch on screen. Also the movie has no limits on violence which I love.

The film does require a heavy suspension of disbelief. We would have to believe that this is the most incompetent Nazi troop that ever existed. Completely unable to shoot straight at point blank range. Just how ridiculous it can be in this sense is probably the one let-down of the movie. If this doesn't bother you though you're likely to have a very good time with 'Sisu'. 8/10.",literal
"The Running Missed Oppurtunities 001 - Ben Richards, his intestines hanging out as a result of being shot in the guts before the decompression of the plane, is flying the plane directly at the network tower. Killian turns around, looks at the plane, and sees Richards, who is flipping him off. Richards' eyes are black from haemorrhaging, his grin wider than a door.

000 - Ben Richards crashes his plane into the network building. The rising resistance inspired by him is slowly taking over the country. A junkie who is near enough to the explosion to see it clearly but distant enough to survive regards it with wonder and awe. It rains fire over a radius of twenty blocks.

There are other massive missed opportunities in this adaptation, but just as was the case with The Long Walk, someone said hey, I have an ending that is so much coooooooler and decided to put that in instead. The problem being, the ending this film replaces the above with is dorkier than anything in the 1987 film, and I speak as a boy who was nine years old when that film was released when I say that even in 1987, that film was the height of dork. Oh yeah, and another problem. This ending does not merely make no sense. It is physically impossible. Or incoherent. Or just plain editorially slack. Somehow, an ejection capsule brings Richards from underneath the exploding plane all the way to the part of the tower in which the filming of the studio commentary takes place, which previous parts of the film have told us is numerous storeys above street level... I guess this film thinks we are as moronic as the depicted show likes to encourage its audience to be.

It is, of course, inevitable that a film that takes less time to watch than King says he wrote the novel in has to make some changes. Ben's progress through the audition, painfully detailed for good reason in the novel, is truncated because such details as orifice exams and ""leave your valuables"" are not important to the flow of a film and the cost-benefit in storytelling terms favours cutting them.

But what of such details as Stacey telling Ben Richards on first meeting that elder brother Bradley will, paraphrased, make Ben defecate in his boot and eat it? Sadly, nowhere to be found. This was the funniest moment in the novel simply because Ben, a big but very sickly man, is simply trying to get a little boy to not turn him in and summon the help of an elder brother who can help. That wordplay would have worked wonders in audiovisual form. As it stands, Stacey and Bradley are almost completely without a second dimension. The conversations about the network and the air pollution were amazing pieces of writing. When the real Bradley tells the real Ben, who has just watched a video of himself declaring that he is going to kill ""every pig I see"", that Bradley is surprised they let Ben get away with as much of the original speech as they did, it still brings ironic chuckles to this Child Of The 1980s. The moment when Bradley explains that the chronic coughing and shortness of breath Ben experiences is not bronchitis, but emphysema, is one of the most horrifying moments in Stephen King's writing. And this is not a horror novel we are talking about.

You see, when you are choosing what details to include, change, or omit, you always have to think about what it will cost versus what it will bring in. Adding a third runner gave us a great chance for a character to explain to the audience that for one, there are three kinds of contestant the network specifically looks for and two, one of those types is an idiot who will get killed quickly. It is all about manipulating the emotional responses of the audience, we learn. But then for reasons best known to Edgar, we are told that the person who ""came the closest"" to surviving the thirty days was done in on day twenty-nine, and later we learn that this person is McCone, the chief Hunter in this run.

McCone was described in passing as a little man. A frightening little man, but yeah. From the perspective of a six foot two Richards, the average-height man of the early 1980s would look little. That is not the problem here. Physical size comes second to ability to play the part well. The real problem is that we are given no build-up or substantial reason to care about this detail. This is not a Terminator style conflict between a protector and a hunter, it is a man versus world thing. And the real response that Killian gives in response to the world starting to turn in Richards' favour is, although a little overused in today's market, still a nihilistic joy.

No, the Hunters did not go and kill Richards' wife and child. And they were killed for realsies. Killian is not a stupid man. He knows that Richards could go stomping around the streets of the slum district and find out exactly who broke into his home in a matter of hours. It is just an unhappy accident that someone desperate enough or drugged up enough stormed the apartment and stabbed Richards' family to death. Killian even tries to sell the idea of becoming the new chief Hunter by saying it will give Richards the tools to mercilessly hunt down the perps. And McCone's protests? ""I think it is time to remember who pays your salary, Mister Chief Hunter."" Can you imagine Josh Brolin delivering that line? I can, and it angers me, what they decided to put in this film in its place. The way this plays out in the novel is a little more grown-up (no such thing as truly grown-up in the English-speaking film market anymore). Killian reminds Richards of his stated plan to come to the Network's tower and ride the elevator up, gunning down everyone on every floor. Then Killian asks if it would surprise Richards to learn that one of the people he found on the tower floors was Killian. Richards' response that he had Killian figured for the mouse rigger (goo-goo gaa-gaa, Sundar) gets Killian laughing and describing Richards as a rare, iridescent bird.

These dialogues demonstrate that the reason Richards was picked was because he was too smart to be left to potentially start building a movement on the streets and should be eliminated in the style of the game show. What they did not count on was his game show performance causing a disorganised but even larger resistance movement that at the time of the novel's end is starting to coalesce from riots into organised attacks and hood organisations. Whether this movement achieves its goals after the destruction of the Network building is never elaborated on in the novel. But the novel is replete with truly amazing exchanges of dialogues because for one, Stephen King knows how intelligent people speak and two, he knows how to structure that into an interesting scene. Two things that this film lacks in ample quantities.

The 1987 film had smarter dialogue. I never cared for Killian In Name Only calling Richards In Name Only ""cutie-pie"". But Richards In Name Only saying I have seen you before, you are the rear opening on TV before Killian In Name Only responding with that is funny, I was going to say the same thing about you, that is far closer to King-level writing than this turgid effort. Oh, and another note about the altered tapes. During the tape Richards sends after learning about the deliberate pollution of the underclass lands, when the audio is edited with the intent of turning him into a psychopath in the eyes of the audience, no effort is even made to match the voices with the lips. I do not remember in enough detail, but it is possible, even likely, that King wrote of the soundalike being slightly off, too. The novel was not just a comment on deliberately induced desperation, it was also about how easily television can be used to alter the perception of the people watching it. You know, like it has been proudly doing for around seventy-five years now?

Another commenter has also stated that the world in the film feels rather two-dimensional. This is why pieces like the defecate in your boot and eat it dialogue were so important. They also mention that Bradley Throckmorton is a big banana in the gang that controls these streets. Stacey's words to this effect come across as the terrified plays of a child that has just been seized by a big man who has climbed out of the sewer covered in shit. But when Bradley appears and his connections are verified as true, it gives a sense that there are other people than those in the narrative, behind the scenes, doing things. Bradley's words about the deliberate pollution are also executed a good deal better. He describes how a lot of his information is only available in libraries, and he explains how he and his gang get around the minimum income restriction that the Network has placed on libraries. He describes having figured out how to make a crude radioactive particle per air volume meter from these books. He describes how the readings on a good day are really bad. All of this makes the world of the novel feel alive. What do we get instead? Oh, apparently Bradley is a YouChoob star.

Did nobody in the writing room ever stop to think about how a world like the one in this novel would have scuttled the internet and censored all mention that it ever existed? How the broadcast signal would be utterly impossible to crack, and how real street gangs would distribute information through ink and paper? Did anyone put half as much thought into this film as I have during this review?

On the plus side, the first four fifths of the film are good, notwithstanding the two-dimensionality and the idiotic alterations in detail where the original material would hit a lot harder if done well. The acting is almost all great. The photography is great when we are not in an action scene. Aside from this, learn from my mistake. Save your money, do not bother. Insulting ends ruin decent adaptations.",figurative
"It's a Family Affair Greetings again from the darkness.  Check out the number of ""Howard"" surnames listed in the credits.  I counted four, but may have missed some. Dedicating the film to his recently deceased mother, Ron Howard was the perfect choice for directing this Dr. Seuss adaptation.  Mr. Howard has a real feel for family relationships and that plays a key part in the theme of the Grinch vs. Who-ville.  Howard, as usual, cast numerous members of his own family in the film.  This includes, the always good for a laugh, brother Clint.  Jim Carrey again proves that he is a tremendous acting talent.  ""The Truman Show"" followed by ""Man on the Moon"" and now this!  We are are blessed to watch such a uniquely talented performer perfect his craft.  If you say the Grinch role required little acting, you are wrong.  Carrey captures the true spirit of the role, and a wide range of emotions, while toting make-up that makes it impossible to recognize him.  My one complaint with the film is the extremely weak version of the Grinch theme song.  Done wonderfully creepy in the original TV special, the song is so light-hearted in the film that it loses the punch it is supposed to pack.  My tidbit on this one is to be sure and catch the Ron Howard parody performed by Jim Carrey as he doffs a ball cap and begins mimmicing the director.  This was most assuredly a Carrey ad lib that made the final cut.  My request of Jim Carrey is: PLEASE get over the butt fetish!",literal
"McClarnon Zahn McClarnon deserves every accolade and recognition for his role here. He carries the show...I have always admired and appreciated his acting, but, wow, he is simply exceptional in this series...And the acting that every single character delivers nails it.

Joe Leaphorn is an important character (McClarnon) who represents the Native American experience on a granular, day to day level. This takes place in the 1970's, and I learned a lot about what they experienced back then. Not that I'll ever really know it really, of course, but wow, this really expanded my glimpse into how much the disparity was back then and now. It's also a very well-scripted and crafted story arc of venality and the craven assumption of entitled power. This, imo, is one of the Best examples of dramatic social commentary AND writing and acting.",literal

"The best King adaptation of the year (which isn't saying much) There are different approaches and styles of storytelling but I have always thought that bestselling novelist Stephen King has a good grip over the most effective one of them. He has the image of horror master but his stories offer actually much more than quick thrills. You possibly couldn't churn out up to 1100 page opuses based on just thrills, could you? King's focus is always on careful character and world building because why would one want to just follow a bunch of events if one didn't care about the people in the story and what's happening to them. And he's usually scarily efficient at creating characters that we want to form emotional connections to. I have read most of King's 57 novels by now, and I am often hooked already on the first page, or maybe the second. The careful character and world building doesn't just happen at once, it takes time and room. This is one of the main reasons why most of King's adaptations are not great ones. There is no way to compress hundreds of pages into a screen story lasting about two hours. Take IT"", for example. In an original novel, there's more than 1100 pages. As a movie, it runs 135 minutes, including end credits. There was never gonna be a chance to see more than main events on screen, not to mention Hollywood's nasty way of often taking a famed literary work of fiction and throwing out almost everything but the main plot points and character names. I read IT"" more than ten years ago, so I don't remember it all that well, but the movie version feels... right. They have taken the best of both worlds: sweet nostalgia-tinged coming of age story as a backbone and the horrors served in short intervals aside. Both aspects work well, neither feels fresh but they are effective. Coming of age story resembles 1986's Stand by Me"", one of the most acclaimed King adaptation of all time. Horrors are created the cheap way, that is to say, mostly by editing and sudden creepy music or sound effects. Nothing essentially wrong with that, most horror movies do the same and they still have plenty of fans. I myself have quite tired of this and would have preferred slow and creepy building of suspense – this would have fit more closely with King's original work too – but whatever. The problem me is that there's just too many horror"" moments, after one hour it's starting to feel like a carnival show. One has to be a true horror fan to not feel exhaustion before the end, or possibly reaching the middle of the story. Two-plus hours is a long way to watch somebody attacked over and over again by the same two or three evil creatures. I mean, I like Pennywise and his crew as much as anybody but there's only so much times it feels cool to see some monster suddenly jump out from somewhere and say ""boo"". I was quite curious about how the adaptation would solve"" this famous sex scene from the original novel. There's probably no tasteful way to offer it in mainstream movie, so they have opted to not use it all. Wise choice. King should have left it out in the book, too. So. For a horror movie, IT"" is good enough if overly ready to use the same couple of tricks over and over again. For a movie inspired by King's work, it's also good enough, giving you the simple but clear taste of what the bestselling master is possibly about. For a King adaptation, it's mediocre as most of them, setting the bar too low to start with. So, you just have to go catch it and see whether you'll float too. There's a possibility of part two although it's hard to tell how concrete this is. Probably depends on the box office success. The movie ends the same way as the novel, which means there The young actors in part 1 are good, by the way.",figurative
Phenomenal storytelling I watch this and I'm reminded how incredible Jeremy Renner is as an actor. He steals every scene with brutal realism and delivers with a man who makes deals and makes sure there's peace between the police and the criminals no matter how dangerous it gets for him. You can see he wishes his brother is alive so he wouldn't be dealing with the chaos around him but chaos finds him and he fights back like a mad dog. I'm instantly addicted bc having Dianne Wiest as his mother is brilliant showing she hates what her sons have done for themselves and what it brings to her. I say watch Renner and enjoy.,literal
"A powerful adaptation of Mary Shelley's gothic epic Watched at the 2025 Toronto International Film Festival.

Guillermo del Toro's adaptation of Frankenstein is one of the best adaptations of Mary Shelley's epic novel in a very long time. Del Toro continues to prove his talents with how he directs gothic, romantic, fantasy, and emotional stories with such awe striking fierce and power within his talents. Throughout, Del Toro's direction on the writing, atmosphere, and production designs are wonderful. He maintains the balance between the themes, the tone, the style and atmosphere perfectly, which helps blend the gothic, horror, and dramatic elements together very well.

With the gorgeous camerawork, the production, colors, effects, make-up, and sound designs are wonderful. Capturing it's time period and setting in the right spot. Narrative-wise, the writing does justice to the original novel with the themes explored being portrayed throughly and meaningfully. Including some addition new themes Del Toro explored which I thought was creative. The performances from the cast are all fantastic. Oscar Isaac as Dr. Frankenstein was great as he had some much energy and charm to his character, alongside with Christoph Waltz, Mia Goth and the others. Jacob Elordi has Frankenstein the Monster, might just has given his best performance in his career thus far. Being able to capture the emotional and terrifying weight of the character of the monster himself.

Alongside with the beautiful score and some of the thrilling sequences, the movie does suffer a few pacing issues as through it's second act, it does seem to lose a little of it's steam. But overall, Del Toro does justice to a classic novel and remains as one of the best working directors in our current times.",literal
"Funny and Charming With Heavy Themes Good Fortune is funny, charming, but heavy with its themes.

The writing is great. The characters are all very likeable and no matter how much money one has, they can relate to all of them in one way or another. This script doesn't want to hide its themes. The film is heavily anti-capitalist or at least it heavily criticizes it. Usually I hate when movies preach, but it totally worked here, because this film is a very funny comedy. To be exact, the first half is very slow, but the back half is just utter fun.

As I said the first half is slow and also messy. I wasn't fan of the way the little time jumps occured and the way they were edited. I think some of those scenes could've been cut. They tried to edit them like a slow montage, but on the one hand they slowed the movie down and on the other hand the editing was too fast there and there was no comedic timing. The cinematography is great though. The camera movement is restrained, but the angles and the lighting are awesome. The production design and the acting performances are great too, while the soundtrack is awesome.

Good Fortune is a great comedy with heavy themes that rather elevate the comedy than ruin it.",literal
"Passable/predictable This version of the Fantastic Four checks all the boxes, and has some inspirational parts, but 100% plays out as expected. There aren't any surprises. Every turn of the story is foreshadowed if you're paying attention.

So it's passable for casual viewing. You'll probably appreciate the visual design and the music, and you may enjoy the acting despite its pervasive flatness.

Ultimately the best part was the depiction of old-fashioned values, when times were simpler. The idealists among us will find that refreshing.",literal
"Great so far. But what's going on with the music? It seems really well done so far, very enjoyable. But then you ended up having some very disjointing modern music dropped in over a dramatic moment. It just completely pulls you out of the story. You can't go from a modern beat in a fight to organ music and singing hymns without it just feeling out of place and....odd.",literal
An awful piece of movie!!! This movie is one of the most awful movies I have ever seen. I cannot understand how it is possible that it could get this high ranking. The actors are miserable and the plot is a farce. If it is based on a true story this fairy tale would be more credible. Sorry but this is my opinion!,literal
"Very Good Adrenaline! The first film was darker and more suspenseful. While this film leaned too far toward comedy, the action scenes were still enjoyable to watch. The camera angles during the fight scenes were excellent and kept me glued to my seat. Despite being a comedy, this film delivers the action you're looking for. This time, we had a more manic and entertaining Hutch. Grandpa's involvement in the action and the final action scenes at the amusement park were incredible. My only complaint about this film was that the action was too fast-paced; there was constant action on the screen. This film could have been a bit longer.

In conclusion:

While not as good as the first film, I thoroughly enjoyed it. This film delivers the action you're looking for.",literal
Just amazing! This is show is one of the best shows ever. The last season is just amazing and I love it!! I hope that there wil be more seasons to watch in future. Also Joseph Quinn character in the show was amazing.,literal
"Liam Neeson always delivers A rancher(Liam Neeson) who did two tours in nam, gets more than he bargained more, when he becomes a protector to a young boy, whom is being hunted by the cartel. So he must drive the boy to Chicago to be with family, and to keep from being found by the cartel.







Liam Neeson gives a terrific performance, showing he is good but very flawed, very relatable. Suspence scenes really get you watching and on the edge of your seat. The bad guys are also watchable, pretty menacing. Also has heartwarming moments.",literal
"Could have been better Ron Howard generally doesn't disappoint me, but I think he cut too much out of this movie in the editing room then he should have.  There were people leaving the theatre asking themselves why didn't they have more scenes with the Grinch and his gadgets?  That is exactly my question, if he had allowed for another 15-20 minutes of the Grinch stealing presents this movie would have been that much better.  I guess I'll have to wait for the directors cut as always.  A decent kids movie for the holidays though.",literal
"Probably most consistent TV Shows ever Both, original Law and Order and SVU are for me the most consistent on quality level...of course it all has to do with pretty similar set up in every episode in terms of plot construction but still - you can watch 200- 300 episodes without feeling that show drop on quality level too much. And this fact is very important when you consider those shows with super first seasons but very cheap last ones or late (good example is Dexter or Lost)...writers and actors just stick to their routine throuought all those years and you can enjoy ""down the Earth"" cop show. Unlike ""cool cops"" in all the CSI, this is performed the way I really believe this is how real police work can look. Best characters in my opinion from both shows - Ben Stone, Jack Mckoy, Lennie Briscoe and John Munch.",literal

"K-Pop: Demon Hunters K-Pop: Demon Hunters is one of those films that tries to merge two worlds you wouldn't normally expect to collide - the glitzy, colorful universe of K-Pop idols and the dark, monster-slaying action of a supernatural thriller. On paper, it sounds like a wild idea, but surprisingly, it manages to pull off something fun, stylish, and very different from the usual action fantasy flicks.

The movie follows a group of K-Pop stars who double as demon hunters when the stage lights go down. It blends high-energy musical performances with fight sequences, giving it a very distinct personality. Imagine John Wick meets Blackpink: The Movie - but with a supernatural twist.

What works really well here is the visual style. The film is packed with neon-lit sets, flashy costumes, and choreography that feels like a music video but still ties into the action. The fight scenes are well-shot and surprisingly creative, with the idols using not just weapons but dance-inspired moves to battle demons.

On the flip side, the story isn't groundbreaking. It sticks to a fairly straightforward good-vs-evil formula, and at times it feels like the plot is just a vehicle to string together the flashy set pieces. That said, the charm of the cast and the energy they bring make up for it.

Another highlight is the soundtrack. If you're into K-Pop, you'll love how the music is seamlessly integrated into the action. It's loud, catchy, and adds an extra layer of excitement to the fights.",literal
"Mixed Feelings From A Real-Life Firefighter-EMT I am a firefighter-EMT on the west coast, and wasn't sure about this show going in. 

My first thoughts were, ""It can't be any worse than 'Backdraft',"" and, ""Please God, let this be better than 'Rescue Me'.""

It's nice to see a show that doesn't make us all out to be lying, cheating, philandering d-bags the way ""Rescue Me"" did (although that show could always make me feel better about my own life...). This is not to say its characters are paragons of perfect virtue, but it does at least show them as worthy of the public's trust.

The station environment is semi-realistic. Of course, messing with the Probie/Candidate/New Hire/FNG/Boot is a time-honored tradition and rite of passage that all of us endured when we were new. However, the co-ed locker room is a stretch. Yes, we often share the same barracks with females, but we don't strip down for the shower in full view of the opposite sex. Just doesn't happen. Also, ""incidents"" like LT Severide sneaking into the gear room for a quickie with ANYBODY would result in serious disciplinary action.

The cast seems mostly believable to me. Eamonn Walker feels exactly like many chiefs I have known. Both LTs seem a bit young to be company officers, especially in a department like Chicago, but stranger things have been known to happen. The crews feel real enough.

The subplot that has LT Severide getting morphine from one of the medics is ridiculous. Every medication on an ALS ambulance is tracked, and the potentially addictive ones like morphine are watched like a hawk. They WOULD get caught, they WOULD get fired, and they WOULD do prison time for that.

As for the incidents, I am disappointed. The ""medics"" can't even perform basic C-spine immobilization for starters. I almost threw up in my mouth during the pilot episode when Dawson tells the little girl in the back of the wrecked car with head trauma and obvious mechanism of injury to turn her head. Any EMT student can tell you that YOU NEVER EVER DO THAT!!! I understand it's Hollywood, but come on, it's not that hard to show it done the right way. I'm a guy who has crawled inside a lot of mangled cars to pull people out; I know whereof I speak.

Many of the operations performed on incidents in the show are real, or at least close to it. Some people have criticized the ""slide down the charged line"" stunt. That is actually taught as a way to bail out from an upper-story window if you get trapped upstairs. I'm not so sure about suspending it from the truck's aerial the way they did it in the show. I'm an engine firefighter, and my truckie friends haven't gotten back to me on that one yet. However, I could think of at least two or three better ways to access that collapsed floor section. Some have also criticized the scene with LT Severide visiting the victim's widow to bring her his last words. I have had to comfort more new widows, orphans, and grieving parents than I care to think about, and it has kept me up at night. I don't carry my Iphone around in my turnout coat pocket, but this one is still perfectly plausible.

The third episode featured an overturned SUV teetering on a guardrail above a tunnel entrance with occupants trapped inside. I have experience with this type of incident (mine was on a steep hillside with the vehicle balanced on a rock). The stabilization methods they used on it would not have worked. Stabilization struts support an overturned vehicle, they don't hold it down, and placing cribbing on the guardrail would have done nothing useful that I can see. Then again, at least they sort of C-spined the kid from that wreck.

I'm unimpressed with the fire scenes so far. I've been inside lots of burning buildings. Most of the time, you're snake-crawling on the floor and you can't see your hand in front of your face. Multi-story apartment buildings with open stairwells can be a little different if the fire is on an upper floor, but not if you have fire established in the basement. If you take off your BA mask, you're probably going to die very quickly. If you stand straight up for more than a few seconds, your gear is going to fail and you're going to be in serious trouble. And while they did do most of the Pittsburg drill correctly to pull a downed firefighter out of the basement after the floor collapsed, they kinda forgot to pull out the other two guys who were down there, which is to say they only did part of the real operation. Also, they are way too clean. When you come out of a structure fire, you gear is filthy and so are you. You clean it when you get back to the station. So why do these guys come out looking like their turnouts just got dry-cleaned? I will give them this, they seem to be getting a little better in realism with each episode. I'm going to try to give this show a chance, as I think it's got some potential, though it certainly doesn't live up to ""Emergency!"", which to this day remains probably the most realistic Hollywood production about firefighters ever made.

If there's one thing I really hate about this show, it's the fact that after every episode I have to calm my fiancée down and convince her all over again that I'm not really cheating death twelve times a day. They do try to overdramatize the job. I get that, as I can attest to the fact that it's a lot more boring in real life (isn't everything?) and nobody would be that interested in a real day on the job, so I'm trying not to hold that against them.",figurative
"I'm not a shipper , I'm only an old loyal spn fan, I loved team free will with all my being and Wanted to see them happy.

(I have no problem with shipping, it's just not my thing) So, the writers spent the whole season saying that Chuck's ending was all kind of wrong and bad, they are the ones who gave me hope for a happy ending for our boys and they took it from me, from us, in the most cruel and vicious way.

The final two episodes really left me convinced that the network hates spn fans, more precisely the 70% who the hopeless and traumatizing finale left devastated.

Because as the show runner himself said: the ending was meant to please only 30% of the audience, and that's exactly what happened.

So thanks c*w for ruining my comfort show, I will never be able to watch it ever again knowing how awful the ending is.

For this, I will show you my gratitude by never watching any of your shows ever again, and same goes for Dabb.",literal
"Season 2 was fantastic! These are not knee-slapper types of jokes, but the show is...an intense, cringey-comedy whose tendrilling plot lines are getting more knotted by the minute!

Like everyone else mentioned, it isn't for everyone, but it's very, very clever!

Season One was so tense & uncomfortable & they tortuously dragged it out-ugh!! Well done!

Season Two was just superb! There were so many different dynamics yet the focus stayed with the main characters. I loved the 2 couples & the 3 generational males.

I felt like it wasn't enough-I totally wanted more. My guess is that we'll meet a few of these characters again in another season.

Great show, great writing, great characters & great acting!!",literal
"Outstanding Spook series Gary Oldman is brilliant in everything he does and he shines in this series about an outcast bunch of spooks working in a derelict building in London.

The storylines are great, with a deep, unpredictable, twisting plot filmed well and acted well by everyone.

The story covers an infrequently covered topic - MI5 and their shenanigans, more often than not putting internal politics ahead of the health and safety of the British public.

Locations are lovely as well: beautiful hotels, houses, corporate meeting rooms, lovely Cotswold villages as well as seedy restaurants and office buildings.

This is classic British TV with a feast of a plot and a light tasting of car chases, special effects and sex, rather than the reverse typically exported from across the Pond.",figurative
"good, potential for great the CSI-ish stuff is solid and intriguing and the acting is good. There are some very nice relationships developing between the team, especially Gideon and Reid (there's a hint of father/ son vibe between them that plays very nicely). 

Particularly interesting is the character of Reid and how he's slowly growing out of his shell (combination of slight autism and general ""I grew up as a freak"" syndrome perhaps). 

but there is one gripe that I have. Why is it that the only one of them with a life that we ever see is Hotch. No I'm not saying that Hotch and Morgan should drag Reid to a strip club or to get drunk at a bar. but it would be nice to get a few personal details about these folks. Learn what makes them tick. 

that said, I'm enjoying the show and certainly want to see it remain on for a very long time.",literal
"I wanted to be amazed I loved the first film, and liked the idea of the second film, I felt it started out great but seemed to borrow a little from a nightmare on elm street, and I just thought it got a little corny how they ""knew"" finding the 3 bodies would weaken him.. I think they coulda done a lot better.

Acting was good enough. It's worth a watch but another sequel that can't hold a torch to the original.",literal
"If GoT Were in the Modern West! Finally, a Western we've been waiting for! A wild, well-written Western, with all the intrigue and political/ nepotistic backstabbing of Game of Thrones!   - That should be enough to grab your attention!",literal
"After a slow start, it's gotten better. I'm glad I gave it a chance May 2025: I just changed my rating from a 7 to a 4. Season 2 is just horrible: far-fetched plots that aren't anything like the original season. We had really gotten to like Tracker last year but are so disappointed in season 2 that we are likely go to stop watching. They clearly changed writers and for the worse. They should go back to their original writers and stick with interesting plots about actually tracking people down, not over-acted, over-produced over-dramatic plots. It's really too bad.

April 2024: I just changed my rating from a 4 to a 7. The show has gotten better all around. Definitely give it a try.

Original Review (before update above) I really wanted to like this new show and was eager to see it. After watching the first episode, however, I am extremely disappointed. It's just terrible. I don't think it's Justin Hartley but everything else about it: the other characters (all predictable, all caricatures, some terribly acted), and the plot (again, predictable and trite). Some other viewers have suggested Justin Hartley's acting is stiff and bad. I don't think so; in fact, I think he's pretty good in this. But that can't compensate for the banal script and terrible plot. I might give it one more try and watch the second episode, but if it isn't exponentially better, I'm giving up.",literal
"Underwhelming Sadly Bugonia was not what I expected according to the online acclaim. Neighter was the theme; are we dealing with aliens or not? It has been done better many times before, for instance K-Pax, a great movie which dives deep into a possible alien human.

The Bugonia actors did a great job, but it's the plot that is a let down. It's way too simple and boring. Most parts take place in a basement. And that's about it, and that has also been done way too many imes before. I already wondered what Emma Stone can come up with as a producer. She is a very succesful acress but that is by no means a guarantee for quality when she interferes with movie decisions. Just like Margot Robbie with Barbie, highly succesful, but the same category, the overhyped meh stinker.",literal
"Still a great movie This is a classic film that people will still find entertaining even over 30 years later. It tells the story of Scottie Smalls who hsas just moved San Fernando Valley in 1962. He has no friends and one day finds a bunch of boys just playing baseball one day and eventually befriends them through a boy who lives close to them named Benny who is the best player on the team. The problem is Scottie is not a good ball player and through practice eventually becomes good, though his knowledge of baseball could be better. The firest part of the movie is him hanging out with these boys, becoming good friends and getting in trouble such as faking a drowning so one of them could kiss the lifeguard. About an hour in the main plot of the movie comes to fruition which is the retrieval of a baseball signed by Babe Ruth, which was Scotties stepfathers not realizing the value of it. For the last part it focuses on the boys attempt to retrieve this ball from the backyard of someone with a scary dog nicknamed the beast and a fear of the man who lives there. Those scenes are very funny. Some of the humor hasn't aged well such as the famous line you play like a girl, which is used in a negative way. There isn't alot that is inappropraite for kids, mainly some swearing but that's it. If your a baseball fan you will most likely enjoy this film.",literal
"FANTASTIC!!!! This story was so well told & constructed! Genuinely, it was so warm and full of love. I didn't expect it to be as sweet as it was. Ted really embodies this character, and there is great chemistry between almost every single actor. The story touches on some deep topics, but leaves you with a hopeful outlook. I believe the general message of this show was well told & implemented too. Each episode builds well upon the last, all coming together with a great ending and creatively done as well. Most streaming shows I watch anymore aren't worth half my attention, but this had me smiling. Great job to the entire team here.",literal
"Would Recommend I've been recommended this movie by multiple people, so I thought I should check it out. With a killer soundtrack and an exciting storyline, I think this movie is a good one for the whole family to enjoy! I loved the animation style and the humorous lines added in to bring up the mood. I appreciate that they brought in industry professionals to sing some of the songs in order to connect the movie to real life audiences.

I would have preferred more interesting dialogue at parts, but not disappointed with how it turned out. Although it definitely targets kids and k-pop fans, I think anyone can have a great time watching it.",literal
"Amazing true story movie I've always been a fan of ""based on a true story"" movies, but not all are hits, mostly misses. But this one is a huge hit, specifically due to Channing Tatum's outstanding performance. Additionally, usually these ""based on a true story"" movies are only patially produced from actual facts, however after checking up on the actual events from the real Jeffrey Manchester, this portrayal is pretty much bang on. It was well directed and had the perfect amount of drama and comedy, and all cast and performances were excellent. A well deserved 8/10 from me.",figurative
"A must watch! I'm going to do a joint review since I watched both the film ""Policeman"" and the TV series ""The Diplomat."" While my experience with ""Policeman"" was less than satisfactory, ""The Diplomat,"" starring Keri Russell, was nothing short of fantastic. I found it to be one of the best portrayals of the political landscape, focusing on a character who is reluctant to be in the spotlight yet finds herself entrenched in it. Keri Russell delivers an outstanding performance in the first season, drawing viewers in and providing a deep understanding of the complexities of politics-how it should ideally function and the messy reality of it all. Her character embarks on a compelling journey, and the storytelling is truly remarkable. Season 2 takes things to another level, offering even more excitement and intensity. The plotlines involving the Prime Minister and various political machinations are expertly crafted and engaging. The cast, including the supporting actors and actresses, is exceptional, adding depth to the series. The subplot with the vice president is particularly noteworthy, elevating the intrigue even further. By the end of Season 2, you'll find yourself eagerly anticipating Season 3. I wholeheartedly recommend checking out this series; it's a must-watch!",figurative
"Nobody wants this Nobody wants this series series 2024 is delightful two unlikely individuals United,the tension between these two and their performances is beyond measures,this series is about finding someone when you least expect it this series is one of the best. The chemistry between Kristen Bell and Adam Brody was good .l love how they tangled their family connections it shows their relationship with their families was so important to them and they respected it from all angles. Overall the story flowed perfectly well and the characters worked through all issues with their families. A charmy comedy well written and great performance, l would so recommend the whole world to watch it.",literal
"Great series, one of the best It was apparent from the start that we were seeing the very worst of men and their best, though less of the later. Every conceivable weakness of man was shown by the Warleggens and its amazing that all these years later, rabble like he still run our countries and industry. The show tells us how unkind men are to each other, how the rich are so full of arrogance and entitlement and nothing has changed today. Watching this makes you want to revolt and change our society but as the show explains all to well those few with the power keep us all beneath them, working for unfair wages and totally slaved to their ways. Nothings changed.

I recommend the show highly it was great entertainment in addition to a great example of history and how the rich classes did everything in their power to keep the poor, poverty stricken.

The acting was great, the settings were beautiful and while I was angry with not seeing Warleggens head cut off, it was nearly sufficient seeing him endure the traumas he did lol.

Great Flick, you've got to see it!!",figurative
"Hilarious! As someone who has a career in HR but has a sense of humor, this show is absolutely hilarious!

The amount of ""HR violations"" in each episode just makes me laugh so hard! All of them are legit violations but the best part is not that they're funny (and we all need to laugh more,) but that whoever is committing the violation isn't intending to do that for the most part.

The pranks Jim pulls on Dwight, anything and everything Michael tries to do, Stanley's lack of emotion except on pretzel day, the build up between Jim/Pam and Dwight/Angela, and then just the rest of the cast! Getting Michael back for Dwight's wedding was an awesome surprise and I always liked how they had some nice human situations in the show.

Great run and love having it on.",literal
"Loving the Look Back My initial take on this was the show is a little slow for an NCIS spinoff. Also, the characters felt too unfamiliar, especially the departure from Gibbs both physically and emotionally. However, after a few episodes, and hearing Gibbs brooding voice, it reminded me of which version of Gibbs we're supposed to be watching. While Franks is just a younger who we knew, this younger, lost Gibbs felt unfamiliar. My bias was clouding the issue. The tone and pace of the show are nothing like the original. This is no simple retread. It feels new and original despite including characters we're all too familiar with. This deep dive into the history of NCIS shows us a vulnerable (despite his size) Gibbs rebuilding himself after the tragedy that reshaped his life. This feels credible. It feels believable. It's emotional and painful. I don't anticipate too many light moments considering where they started and where Gibbs always ends up...always alone and angry.

They're leaning into the time period. Anyone that remembers the early 90s will enjoy this trip down memory lane.

The other characters fill in well providing just enough to lighten the mood a little but not taking away from the overall seriousness and weight of the subject matter. It never feels like too much. The coroners and forensics teams offer a small change of pace.

I cannot tell where this going. And that is another bright spot. Considering we know where this goes, how we'll get there doesn't feel very predictable. We'll see.",literal
"Loved the ending, unconditional love. Wow, i wasn't sure if i really wanted to watch this. Its the bond between the two brothaz that spiked my interest. I liked how tony said he's addicted to his brotha. That was powerful. I liked how he always knew the truth. Replied to his big brotha saying why did you not talk to me. That was a hella of secret to bear for them both. I even liked the deaf guy, he just held jack feelini his pain. How the big brotha in the end knew what he had to do for everyone to be ol'rite. In the end he wasn't a selfish perk. He was actually matured of circumstance, grounded in his desire to be betta, do betta for himself, his daughta n' i felt that was just wondaful. The loyalty between both the brothaz was touching. It was truly the best part of the entire creation. A brothaz love.....would totally watch it again.",literal
"S1 and S2 10 GOLD stars Oh my goodness! Season 1 ended on a cliffhanger with of gigantic proportions. Season 2 had me almost in a heart attack in the closing few minutes of Season 2.

I do not know if my heart can take a Season 3.

I initially thought this was a lo key, slow burn political drama. Maybe another kind of *feel good* tv drama like Madame Secretary.

Boy, was I wrong. The Diplomat will have you on the edge of your seat each episode. Binge watching them like a starved animal.

This is political theatre at its very finest. It's even more cut throat than my wildest dreams.

And, even if it's only 1 tenth true of what REALLY happens in USA politics and the various agencies (CIA, Secret Service, Diplomacy) it is still a wild ride.

Keri Russell is once again in a strong female protagonist role that reminded me why I loved her performance so much in ""The Americans"" She is outstanding!",figurative
"It's just another bad apple What should I say?

I can't see into the future, but after two episodes I can already tell that this series is going to be bad.

The cliffhanger at the end of the second episode is completely unnecessary. That kind of thing shouldn't happen with a budget like this. What were they thinking? Didn't they know that Apple always releases a preview for the next episode? That's the point where you should stop watching the series. It's a red flag.

Apart from that, there are other reasons for my poor rating. The series starts off weak, illogical, and chaotic. By the end of the first episode, you already feel the frustration that you're only supposed to feel at the end of a series.

The plot and characters are a complete mess. I can already guess where the show is heading, but it could have been executed so much better.",literal
"A Refreshing Christmas Tale Big budget remake of the classic cartoon about a creature (Jim Carrey) intent on stealing Christmas.

I had rather low expectations for this one... not sure why, as it turned out to be quite good. I just wanted to add a few thoughts here.

First of all, Taylor Momsen nailed the Cindy Lou Who part. She has gone on to bigger, better things (""Gossip Girl"") and good for her. Second, Ron Howard nailed the look of a Seussian world. The faces, the architecture, it all seems so right and I think the good doctor would have approved. I heard that Tim Burton was approached to direct, and I think he would have done a fine job, but how do you beat this? 

And last, Jim Carrey. Wow. He has had some good and bad career decisions, and this has to be among his best. The physical comedy, the improvised jokes, it was like the role he was born to play. The other choices were Jack Nicholson and Eddie Murphy. Nicholson could possibly have done it ten years earlier, but did he have that range of motion in 2000? And Eddie Murphy? Maybe, maybe not. This was a Carrey role inside and out.",literal
"RunningMan-pre Stephen King I read The Running Man when Richard Bachman was still Richard Bachman and before Stephen King was outed as the actual author. I thoroughly enjoyed it and the other Bachman Books as well.

I remember thinking that this would make a great movie, but it was many years before I got to see it, and I vaguely recollect a sense of disappointment at the result. So, when this popped up I was keen to see how it had aged.

Not that well. Look, it doesn't follow the book closely and has a distinct Star Trek 80's fashion and feel about it, but it's a decent enough movie and quite credible given the events the entire world went through recently.",literal
"A good bad time. Up until last year, I'd never read a Stephen King book, and now I've almost got through them all. The Long Walk came after The Stand, It, and some of The Dark Tower books, but it was pretty high priority-wise, since it's one of his first-ever published stories. And so it was neat to come into this being familiar with the story, and also just curious as to how they'd translate something so miserable, violent, and one-note to the big screen.

Not one-note in a bad way. The source material is well-paced, even if it's just people walking. It felt like that wouldn't really translate super well, though, unless some changes were made, and I think I just expected them to change things up quite a lot. So it's a relief to find they didn't, and The Long Walk adaptation commits to the premise almost entirely. There are some changes, but the core is the same, with the walk starting almost straight away, diversions from the competition at hand being minimal, and the whole thing just moving forward continually.

They didn't shy away from that grueling repetition, nor the savageness of the book, and I appreciated that. This is directed by the guy who did all but one of the Hunger Games movies, so I half-assumed they'd water down The Long Walk, or make it teen-friendly, and they really didn't. It ends up being engrossing in the same ways the source material was. There are also some eye-catching shots here, and most of the performances are good (Judy Greer lays it on a bit thick). Some of the abrupt violence is effective, especially the first properly shocking thing that happens, but there's a brief flashback where the abruptness of a violent act felt a bit comical... but the non-walk stuff is kept to a real minimum.

It's a very good movie. It's not a fun time, but it's engrossing and well-made, and it had to be kinda the opposite of fun to be an effective adaptation.",literal
"Treat it as a sitcom, not a mockumentary. American TV shows simply cannot do reality, or even pretend reality like the British version. You genuinely could have believed the original version was a real documentary, and the production company just stumbled across a very odd collection of people and David Brent.

The American version suffers from constantly trying to be funny, rather than just being funny. The script becomes completely unbelievable and they mostly step away from the mockumentary style, and just into a sitcom. It is a good sitcom though, for sure. It's very funny, enjoyable to watch and has some great moments.

Unfortunately, as like other American series, it was successful and went on for far too long, its success was it's downfall where the script was stretched on and on to cash in on the success. I felt it naturally came to an end at the end of season 5 but they dragged it out even after Steve Carell had left. Definitely worth a watch though.",literal
"Poor film This is so bad, the story, the script, the action of which there is next to none. I have to call out anyone that gives this film a 10, if you are telling me this film can be compared to say The shawshank redemption, One flew over the cuckoos nest,The godfarther 2 etc. I would question your honesty. Watch this film if you have nothing better to do other than sleep.",literal
"It's become slow & boring Season 18 has become a drudge. The whole show is now just based on one plot - the Sicarius/Voit character, and the storyline is repetitive, dragged out, and boring.

The characters have also become dull, boring & predictable; Emily always has a pained expression like she has bad indigestion, Rossi's 'urbane suave wine lover' covering up his total boring character (the hallucinations were ridiculous), Penelope is by far the most irritating character, always in an infantile emotional crisis, and Tara has no personality and lesbian relationship adds nothing. They are all just a bunch of whiny boring nobodies.

Bring back Spencer & Hotch.",literal
"Hilarious pilot! Keep 'em comin'! Stumbled onto this little show by accident, ended up laughing my ass off throughout the pilot episode. And then when I recognized Mike Stoklasa's voice, that really sold it for me. (He's really great in this, please make Desmond a recurring character!)

The whole pilot oozes creativity and raw comedic talent, it reminded me of the first episodes of South Park. If they keep this up then I think they've really got something here, I'm really looking forward to seeing more of this!",literal
"Morality Tale That Resounds in Today's Fractured World After waiting interminably for its return to PBS/Masterpiece, Poldark does not disappoint. There are new characters, Caroline Penvenen who becomes the love interest of Dr Dwight Enys, and benefactor to Ross.

Ross and Demelza have a much stormier relationship but reconciliation with love and sensuality. However, Ross is intent on saving his mine despite the interference of George Warleggan, his arch rival and enemy. Lots of turmoil and enmity between these two. Ross and Francis reconcile, as Francis reconciles with his sister, Verity and her husband, Capt Blamey. Blamey's grown children are introduced to her.

Ross and Demelza have a son,Jeremy, despite Ross's misgivings, both emotional and financial, as they go through a rough patch with the uncertainty of mining; Demelza is delighted to be a mother once again. Ross continues his reckless yet sincere, honorable quest for mining success, along with a questionable deal to ensure they can stay solvent financially - he's a great risk taker, much to Demelza's dismay and worry. And always with his concern for the mining folk who trust him to look out for their welfare - a morality tale for today with the ""haves and have nots"", nouveau riche poseurs, moral courage in the face of poverty and loss, sickness and death. This season has much more plot action, more revealing character insight, beautifully filmed in Cornwall, itself a character in the drama.

Cast is outstanding, with handsome, talented Aidan Turner, new star - who would have thought PBS would have a new sexy leading man like this one! Eleanor Tomlinson's Demelza is a feisty foil for Ross's reckless yet caring nature. Lots of action, excellent character layering and fast paced drama. Message is timeless - a barnburner of a romantic action drama. A real winner for Aidan Turner and PBS Historical drama fans!",figurative

"So Disappointed Just plain silly. I have loved all of the Superman movies beginning with the 1978 Christopher Reeve classic, and including the 2006 Brandon Routh ""Superman Returns."" Henry Cavill's Superman movies were enjoyable even ""Batman vs Superman"" and ""Justice League."" This latest effort is a hot mess. Too many comic characters, too much disjointed stuff happening in the first half hour and too much explaining what everyone is about to do and why they are doing it. Watching Superman get beat up every 10 minutes was a bit much. I only watched it all the way to the end in the hopes it would get better. It didn't.",figurative
"Went from excellent to boring to excellent again! The first season was intriguing, fast paced, and with interesting characters. I binged it in a matter of days. I loved the dynamic amongst the main male and female characters as well as the dichotomy between the veterans and the newbie. Reese Witherspoon's innocence was captivating. Great season one finale, so naturally I was excited about season two.... The first four episodes of season 2 dragged.....but I'm glad I persevered. The second season really picked up with the 5th episode. They dealt with some difficult topics that other shows shy away from for fear of antagonizing the viewers. The Morning Show deals with them head on! Bravo!

Then, on a totally different level, I do not understand what Jennifer Aniston has done to her once beautiful face. It's not age. It's the excessive use of botox and fillers that has ruined her face. She looks perpetually swollen and startled! What's wrong with wrinkles? They're beautiful.

One caveat: If her face is swollen due to medically needed oral steroids, then I understand. Otherwise, a naturally aging face is very graceful.",figurative
"Too bad the writers won't see this I think I know what problem is. 1) The writers think American audiences are too dumb to follow along. Its annoying to have them referred to ""the livings"" to remind us that these characters are dead. Do your job. 2)I mean I just wish I could belive that the lady was actually driven mad. Instead she just sounds annoyed at best. 3) lastly all the ghosts are the same age. I think with the age diversity in the british version it genuinely felt like a sort of family and it actually feels like you're teaching this old ghost how to use the computer. Instead it's like dead friends. Not the same feeling of comradarie.",literal
"Between Love and the Need to Belong After Past Lives, the bar for Celine Song was incredibly high, and perhaps for that reason Materialists doesn't quite reach the same level of mastery. Even so, it's a remarkable film that confirms the director as one of the most compelling voices in contemporary cinema.

The story treads familiar ground: a romantic triangle, doubts about true love, and the human need not to be alone. But Song reshapes the genre with a sentimental, reflective tone that goes beyond conventional romantic comedy. It's not just about who ends up with whom, but about what it means to seek affection in a world where everything seems measured by perceived value.

The script is full of sharp dialogue, the kind that leaves you with more questions than answers. The characters, convincingly portrayed, feel real in their vulnerability and contradictions, making it easy for the audience to see themselves in them.

The central trio-Chris Evans, Pedro Pascal, and Dakota Johnson-works beautifully, giving the story balance. Johnson in particular stands out, once again proving her growing strength as an actress, bringing both sensitivity and power to her role.

Visually, the film maintains the elegance shown in Song's debut, with a restrained but carefully crafted style. The inclusion of Cat Power songs adds to the melancholic atmosphere.

In the end, Materialists may not be as flawless as Past Lives, but it has heart, ideas, and moments of genuine beauty. A film worth seeing, about love, desire, and the eternal need not to be alone.",literal
"Might work for melodrama fans but did nothing for me Bob Merrick is a spoilt, arrogant playboy who enjoys life and takes risks. When his speedboat flips at high speed he is close to death but a resuscitator is rushed to his side from the home of Dr Philips. However while it is with Merrick, Philips dies. Merrick suffers great guilt as a result of this and he tries to use his massive trust fund to make amends. Mrs Philips refuses this and Merrick sinks into self-pity. It is only a chance encounter that teaches him the idea of doing good deeds as a way of improving the world in general. When Merrick's persistence makes things worse he throws himself into a life of service with a vengeance.

Sounding a little like a melodramatic version of My Name is Earl, I came to this film having enjoyed several other Sirk melodramas and finding much to enjoy below and around the soapy, weepy plots that could have been just so much daytime TV fodder. Sadly with this film I didn't find the material that engaging, perhaps because the story is so weak (from a non-weepy type of guy's point of view). That Sirk didn't manage to make more of this film. As a result it does fall squarely into melodramatic territory (and I say that as a negative thing) because the subtext is as unsubstantial as the main plot. The story is mostly an unlikely romance that is brought about as a result of a sort of karma experience with Merrick. I didn't really get into it that much mainly because it was all so sentimental and unconvincing. Weepy fans might like it but I hazard a guess that even they may be cynical enough to have a bit of a problem with this.

Sirk's direction is as good as ever and the whole thing fits the period really well but does it without feeling dated at all. His cast are not so impressive. I've never been that taken with Rock Hudson and he falls rather flat in this turn and seemed unable to get into his character  playing it too abrupt at first and too, too, well, ""Jesus"" later on. Wyman didn't do it for me either and she also seemed to be suffering with the material she was served with. Support from Rush, Kruger and others all fit the genre but nobody really made that much of an impression on me.

So after a couple of reviews praising Sirk for raising his films above the melodramatic genre that he often worked in, I must confess to being left rather cold by this film. The plot was just too soapy, sentimental and unlikely that I found little of interest in it to compensate for all the syrup and weepy nonsense. Might work for melodrama fans but did nothing for me.",figurative
"Fear, Grief, and a Wicked Smile: A Horror Film That Shoots Straight and Twists Sideways What I loved about Weapons is how it transcends dark comedy and horror without ever sliding into that awkward ""hor-com"" territory.

Zach Cregger walks a razor-thin line, blending grim absurdity with bone-deep dread, and somehow makes the shifts feel seamless. The result is a film that's both unnerving and strangely funny, but never cheap or gimmicky.

The premise is chilling (17 children vanish at 2:17 a.m., with only one left behind) but the real horror isn't just supernatural. It's the community tearing itself apart with blame, paranoia, and grief.

Julia Garner is phenomenal as Justine, the teacher caught between guilt and suspicion; she gives the film its aching core. Josh Brolin, as a father unraveling, delivers one of his most raw performances in years, while Alden Ehrenreich, Austin Abrams, and Benedict Wong flesh out the moral gray zones with urgency and humanity.

Cinematography and editing keep the multiple perspectives sharp, slowly peeling layers back until the final act hits with both terror and sorrow. It's not flawless - a few threads feel stretched - but the ambition and execution more than outweigh the quibbles.

Weapons proves horror can be intelligent, layered, and darkly comic without losing its bite. 8.5/10.",literal
"Jeff Chandler was right about this one...but it is still worth seeing. According to IMDb, Jeff Chandler declined to star in this film as he found the script to be 'too soppy'. Well, after having seen it, I would definitely agree that this movie is a soppy soap opera...but it is also watchable in spite of this.

The film was first made back in 1935 and starred Robert Taylor and Irene Dunne. It's every bit as good as this 1950s version, though the 50s version is a bit stickier and glossier thanks to the direction of Douglas Sirk. It's a completely ridiculous story about a selfish playboy who eventually falls for a blind lady who he's wronged. Sounds confusing? See the film and see what it's all about.

The bottom line is that the actors do a fine job and the director makes about as good a version of the film as possible given the silliness and stickiness of the dialog. Not a terrible movie at all but it gets low marks for realism, that's for sure.",literal
Amazing Storyline Fantastic understory to an amazing action drama! One of my favorite movies to watch!,literal
"I'm being gaslit by the entire world I don't write reviews on IMDB as my opinions are usually within a point. However, I do think I'm being gaslit by the entire world saying this is some amazing movie. It is more an average Will Smith action movie made in 2025 but more horror/gore.

While the twin element, spiced up gore-y effects and production are nice - including a pretty cool score...even some modern metal played at one point..the rest is basically the same stuff you've seen a million times..just slightly different.

List of tropes off the top of my head:


* The anti-hero protagonist(s) against an influential Satan



* Incredibly inept comedic relief character who gets f'ed up almost immediately



* Character who is clumsy at first but acts as a crucial cog



* Character who makes a stupid decision after their spouse is in danger and creates an unnecessary climatic situation



* A large amount of bad guys get their ass kicked by a handful of normal citizens



* The main characters have tough choices to make that boil down to trust



* The logical character who keeps everyone in check but gets overruled by an idiot



* Main character has plot armor and takes on countless inept canon fodder while not even attempting to be tactical, instead looking cool for the camera


Almost nothing happens in the first hour aside from the antagonist being introduced.

I'm not a film buff by any means, but I cannot fathom this universal praise for a mid action horror movie.",literal
"One of TV's greatest show ruined... This has been a legendary show, one of television's greatest and one of my top favorites ever, portraying a raw and rugged NYC with all the shortcomings of a underfunded police department and tricky legal system, great performances, moral dilemmas, unpredictable and smart scripts and visceral characters and actors made from their roles in it. It is a real shame to see its current overstylized condition, with the production investing in beautified characters and elementary dialogues, highly predictable narrative, flat and suspense-free content and bad acting instead of keeping the original flowy feel...it just feels so fake and stuck up and if Waterston wasn't in it, it would be unwatchable...i guess it reflects the state of the city as a whole and its gentrified demise, but they could at least make it more believable...real shame.",literal
"Epic! I took a while to start watching this. Eventually I thought I would give it a try. To be honest it was a slow burner for the first couple of episodes but then I was drawn in and hooked.

It's got everything! Bar fights, politics, love, hate, tears, tantrums, family feuds, family love, good ole shoot ups, history, big mountains and big skies!

It touches all the emotions... you laugh, you cry and you get drawn in and find an empathy within this family.

It's been compared to a modern day Dallas... it's way much more than that ! It's tough and it feels real!

Best thing I have watched since the Ozarks and much much more!!",literal
"A rare misfire from Ron Howard... Director Ron Howard usually makes wonderful films; 'Apollo 13', 'A Beautiful Mind', and I even liked 'Willow'. But he seems to have taken an off day for the big-budget Dr. Seuss adaptation 'How The Grinch Stole Christmas'. 'Grinch' is a mess, drowned in special effects and gaudy production design, and it completely misses the point of the original story.

Howard does something here I would never have thought possible: He makes Jim Carrey unfunny. I am not kidding. Carrey is just NOT FUNNY. Oh, he gives it his all, milking every joke 'til it's dry, but his performance, I am unhappy to report, falls flat. It's truly depressing to see a great comic actor in a spectacularly bad role.

The overcompensating script by 'Roger Rabbit' authors Jeffrey Price and Peter Seaman doesn't help matters. It tries to 'explain' the Grinch's antisocial behavior. I admire the effort, but that's just not a good idea. The movie does have one good thing in it: Taylor Momsen, who steals the show as Cindy Lou Who. Momsen is the only actor in the movie who understands what she's doing.

Howard piles on the sap in the final act, and I groaned more than once during those last 10 minutes. Ron Howard: What happened, man? 'How The Grinch Stole Christmas' is a disaster.",figurative
"Flashy, derivative action stereotype.... First off, I think I was half-drunk when I saw this movie, and yet it still came through as another flashy, explosion derivative popcorn flick in the genre Schwarzenegger so nicely carved out for Hollywood.

Vin Diesel is a half decent actor, but I wouldn't call this movie his holy grail. In fact, any of his other movies are better than this one, simply because every other movie of his made sense. I felt this one just kind of throws both Diesel and the viewer into the action without giving us a half decent reason for him to be there in the first place. XXX's strongest redeeming element is it's mindless action - you can just turn off your brain, because you won't have to think once while watching this movie.",literal

"The masses have been unkind to this yet... What can the masses possibly know beyond what appeals to the masses or average joes?

I almost contended with the most common and substantial aspect of the material its fairly drawn out volume which if you aren't into any aspects will be a bit of a turn off a times.

Still so much of the core writing and story or excellent. Also seeing jack whitehall play a antagonist or the bad guy for me is like seeing robin williams breakout in divergent content when he did his two dark drama thriller character movies.

Just the fish out of water juxtaposition was one of the most major draws. Its not flawless in detail but largely the journey and experience is overall intelligent thoughtful and intriguing.

You can also see where many clever hoops were jumped. The careful casting of talents and names while also not spending too much or breaking the budget. The locations speak of good deals or people desperate to cover expenses and so forth. The masterful psychology of manipulation and the functional trauma displayed seem well considered and no doubt all this finery and depth overlooked by the masses.

Frankly the reviews seem even dumber than their attempts to assess the quality of the content.

One of my favorites is besides duchovny the acting is terrible. LOL i won't even delineate and explain why that is on its head heels in their air self defeating point of debate that destabilizes a premise of sound judgement.

I can't recall all those oscars and grammys duchovney won for all his high art films and acting and then to state he was the sole performer in the show on top of it.

ITs imperfect all day mind you. I was almost thrown by some choices in the usual we chop the chronology of the scenes or show it out of order to enhance the pacing feel reveals etc there were certainly two memorably jarring moments that left me rewinding to recall wtf just happened and determine the intended location changes etc with seemingly poor establishing mechanisms.

Still at its core i find the premise and believably to be just on that fine line of it could happen in some world to it could only happen on the big screen usually in the way things always end far more neatly than in real life.

Personally it seems a bit underrated to me and at the same time i can see why it doesn't have much mass appeal or praise for its surface traits or digestibility.

Its really more 6-6.5 for me but i went the half point over seeking balance based on far too many overly low ratings.

To suggest this could be sub 5 outside of personal bias is clearly ridiculous

Also a lot of class based themes are very strong and largely shown from the top side perspective which is no doubt difficult for masses to relate to but broadly much of it is clever sound and uncomfortable or cathartic.

At the same time when i saw jack and david as top cast names i knew all too well to what level to mitigate my expectations of overall production values acting quality etc.

"It's Paul Blart meets Jack Reacher. The critics hated it and rated it on 20/100 on Rotten Tomatoes. But the viewers loved it and many rated it 10/10 stars. Parents all agreed that their teenagers loved it and that it's the first film they've watched with their kids that everyone enjoyed.

It's a film that if you looked at it critically, it doesn't work. But if you relax and you let go of judgment, it's hilarious. As they roll credits, they show all the outtakes where the actors either laughed at wrong time or missed their lines. You can decide how you feel about it. 😎",literal
"A Giant Leap, But Not a Landing ""The Fantastic Four: First Steps"" is the kind of movie that's as captivating as it is shaky, all thanks to its ambition to deliver something visually and emotionally bold within the already worn-out formula of superhero films. Right from the opening scene, where Sue (Vanessa Kirby) tells Reed (Pedro Pascal) she's pregnant, the film sets a surprisingly mature and intimate tone-one that most movies in this genre wouldn't even dare to touch. Director Matt Shakman clearly makes an effort to treat his characters as actual people first, superheroes second. Pascal and Kirby don't just convince us they're a couple; they carry the emotional weight of the entire film with performances that go way beyond what superhero flicks usually offer. Their relationship anchors the story, especially when they're faced with the mythic and absolutely bonkers dilemma of having to give up their child to Galactus (Ralph Ineson), a cosmic being who wants to transfer his essence into the baby in exchange for Earth's survival. There's no shortage of mythological subtext here-we get echoes of Prometheus, defying the gods for a greater good, but also ""Hereditary"" with its unsettling look at family invasion by forces beyond their control, ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" in its questions of identity, and even ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" with tragic choices shaping an innocent's fate, though here, the tragedy leans more symbolic than literal.

That emotional weight, however, doesn't always extend to the rest of the team. Ebon Moss-Bachrach and Joseph Quinn get some solid moments as Ben Grimm and Johnny Storm, but both characters feel like victims of rushed editing, which trims out any narrative ""fat"" but also cuts off some much-needed dramatic depth. There's a hint of a romantic subplot between Ben and Natasha Lyonne's character that could've been genuinely touching-think ""Notting Hill"" or ""Before Sunrise""-but it barely gets room to breathe. Even the group dynamic, while warm and believable, takes a back seat once the central conflict kicks in. Still, Moss-Bachrach's take on The Thing is a real gem; he brings a sense of awkward vulnerability to the role that hits even when he's buried under layers of rock.

Visually, ""The Fantastic Four: First Steps"" is an absolute treat. Kasra Farahani's production design is off the charts-a retro-futuristic feast blending elements from the '40s through the '70s. It's like the film takes place in an alternate universe where analog charm never died out despite technological leaps. Old-school tube TVs, vintage soda bottles, fake movie posters, robot butlers-there's so much detail that you'll want to pause every frame just to soak in the background. Setting the story on Earth-828, outside the main MCU timeline, gives the movie room to breathe without being chained to continuity, and adds to the sense of freshness, even when what we're seeing feels familiar. Sure, the shadow of ""The Incredibles"" looms large, but considering Brad Bird himself was inspired by the original Marvel comics, the resemblance feels more like a loving homage than a lazy copy.

What really holds ""The Fantastic Four: First Steps"" back from greatness is its own rush. In trying to keep things moving, the movie glosses over emotional beats, skips through transitions, and speeds up moments that deserved time to land. This becomes especially clear in the third act. Just when everything seems to be building toward an epic climax-Galactus looming, Sue and Reed emotionally drained, the team seemingly out of options-the movie just... ends. It feels more like part one of a bigger saga than a full story on its own. The final showdown doesn't feel like a resolution-it feels like a handoff. That seriously undercuts everything that came before, as if all the tension and heartbreak were just stepping stones toward a ""to be continued."" The ending does offer a non-sacrificial solution, sure, but it leaves you with this strange sense of incompleteness-not because questions go unanswered, but because the movie deliberately refuses to give us anything final.

All in all, ""The Fantastic Four: First Steps"" manages to get right most of what its predecessors got horribly wrong, but still stumbles where it counts the most: closure. Its strength lies in the care given to its characters, its gorgeous visual world, and its honest attempt to deliver something emotional instead of just loud. It's one of those rare blockbusters that cares more about what's at stake for its heroes off the battlefield. But as a standalone story, it falls short. Maybe that was the point-to set up what's to come-but as a single piece, it lacks the punch of a real ending. That said, it's easy to root for a follow-up that finally fulfills all the potential this one only hints at.",figurative

"Interesting characters, outstanding writing and acting One of my favorite podcasters (Laura Richards from True Crime profile) gave this a rec in an episode. I'd never heard of it, and Brit productions aren't always my cup of tea, but this show is fantastic! We've loved it pretty much from the first episode. The characters are really well developed, the actors are amazing and perfectly cast (especially Jackson, Diana and Big Rod - everyone in it is great though); sometimes it is a tad predictable but not ridiculously so. It has a lot of humor, without being over the top, and unexpected plot twists. Right now it's the only thing keeping us subscribed to Apple TV - here's hoping season 4 comes out SOON! If not, we'll probably do a rewatch because the show is that good! Usually in a series there are one or two turkey episodes that are throwaways, but not here.",literal
"Sheer boredom I go into movies without watching trailers and knowing as little as possible. I did find out it's a dark comedy/thriller starring two talented actors, which was more than enough for me.

To demonstrate my experience with this movie, here is an imaginary conversation:

Me: What is this about?

Movie: Just wait!

Me: We're 40 minutes in, what is the hook? What is the intrigue?

Movie: Look how weird we are!

Me: Okay, but what is the purpose?

Movie: We're so realistic with lots of scenes of characters urinating or pleasuring themselves.

Me: Okay... but what am I even watching???

Movie: A story about a mother going through postpartum depression!

Me: Really????? That can't be it. Surely there is something more, some kind of escalation to a shocking climax.

Movie: Nah.

I'm not exaggerating, this is currently my worst movie of the year. I found it excruciatingly boring. Every scene goes on for too long. The attempts at being weird feel so pointless.

It's a complete waste of time. Even if you can watch this at home for free, it's not worth it.

The directing skill is there, but nothing is original. It is like a collection of ideas from many good films: parasite, no country for old man, etc. So the chase scenes are interesting, but you simply don't care if they can survive. So many useless information. We don't even care if her mom is a rat or not; nobody cares. It is another film that is always with background music, the film itself showing no tension.

"Entertaining and meaningful 8-episode miniseries. Ted Danson, about 76, stars as Charles, about 76, a retired Professor of Engineering and living in San Francisco. He also is Producer of this series which sets itself apart from most by avoiding the all-too-common filthy language dialog. This in fact is very clean and more pleasant as a result.

In the story his wife had died perhaps a year ago from the effects of Alzheimer's. He is healthy but perhaps bored with his daily routine. He has a habit of reading periodicals and newspapers and often cuts an interesting one out to send to his married daughter in Sacramento. One day, through a cut-out hole he glimpses a small, short ad. Looking for someone in the 75 to 85 years age range for a specific job.

This takes him to a private investigator hired by a man whose mother is in a type of upscale old folks home in San Francisco, some meaningful jewelry was stolen and the son wants the thief to be caught. Charles will be the key.

So he is hired to check into the place and observe and report as the person to expose what is going on.

Ted Danson is just perfect in this role which he plays with lots of humor. Quickly it becomes less about who the thief was and more about the relationships. The cast of characters are played by a group of fine actors, many of them old favorites we have come to know from the past 50 years or so.

My wife and I enjoyed it, streaming. After watching the first three episodes on one evening we watched the last five episodes at one sitting after our usual Saturday evening steak and wine dinner.

I hope that there is a better cut of this film released when the second half comes out with the whole storyline, not exceeding 2 1/2 hours. These characters in this film seem so superficial.

"Top film with a high tension The House of Dynamite is an excellent film - tightly directed, smartly written, and packed with both tension and emotional weight. The story unfolds with gripping pace, blending action with character-driven drama in a way that feels both fresh and grounded. The cinematography and soundtrack complement each other beautifully, creating an immersive atmosphere throughout. Idris Elba delivers one of his best performances in recent years. He brings intensity, vulnerability, and quiet strength to a complex character, making every scene he's in magnetic. His presence elevates the film - not just as an action lead, but as an actor capable of deep emotional range. It's a reminder of how powerful he can be when given the right material.

Highly recommended.",literal
"Loveeeee I love thissss such a good hospital version of the type of shows like superstore, parks and rec etc. The comedy is spot on

I love the how there's still SOME commentary on the current climate of minimum wage jobs/capitalist society in America but it's not so much that it's depressing or a downer it's lit just funny

Soo many good characters lol the Amish guy is so funny all of them just done rly well👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻",literal
"A Random Surprise! Tulsa King is currently being shown on TV here in the UK (Jan 2023) and I randomly came across it last night as I was flipping around channels, seeing what was worth watching. I was surprised to see a Sly Stallone TV series and didn't think he'd been in one before. I have to admit, I think Rocky is the only Stallone movie I can remember ever seeing, so it's not like I'm a massive fan but I do like his acting. I had a hunch this would be a good show and it is! I got engrossed in it straightaway. It's quite punchy, witty and Sly is very watchable and sharp. His character, coming from the big city, has a culture shock, having to settle in an out of the way, dusty, Bible Belt small town that's totally alien to him but he finds his footing straightaway and (unbelievably, of course) finds a business to get involved in, and a driver too, even before he finds a hotel / motel to stay in. Kind of silly, of course, but very entertaining and I like Sly's oomph even at his advanced age. Just goes to show, age is all in the mind (well, in theory anyway!).",literal
"Terrific cast makes this worth watching Death By Lightning is one of the more surprising shows I've seen on an ex president in my life. I was so caught up in it that I couldn't stop watching. The writing and performances were fantastic. Everyone knows what great actors Michael Shannon and Matthew Macfadyen are and both are at the top of their game here. I wouldn't be surprised to see both nominated for Emmy's. The supporting cast led by Betty Gilpin, Shea Whigham, Bradley Whitford and Nick Offerman are all terrific here and could lead to some more award nominations. All you have to do is read the reviews by both critics and the audience to see how much people liked this limited series. It currently has a 92% on Rotten Tomatoes.",literal
"⭐ Good Fortune (2025) - Review Good Fortune is a breezy romantic comedy that delivers exactly what you'd expect: laughs, charm, and a feel-good story. The film thrives on its witty dialogue and the undeniable chemistry between the leads, which keeps the energy light and engaging throughout.

What stands out most is the movie's ability to mix humor with moments of genuine warmth. It doesn't try to reinvent the genre, but it embraces the classic rom-com formula in a way that feels refreshing rather than stale. The pacing is tight, the supporting cast adds plenty of flavor, and the overall vibe is colorful and uplifting.

If you're looking for a film that will put you in a good mood without demanding too much emotional investment, Good Fortune is a solid pick. It's the kind of movie perfect for a cozy night in.",literal
"1/10 Don't believe the good reviews. For anyone wondering if this is any good, it's not. I was hoping for something along the lines of Sum of All Fears type of a movie with Bigelow as the director.

Turns out, it's the same 16 min missile launch window told by one perspective. Then another from the beginning, then a third perspective.

Nobody seems to have any clue what to do, fire an intercept missile and then no back up plan. Entirely lame.

Even the President's point of view is shown and he is clueless. He has 2 minutes to act, and calls his wife on an African safarii and guess what, the call breaks up.

Then the movie ends and the credits roll. Complete Sopranos ending. No impact, fake missile or not, no resolution or decision made. Incredibly poor. 1/10 is too much.

"Pleasantly Surprise I'm genuinely surprised by how well Fantastic Four: First Steps turned out. The retro-futuristic '60s vibe works beautifully throughout, and the film feels totally different (and more mature) than previous iterations of the Fantastic Four movies.

Pedro Pascal fits perfectly as Reed Richards (and honestly IMO, he's never looked more handsome in any of his series or movies!). Vanessa Kirby brings both maturity and warmth to her role. Being the leading lady really suits her. Joseph Quinn gives us a fresh take on Johnny Storm, distinct from past versions, but in a good way. And Ebon Moss-Bachrach delivers the most down-to-earth, humble portrayal of The Thing. Plus, there's a subtle nod to his character in The Bear, which I loved.

Also, make sure to stay for the two extra scenes. In my opinion, they should've been shown in reverse order as it would've built up the hype even more effectively.",literal
"Just what the doctor ordered. I was ready to completely give up on episodic shows and then this happened, an actual diamond of a show among formulaic, recycled, regurgitated, pandering piffle. The production design and cinematography is inspiring and the cast is excellent. Narratively speaking, it's about as engaging and compelling as anything I'd consider a ""best"" example of any screened entertainment I've ever seen. Which means, it'll probably not be renewed for a 2nd season because it's just too original and interesting for American audiences.",literal
"Same banana.. different monkeys. I waited for 4 episodes, providing plenty of opportunity for the show to prove itself.

This is the exact same formula all the ""detective"", ""cop"", or ""legal"" shows take. This is more in the ""light drama"" vein than the more realistic shows, but it's still the same formula. It's ""The Finder"", ""Elsbeth"", ""So Help Me Todd"", etc.... just in a different wrapper.

If it's ""based on a French series"" that merely means the French are perfectly capable of using the same tired, hackneyed formula US shows abuse profusely, that's all.

Male + Female ""sleuth"" team, one is glib and aloof, the other serious and by-the-book, they clash, but ultimately support each other. Clues are MIRACULOUS in nature and often not anything a viewer, any viewer, could ever pick up on... and there's a rub.. a who-done-it series where the audience CAN'T figure out the outcome because they aren't privy to the miraculous (and hidden) clues yet to come - but were supposed to be there all along.

2-5 Minute opening main story... 30-35 minute random ""case"" that plays out similar to all other cases.... 2-5 minute closing main story scene to add cliffhanger for next week.. wash, rinse, repeat. So sick of this overused formula.

The premiere of these type of series can be interesting because it's the set up for the main story.. but the formula pattern sets in at episode 2.. then just repeats over and over for as long as the series is on the air - often the show is cancelled long before the main story comes to any resolution - meaning, the missing father in this series will NEVER have any answer or conclusion because it's just a ""phishing line"" of the story to keep viewers hooked for next week.

Olsen and Sunjata do a good job, well suited for the characters.. some of the other cast members (mostly the cops), not so much. And each episode has basically a large guest cast.. which is hit or miss.

Overall it's a bubblegum sleuth series.... not really horrible, but not exactly deep or complex in nature. I can see why some may like it, but I'd be surprised it sticks around for long.",literal
"15 A complete teen series.

"Beautiful Bankruptcy of Imagination Gorgeous film with blazing performances. You can't argue with classic material treated with respect. An adult retelling that reimagines the monster as more human than Universal did.

A foretelling of what AI movies will look like. Very artificial looking but in a good way if you like that kind of thing.

Bloated, could've of used a 45 minute cut to make it move efficiently. Kill your babies, directors, unless your intention is to bore the hell out your audience.

How many versions do we need? I guess if you want a budget to make a movie, you're gonna have to rehash the same old, over and over again, ad infinitum. Although this version is perfect for students of the original literature.",literal
"WTF did I just watch?!?! From almost the start, I was irritated at the filming style and directors choices, and it goes downhill from there.

What's with all the crawling??

This is supposed to be a descent into madness? We would have to see SANITY FIRST in order to compare--her character was wacky from the start.

I always go in without having seen previews or read reviews so I can have an unbiased perspective, but this was absolute garbage from start to finish.

How did they get such GREAT actors in this film?

And to be clear, the acting was decent. The writing, editing and directorial choices were what were so painful to watch.

Also, bring earplugs unless you want to go deaf, as the movie goes from straining to hear to standing next to a jet engine taking off.

Spend your time and money elsewhere--pretty much ANYWHERE is a better value.",literal
"Hoping for more The first episode of Pluribus sets up an interesting premise, even if it's mostly been done before. But by the time we get to the end of the second, it already seems slow and over stuffed with Gilligan's usual visual/storytelling tricks.

Not that those are BAD, not at all... but there has to be an engaging plot wrapped around them. And so far, there is nothing of interest, and nothing propelling the plot.

I know better than to doubt Vince - he can make a story turn on a dime and go from slow to breakneck in a second. But so far, I'm having a hard time staying engaged. So I'm hoping things will happen, and that we'll have a reason to care about anybody in the show, soon.",literal
Why is the lighting so low? This second series has appalling lighting. It is dark to the point of black screen often. Even daytime scenes are badly lit. It mskes it very difficult to watch.,literal
"A Lean Yet Powerful MCU Return Worth Revisiting This film stands out as one of the finest entries the Marvel Cinematic Universe has delivered in years. In an era where superhero fatigue is often discussed, it manages to feel fresh, engaging, and surprisingly well crafted. The only notable drawback is its relatively brief runtime, which, while keeping the pace brisk, also leaves you wishing for a little more breathing room to explore certain moments in greater depth. In fact, it occasionally feels as though certain scenes or connective sequences were trimmed or removed.

Within this tight framework, the balance of elements is remarkably effective. The humor is sharp without feeling forced, adding levity at the right points to prevent the narrative from becoming overly heavy. The moments of seriousness carry genuine emotional weight, offering stakes that feel both personal and impactful. While the action is somewhat limited compared to other MCU installments, what is present is well choreographed, visually appealing, and integrated into the story rather than serving as mere spectacle.

The performances across the board are commendable, with each actor bringing nuance to their roles. That said, one lingering wish is for more focus on certain characters. Reed Richards and Ben Grimm in particular could have benefitted from additional screen time to deepen their arcs. Likewise, Galactus, though imposing, is largely confined to narration; a flashback or more direct involvement would have heightened his menace. Shalla-Bal, the Silver Surfer, is compelling, but additional sequences exploring her homeworld, its culture, and the dire circumstances that forced her sacrifice would have enriched her arc. Seeing the emotional weight of her decision to become Galactus's herald, torn between saving her planet and surrendering her freedom, could have created a more powerful audience connection.

By the end, you may still hope these elements are expanded in a sequel, but you will not resent their absence here. And yes, it is most certainly rewatchable and thoroughly enjoyable.",literal
"Run away fast This movie starts well. You are thrown into the depth of the story and the characters quickly and you see great production design building a futuristic world that feels almost real, and undeniably cool.

But it all falls down quickly as the movie lines itself up with every other action flick ever made. Very quickly, it just feels like one of those action movies that Netflix commissions every so often. All the same. Perfectly interchangeable. Without surprises. And ultimately boring.

Of course, it's hard not to compare this version with the 1987 version starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. That wasn't a great movie by any standard, but it had a playfulness and freshness that makes this new version feel like a cheap packaged good or a reheated dish.",literal
"License to Squeal Spoilers herein.

I know why kids pollute their minds with this ADD tripe. i know why there is a Hollywood machine eager to make small lives out of feeding their puppy lust. But Samuel Jackson has a lot of explaining to do. More rides on his success than just his kids.

Look, I love excess: `Face/Off,' even `Fast and Furious' were worthwhile. The latter was cool because of the way it made fun of dolts who value cars. It even played with some dangerous racial film notions of Asians. But this isn't Bond, because it takes itself seriously. It reminded me of ""Runaway Train,"" even though it had a brief musical reference to ""the Third man.""

"This movie predicted Alexa, Reality TV and Cultural Narcissism among other things I remember renting this movie from a neighborhood video store back in 1987 or 1988. It was one of those movies that didn't interest me enough to see it when it was out in theatres. When I first saw it I thought it was fun and entertaining but too far fetched and too much gory violence. Its scary to watch it 32 years later and see how much has closer to home it hits now. An Alexa type system turns on TV and other appliances. The world economy has collapsed (Greece and other EU nations have faced similar economic crises in recent years) there are food shortages (Venezuela, the native country of Maria Conchita Alonso have empty grocery store shelves and unrest because of mass starvation). The U.S. government and the entertainment industry work in concert to keep the populace distracted by a savage reality TV show called The Running Man. Enemies of the state have no trial by jury they are merely turned over to the ruthless, scuzzy host of the show, played by Richard Dawson. Arnold Schwarzenegger is a member of the military who is railroaded by the State into participating on the show. (Keep in mind Reality TV wasnt even a concept until almost 15 years after this movie was made.) The Running Man is the #1 show on television with people caring more about the deadly cat and mouse game with the hunted actually being brutally killed on live TV with an enthusiastic studio audience cheering it on. (A chilling reminder of the desensitization of the culture in our current age of social media.) No interest in the constitution, freedom or human rights...free board games and household gadgets given away by Dawson to the audience is a much bigger draw. The movie even predicts millennial ignorance of classic TV (Gilligan's Island, is that the one with the boat? Who's Mr. Spock?)

The movie itself isn't brilliant film making or acting but 32 years on, it's not as much fun as it used to be because its too close to reality for comfort! I strongly recommend it, especially for younger viewers.",literal

"Tetro Romp - With Holes It's back to 1968 on Earth 828 (which is where, exactly?) where the FF have been getting it done for 4 (!) years and are universally loved. After Sue discovers she's pregnant (with barely a yawn from Reed), the Silver Surfer arrives to tell the world that Galactus is coming to devour the planet. Reed quickly whips up a space ship that can travel much faster than light (that'd been useful, so why the wait) and the Four including a very pregnant Sue zip off to where Galactus is to take him on. Considering they know nothing about him and that the Surfer is on his side, it doesn't go well. Galactus wants the unborn child and will spare Earth for him. They fight it out and somehow the FF get away. Surfer is trapped in a neutron star ""for a month"". BTW, Sue gives birth in the middle of this. Yep.

Reed immediately announces that Galactus wants their child to save the planet, turning everyone against them until Sue gives a sobby speech and suddenly the entire world is on their side. Reed comes up with a plan to move the entire planet to a new solar system (?!) and the world pitches in to quickly create transmitting towers everywhere for this. Galactus is taking an awfully long time to arrive, including days after he's already in the solar system. Just before they move the planet, the Surfer arrives to destroy most of these towers. Johnny, never known for genius, figures out the Surfer's language from a single sentence. Remember, this is all pre-computer. He conveniently has huge TV screens all around the city so he can broadcast her language (with voice patterns?) to get her to understand their side. Reed then figures he'll move Galactus instead of the planet, and sets up an oh-so-obvious trap with Franklin their son as bait. Galactus nearly steps in it (he must know what the transmitter is for, since the Surfer wrecked so many) but doesn't fall for the baby swap. There's a huge battle in NYC, but no casualties because everyone evacuated to the Mole Man's realm. Uh huh.

In the end, Sue somehow has enough power to push this ""sky god"" into the activated portal. Galactus is escaping until the Surfer knocks Johnny aside and forces Galactus into the portal, her included. Sue is basically dead, but tiny baby Franklin uses his cosmic power to save her. The end. Post credit scene shows four-year old Frankin talking to Dr. Doom.

It wasn't a bad movie. The retro 60's vibe was different, as was the tech shown. Reed doing everything on a blackboard though? The FX were very good. However, the plot was flat and their wasn't much chemistry between Reed and Sue. Pascal was a poor Reed, more absent minded professor than anything. A lot was said about Sue being the leader, but if there was anything to this it was only because Reed didn't act like a leader. And Reed could barely stretch! Ben Grimm came off pretty well, even if he didn't do much. Johnny Storm didn't resonate as the Torch. He was just - flat.

It's a decent standalone flick, but of course will tier into the next Avengers movie.",literal
"Great start pointless ending The first three or four episodes were really engaging, but the end of the series just leaves you with more questions than answers. It's so frustrating that this seems to be happening more and more with these limited series. It's not necessarily that the ending was not what I wanted to see or disagreeable, more so that there was no ending.",literal
"Good Movie Rating - 8.3: Overall, a cute rom-com that explores the love triangle dynamic in a unique way by touching on themes of morality and the afterlife; this movie does a good job incorporating humor throughout, but is still pretty formulaic to the rom-Com template as the second half of the movie becomes pretty safe and predictable.

Direction - Good: The direction on a macroscale feels like an homage to 60s cinema, while also using the ridiculousness of the world to add to the humor; The direction on a microscale feels like 60s cinema, and it does a good job of bringing out the comedy and the relationships in the interpersonal scenes; Storytelling is pretty simple, often using comedy and love story tropes to fall back on to drive the story forward; Tension is built by using your interest in this love triangle to keep you invested in what happens next

Story - Pretty Good to Good: The concept is a pretty unique idea for a love triangle as it explores this idea in the afterlife, touching on ideas of morality and love in a fun and cute way; The plot structure is pretty linear and formulaic; Character writing is pretty standard for a love triangle with characters being from the 50s and 60s

Screenplay - Good: The dialogue is funny as they do a good job trying to mix humor into the dialogue to make the movie funny and cute; The humor is a big part of the storytelling as it makes the movie fun and enjoyable, even though it tries to be a little too funny with there being a joke in almost every piece of dialogue; The symbolism is fun and cute as it touches on topics like love and morality, and how this plays into the afterlife; The foreshadowing is present and fine for the most part, even though it is a bit predictable towards the end

Acting - Pretty Good to Good: Miles Teller - Good (Has a lot of charisma and comedic timing; Has good chemistry with the cast, especially Olsen and Joy Randolph), Elizabeth Olsen - Good (Plays the lead well and has this 60s aura that really works for her character; has good chemistry with Teller and Turner to help bring to life this love triangle), Callum Turner - Pretty Good (Pretty good in his role and holds his own; He has pretty good chemistry with the cast, especially Olsen), John Early - Pretty Good (Plays his role well, and he has pretty good chemistry with the cast), Olga Merediz - Pretty Good (Has pretty good comedic timing and pretty good chemistry with the cast, especially Olsen), Da'Vine Joy Randolph - Good (Shows her Oscar-winning talent as she fills up the room with her personality and charm and has great chemistry with Teller), Rest of the cast - Pretty Good (Everyone plays their role well in helping elevate the cast and playing to the comedy standards the movie sets)

Score - Good: Pretty standard, helps with setting the tone and creating an entertaining energy

Soundtrack - Pretty Good to Good: Pays homage to the 50s and 60s

Cinematography - Good: Standard for a Rom-Com; pays a part in helping set up jokes and making the movie funny

Editing - Good: Standard for a rom-com; pays a part in helping set up jokes and making the movie funny

Production Design - Very Good: Make this world feel unique, as the idea of a junction before finding your eternity plays a part in the messaging for the movie, and it plays a part in the humor because many of the jokes are laid into the production design itself

Costumes - Pretty Good

Pacing - Pacing is fine for the most part, but a bit slower in the second half

Climax - Climax is cute and enjoyable, but feels very formulaic with other rom-coms that involve a love triangle

Tone - Tone very much feels like a Rom-Com that pays homage to the 50s and 60s

Final Notes - Saw premiere at Austin Film Festival.",figurative
"Let it steep I don't give any real consideration to the notion that ""sleepy"" when it comes to TV and movies means ""boring"". Yes there's a small town slow moving vibe to the pilot but what's wrong with that? American TV and films are often frenetic and loud. That also doesn't mean ""exciting"" or even good. I never pass up a slow moving film, it's gotta brew so the nuances rise to the top. I'm certainly happy to give this one some time. A nice blend of Canadian actors and a somewhat typical plot but I'm intrigued. The Sutherland progeny, well he has the perfect demeanor for this. I knew he was related just from the voice. If you like sleepy at its finest, check out the Jesse Stone films with Selleck. Those are the gold standard.",figurative
"A mature comedy that consolidates its director. Celine Song's second feature film reestablishes her as one of the most interesting directors today when it comes to portraying love in a more intense and thoughtful way. Her brilliant debut, which spoke of impossible love, now with Materialists, takes us to modern love, a love of stereotypes and mere facts and assumptions. An intense, mature, and thoughtful look at how we have stopped loving the old way.

It's supported by a brilliant cast. Dakota Johnson holds the film together with a character full of interesting layers, each of which the actress polishes with a flawless performance. Her co-stars also come in handy, with Chris Evans displaying nuances and successfully immersing himself in the drama, and Pedro Pascal continuing to unleash his full potential in a supporting role with some well-chosen moments.

This romantic drama has some interesting successes, such as putting an interesting spin on certain genre characteristics and delivering a wonderful romantic film. It intelligently addresses themes, dialogue, and a small sense of humor that lead to a story that simmers slowly, but never becomes tedious. On the contrary, it's a film that always keeps you attentive to every situation and every upcoming move.

Celine Song writes a biting and incisive script that emphasizes profound dialogue and situations that reflect the future of modern-day romantic relationships. It presents us with almost algorithmic situations of love and also makes room to raise awareness and question how exposed we are to the consequences of a stereotype without first knowing it. The director's brilliant portrayal of love, practically analogous between two of her characters, is a wonderful and sincere glimpse into what true love is, one we should never forget.

A film worth seeing and understanding. Further proof that its director is one of the most promising directors working today. While we encounter some flaws, the film hides its great appeal in those imperfections. It's a journey through a story told with intelligence and cunning that invites reflection, but also the most calculated and thoughtful entertainment, which, with subtle comedic overtones, brings joy, but never fails to teach you what love is, too.",figurative
Great Storyline I love this show! Lately there has been nothing on tv to watch. I was not going to start another series but this one showed up and I decided to give it a try. I love the Sheriff's dad! It's not a bad show as some reviewers make it to be. This started with a good storyline. Can't wait for what's next!,literal
"Intriguing but.. So this show started off great! During the first 3 hours I was sitting at the edge of my seat but now, with only 3 hours left, the show isn't making any sense... I get that they need to end it with a cliffhanger again and again and again but six hours in and we're still nowhere. I highly doubt that the show will change to the point where I'll understand why a month has gone by and nothing has been revealed but some of the stuff that's happening now could have happened 1 or 2 episodes ago... I'm sure that the finale will leave us hungry for more but at the end of the day... this is starting to feel like one of those old soap operas my grandma used to watch where she needed to watch 10 episodes at least in order for the plot to slightly, barely move forward... I will not be around for much longer so I'm hoping that the next episode will blow my mind...",literal
"As the C.S.I. shows have been to CBS, So LAW & ORDER and Family is to NBC. We generally get Cop Shows and Movies kin two different classifications. One is fanciful, escapist and a real fantasy. The other kind attempts for stark realism. It is bold, brutal and honest.

While there may be no absolute types out there, NBC's LAW & ORDER(1990-Present)is about as good an example of realism out there. For a series to have the staying power that this has, Creator/Producer Dick Wolf must be doing something right. In a business that considers a 2 season series as being exceptional, one that now goes into its 18th season,that is approaching 2 decades, has to be nearly Deofied! (in a TV/Hollywood sort of way.)

As for style or format, Mr. Wolf has ordained a strict, but not obvious nor heavy-handed form to follow. It is simply, the first half hour goes mainly the Cops, the second goes to the Lawyers and the Trial. 

For a series to have a run of such a duration we certainly would have to see many line-up changes, you know, ""Free Substitution."" And so there were! The Pilot Show had Sgt.Max Greevey(George Dzundza)& Detective Mike Logan(Chris Noth) as partners, with Captain Don Cragen(Dann Florek) as their Unit Commander. The Executive Assistant D.A. Ben Stone(Michael Moriarity)and his Partner Paul Robbinette(Richard Brooks). Claire Kincaid(Jill Hennessey-Woo, woo, woo,woo!)replaced Mr. Robbinette after season # 3.Roy Thinnes was shown as the District Attorney, for this Pilot only, as D.A. Adam Schiff(Stephen Hill) took over the reins for a long, long run.

The bosses shifted as Captain Cragen gave way to Lieutennant Van Buren(S. Epatha Merkerson)with season 4( I think!). Cragen re-appeared in 1999 as the boss of the Sex Crimes Unit in LAW & ORDER:SVU(Special Victim's Unit),which was LAW & ORDERS Spin Off #1).

The Detective Roster was the most visibly in flux element in series, with the ""old"" Cop to work with Chris Noth's Mike Logan. In the first 3 seasons we saw George Dzundza(Sgt. Max Greevey), Paul Sorvino(Sgt.Phil Cireta)) and finally Jerry Orbach (the longevity laden, Det. Lennie Briscoe).And we had too numerous changes to mention here. Suffice it is to say, there were a lot of different Detectives and A.D.A.'s in and out during the course of the series run, which continues as this is being written!

But it was also style and quality of writing and formatting that makes LAW & ORDER so watchable, habitual even. Whereas other series,e.g.HOMICIDE:LIFE ON THE STREET(1993-99)is more character driven, LAW & ORDER relies more on story. It uses those abrupt black-out with the percussion to rapidly change scenes. We know that more time has passed, but the story is edited, trimmed, cut to the bone. All unnecessary scenes are left out. 

First of all, as they so often advertise, ""...a Story ripped from Today's Headlines!"", and so they do take a well known incident, write a fictional story that plot wise is similar to the real life counterpart. And one can tell the ones that are the most obviously leaning toward the real life by the opening credits. Before there is any music or opening ""grabber"", if a disclaimer reading something lika thisa appears,""This story is fictitious. Any resemblance to any person, living or dead, is purely coincidental."", You Know that it is based on the 'Headline Story', to be sure!

And, by way of a criticism or a complaint, even, from a former Big City Cop, There is an inordinately high number of stories concerning Police Corruption/Police Miscondudt. That's not to say that the subject should be ignored, for Lord knows we are troubled with this problem and always will be some. But, c'mon, Mr. Dick Wolf,ease up a little, okay?

And just think, we get all this and Mike Post's Original Theme and Score and incidental music.

NOTE: And before we sign-off, we feel compelled to make mention of LAW & ORDER's similarity in format to the ABC & Universal Studios ""Arrest & Trial""(1963-64). It was sort of a 2 in 1 series with the first half-hour being the Police end of the drama, the ""Arrest"" and The ""Trial"" portion taking the final hour. Ben Gazara and Chuck Connors led the cast.(Look it up, Schultz!)",figurative
"Too Long, Too Vapid If the story is true, my god the police and retail management and the instincts of women in the dating pool are morons/moronic. It's about 2 hours and 6 minutes too long.

There's not much to the plot...insane guy gets away with ongoing criminal behavior, criminal meets gal, gal sees past the criminal's obfuscation because she's that desperate, gal tattles on criminal and he goes back to prison. That's it. There's nothing else except wasteful banter, fake tears, and a few gags.",literal

"Cheap and easy, but invariably charming and authentically funny A pair of hapless teenage geeks create their dream woman with the aid of a home computer and proceed to turn their social standing upside down. Not a high point for John Hughes, who directed this paper-thin fever dream of a slapstick comedy after writing the screenplay in just two days. Hughes would become known for quick penmanship later in his career - he'd write Ferris Bueller in roughly the same amount of time - but in this case that efficiency leads to an imaginative premise that never really grows to maturity. Anthony Michael Hall, in something of a leading role after breakout performances in National Lampoon's Vacation and Sixteen Candles, is responsible for a lot of what works about the finished product. His comic timing is excellent, even in the most absurd situations (of which there are many). Hall particularly soars in one drunken scene, spilling his guts and making unlikely friends with the regulars in a seedy ghetto jazz bar, but that's an early climax and the film struggles to outdo it on the home stretch. Props and gimmicks pad out the rest of the ride, along with a generous dose of fresh, Hughsian, era-defining new wave cuts. Cheap and easy, but invariably charming and authentically funny; I've burnt weeknights with worse films.",figurative
"Professional Nurses Will Be Up In Arms Having known a nurse who needed to retire because of a bad back, I started wondering how many get hooked on painkillers when that happens to them. In that vein, it's an excellent premise for a TV series. Unlike Gregory House, however, Jackie gives a damn about her patients to the same degree she flouts basic ethics from time to time.

Edie Falco is perfectly cast in this role as an unsaintly nurse who gets our sympathy. You applaud her when she flushes the severed ear of the ""diplomat"" who repeatedly stabbed a prostitute, but we don't want to end up in her ER lest we get on her bad side. The situations are compelling despite the cliché characters that surround Jackie, and we hope that they will develop into 3-dimensional people. On that note, we still hope Cooper gets what's coming to him.

The series has already been renewed for a second season, so the writers will have plenty of time to develop this dark dramedy. Only Showtime can do it.",literal
quirky magic story; spoilers included spoiler alert; OK after constant hemming and hawing i finally watched this movie i really didn't want to tell ya what is gong on in the story but it is impossible to let you know how good it really is without also giving away a few details OK after constant hemming and hawing i finally watched this movie mainly because it had Morgan freeman and isla fisher who is just too darn cute the plot actually started a little slow for me and while it becomes relatively obvious about half way thru the movie that the good cop is of course the man hidden behind the mask it is still an excellent way of presenting now only a who done it type of twist but also a fun way to show the possibilities of what actual magic tricks are like; i also liked the fact that this is a movie that actually ends with Freeman being the bad guy at the end at least in a small way,literal
"Mathew Ryhs is Superb! Claire Dane's chin acting is annoying as hell. I said what i said. Rhys was chilling. Explosive and volatile onscreen, perfectly executed his role.

Danes wasn't likeable to be honest, or her presence wasn't that engaging. Like even with Nile being such a horrible character, he still was likeable in the sense that you want to see the character move through the plot. She just looked like an animated caricature of what grief would look like, especially with the dramatic scenes. Like lady, learn some acting!

Claire Dane's whatever her name was on the show, was boring as hell, and the chin acting was annoying as hell to see. Hell, even Britanny Snow seemed like a better performer. All i thought watching Claire onscreen was ""handsome"". She definitely isnt pretty or even tries to be, i guess they are trying to make her look obviously gay on the show. Maybe because of conditioning and the standards being so high for women (guilty), I didnt like seeing her face and the closeup shots so much. Her OTT bad acting and chin wagging make it a hard watch. Some makeup would have helped!

8/10 to the plot, pace, and strong performances by Matthew, and the supporting cast are the only saving grace. Loved Carol (the agent) she plays Joey's agent too in Friends I think!

It's a bingeable thriller, definitely a speed watch, executed right. Just wish they had an actress who was easy on the eyes OR someone who acted better than the lead.

She was a let down. I may be biased. I feel Naomi watts or someone could've played a better role. If you have Dane's acting, skip it.

I hope she reads some of these reviews on here and takes an acting workshop.",literal
"Loved it!! Very cute I really enjoyed this movie. I thought it was great acting, good chemistry and cute story. I fell in love with the characters and watched the movie 3 times within a week. Overall, it's a great movie for this genre.",literal
"a bit of a mess if you want the truth This film can't decide what it wants to be, and ends up just being way too long. 

You  will probably have read other reviews here before mine which mention the terribly out of place Kung Fu sequences, the pointless violence, terrible plot line and rather bizarre choice of ending.

What most have failed to mention is the incredibly weird sexism that is going on on this film. SPOILERS follow.... 

Why the beast is referred to as a ""she"" is never explained. Nor why it only attacks women and children. It is also unclear why the brotherhood of the wolf is called a brotherhood when there are clearly women in it. The whole thing was bizarre; and don't get me started on why they have a high official from the Vatican who is not only a female (I don't know of many high ranking Vatican women now never mind in the 17th century!) but also parading as a whore (seems unlikely don't you think) 

Finally a comment on some of the previous reviews - many of whom seemed to be American. I have noticed many of them attack the French in some intense need to declare their own cinematic superiority. Yes i agree Brotherhood of the Wolf isn't a great film, but have these people never seen or heard of Delicatessen, or Amelie or Cyrano De Bergerac or Betty Blue all fabulous French films. 

And by the way didn't the Americans give us films starring Sinbad, as well as Hudson Hawk, The Animal and anything starring Adam Sandler. People in glass houses....",figurative
"HILARIOUS except... One of the funniest shows ever. But like someone wrote before this, season 11 and 10 are SOOO BAD. 10 had some emotional moments but besides that no. And 11 is hard to watch. Like I have to force myself to watch the weekly episodes. I'm only watching them to say I've seen all the seasons.",literal
A tension filled two hours Kathryn Bigelow directs this countdown to a nuclear strike which we see from a number of different perspectives concluding with that of the US President played by Idris Elba. It's very well done as one would expect from a Bigelow film with a clever use of intersecting moments linking each viewpoint.,literal
Lots of fun! I absolutely love the first Nobody movie and it was honestly one of the most underrated films I watched in 2021. I was super excited for this film and although I don't think it's better than the first film I think it's still a great time but there's some things which I didn't think worked too well compared to the first film. Let me get my positives out the way I think Bob Odenkirk is fantastic as always and does another great performance playing Hutch and I love the direction this character is taking with a possible franchise happening ever. I also really enjoyed the family dynamic of the movie and how the family elements also play a big role in this movie like the first film as well and I really enjoy these moments. The action was also fantastic and there's some awesome action moments throughout the movie and this movie has some awesome choreography with some of the action scenes here in this film. I also think most of this movie has some great moments throughout its runtime and there's some good emotional moments as well. I think what makes this film lackluster a little is how many characters the movie tries to balance and we don't really get to see most of these characters do much and the movie just throws them to the side for majority of the film which isn't fun unfortunately as I wanted to see more character storylines in this. I also think the story is all over the place as well and there's some moments which make the movie feel a little dumb at times which I know this movie isn't doing anything too serious but there's some dumb plot lines in the movie. I also feel like this movie should've been longer as well as this movie literally flies by and just glances over some things which I wish they would've touched on more throughout the story and the writing is a little funky sometimes as well. Although there's some good comedy inserted throughout the movie which I found to help the movie just like how it helped out the first movie. This is still definitely a fun movie worth checking out in theaters and I would still recommend it for sure!,literal
Kelly Moran It's funny this whole season I've been asking myself why do they keep bringing this guy back he is TERRIBLE! And now I read it trending here hes the Executive Producer's son! Makes total sense now guess that's how it works in Hollywood still its all about who you know or who your father is. I bet this guy says Do you know who my father is alot!,literal
"More of the Same...And That's the Point Let's be real: Nobody 2 is a routine sequel. It doesn't try to outdo the first, it just copies its structure, sprinkles in more chaos, and keeps the runtime tight. Honestly? That works. It's fun, fast, and doesn't waste your time pretending to be anything other than what it is: a slick, dumb-good action flick.

The direction and storytelling are fine, some reviews say it's less clear than the first, but I don't see it. It's straightforward and confident. You're not here for nuance; you're here for Bob Odenkirk smashing skulls in creative ways. And on that front, it delivers.

Now, about Sharon Stone. Bold choice. Wild energy. Feels like she was aiming for ""iconic villain"" and landed somewhere around ""theme park haunted house manager."" Fun to watch, sure, but wow, it's a lot.

If you liked Nobody, this gives you more of the same with a bit more ridiculousness. No complaints here.",literal
"This one deserves a remake with more body count n mayhem but minus the spandex suits. I first saw this in the early 90s on a vhs which I used to own. Revisited it recently.

I enjoyed 95 % of Arnold's films n action films of the 80s but i didn't enjoy this one then n not even now.

This one is very mild as ther r no brutal kills n the villains r more comic book style. Ther is absolutely no tension or suspense. The film does have some good one liners, the yellow spandex suit is hilarious, the Christmas tree guy is a big lol but watch out for those 80s dresses n moustaches inspite of the film set in 2019.

Check out for Lin Shaye as the propaganda officer and Franco Columbu as the 911 Security Officer #2.",literal
"Everything but the finish Everything was beautiful - styling, cinematography, cgi (mostly), and especially the pacing. Loved 3/4 of the movie. The last part was disappointing to say the least. But hey, you can't please everyone. I just wished they didnt treat galactus like a stupid kid in the end. ""Oh lets try the 'ol switcheroo and hope he doesn't notice that there's no baby in the thing"". After that, the writing just fell off to me. So many questionable decisions. Wished they thought of something ingenious that the real Mr. Fantastic would think of. Anyway, I would've rated it a 9 if it weren't for the ending. I'd still say good job for this film Marvel. Hope they make more movies like this.",figurative
"Swing and a miss Valiant effort.

I wasn't familiar with The Paranoid Paranormal YouTube show until waiting in line for the screening, but the IYKYK vibe I'd then hoped for didn't even pay off (or maybe it did? Some true fan please tell me it did.)

It really seemed to sputter and burn out in the third act where what was intriguingly setup prior to felt crudely resolved like quickly gathered horror-trope loose ends of recent memory.

Did they hold off on some unused footage reserved for a hopeful sequel? Or simply telling Chris that selling his soul now will get him something better in the future?

Whatever it is, I respect how he got this made and the commitment to a longer form creative project like this - and I'm still intrigued to see what he does next.",literal
"Monster almost is ""Springtime for H_tler"" It is disappointing that they managed to make the Ed Gein story about the Holocaust. It is an unwelcomed, unnecessary intrusion. Furthermore, it does nothing for the story, and it brought me out of the seriousness of the subject matter. There is nothing wrong with including it, but it received way more time than was necessary.",literal
"Entertainment all the way down!! Claire Danes is so incredibly good at playing someone who is constantly on edge/stressful/at the brink of a mental breakdown etc. I thought it was a little bit too much at some moments. But she sure does give her all with every performance. Matthew Rhys was really scary and creepy here. Both phenomenal actors who did a fantastic job and had great chemistry.

It was very enjoyable. Good tension, acting and everything else was just done well.",literal
"Not even close to The Sopranos If you're hoping for something like The Sopranos, don't waste your time on this one. Mafia bosses here act more like kids, no real consequences for anything-they just live in this ""do whatever, whenever"" world. Justice doesn't really exist in Tulsa King. The power of ""the general"" seems to come out of nowhere; people follow him just because, well, the plot says so. Why anyone respects him is also a mystery. Some characters flip from being pretty normal to suddenly violent, all to fight for ""the general"", and then switch back to calm like nothing happened. Honestly, it feels more like Zombieland than a serious mafia show. It's the kind of series you'll watch once and probably never want to rewatch.",figurative
"has metoo taught us nothing? Erm, kinda iconic i guess. Shame that they hired Joshua Tomar after what he did but that's hollywood for you i guess, that's why i can only give it an 8/10.",literal

"PG version of IT for kids I enjoyed the two It films and while they weren't super scary, the characters and story kept you interested. The actors of both the young and older character versions were well cast. I thought Bill Skarsgård was terrific in his own interpretation of Pennywise/It. This TV series prequel to the films is the opposite. The scares so far aren't creepy or scary, very dull and PG-watered down version for kids, the cheap-looking CGI doesn't help either. The plot and characters feel so forced, dialogue is cringe. The military subplot is boring. I'm not invested in any of the characters and overall story. It's weak, hackneyed writing! And... it's already the second episode and still no glimpse of Pennywise himself. I'm not sure if I'll continue watching. I guess I do like that they used a lot of the same sets and locations they used for the It films. But I have high doubts the rest of the episodes will improve or be more of the same or worse.",literal
"About the most boring movie I've seen in my life. Personally, I thought this movie was boring, so boring to where there were only a couple jokes I found somewhat funny the entire movie, yes this is one of those more song driven movies that are with very little humor, it also appeared as the people I went with(which one of them was a little kid who was laying on one of our arms for half the movie and it wasn't late either, it started at like 12:50 PM I think) wasn't that into it either. First, about the first hour before she got on her adventure was extremely boring, not much was happening and it was all just her not wanting to go, actually during this time, I was so bored, that I went to the bathroom and took my time(usually I run to get back to the movie) and when I got out, I actually got on my phone and looked at how ""bad"" the reviews would be for this movie, it turns out I was very wrong, it has very good reviews and I was surprised. When I got back in there, a little later it got slightly more interesting after she got on her boat, but it still was pretty boring, I even went to the bathroom a second time even though I probably could've held it. I don't think I've been to a more boring movie in my life, the songs seemed pretty generic and I know at least 1 repeated itself later on the movie. I personally didn't care for Frozen either though which I think is the market this is aimed for. This is honestly making me start to lose hope in Disney, I think they've done messed up TV, and now they're messing up movies it seems. I think it is overrated but that's just my opinion. All I can say is that if you like Frozen, you'd probably like this movie. But if you didn't care for Frozen, you'd probably find this one of the most boring movies of your life. I don't even think it's me outgrowing cartoons, I like cartoons but this is just boring, I think it may be they're all aimed for little kids(probably little girls for this one) now, whatever happened to family movies. This movie was so boring, that I was literally able to tell what kind of plot it has, it has a Hero's Journey plot in case you're wondering, I know a lot of movies have the plot, but it's not supposed to be this plain obvious to where I can tell either while or right after I watched the movie. I also think this being about some fictional religion was just weird, like how were the islanders in trouble when the darkness was like halfway around the world, then why would that goddess be that thing that was trying to kill them, it would make more since if we could've saved 10 minutes by her just saying to give her the thing then and that she was the goddess but no, gotta make it obvious about that Hero's Journey plot, seriously. So overall I wouldn't recommend this movie to hardly anyone unless they like Frozen and I personally find this movie very overrated.",figurative
"Unwatchable First problem with series is totally unconvincing faces- full make up which would need hours and hours to apply- but in order to make main female younger she has face painted white- and neck much darker, so it is literally unwatchable. Clothes? Plot is thin and twists simple and predictable. It is waste of time.",literal
"overrate I started watching this movie with the expectation of seeing a masterpiece. But what I got was not worthy

The costumes are quite great, the music and lighting are also points that need to be praised. But that's all that impressed me

The movie took a lot of time at the beginning to build up the characters, but did not make the most of it. After patiently watching the beginning, the ending was too quick and the rather modest details disappointed me (eg the Asian woman who invited the vampire to the bar regardless)

Of course the movie has a layer of metaphorical meaning, but it is not at all profound or difficult to recognize. By building the vampire as a white man trying to attack people of color, it is too simple to realize that this is an allusion to racism in the past.

The character of the white girl Mary who always tries to follow and seek love from the black guy also shows a part of the rather contemptuous view for white people.

I know that black people have suffered a lot of injustice in the past, and I have no prejudice against them. But in terms of an objective view of a movie, this is a disappointing movie. The movie completely tries to praise black people as heroes and white people are either evil or have to follow them to be loved. Perhaps only black people can give this movie a high score.",figurative
"A Really Nice Criminal Trailers can show too much and sometimes show too little. The trailer for this film shows you just the right amount. It is a true story, so people can cheat and look up the story of Roofman aka Jeffrey Manchester. But I do not suggest this if you intend to see the movie. I went in clueless, except for the very entertaining, neat and tidy trailer. I am glad I took this approach. I enjoyed letting the story unfold. I enjoyed the tension not knowing what will happen to Jeffrey. I enjoyed this film very, very much.

My enjoyment of the film begins with a fantastic performance from Channing Tatum as Manchester. Jefferey Manchester is a family man at heart, a man who is on the outs with that family. He has been unsuccessful at keeping a job. He is an ex-soldier, and veterans sometimes have difficult assimilating back into society. His friend Steve (LaKeith Stanfield) is not helpful. He is, let's just say, a bit shady. The advice he gives Jeffrey is equally shady. Will Jeffrey listen to Steve?

If you see the trailer, you know that Jeffrey aka Roofman ends up spending some time in a Toys R Us (the last store went out of business in 2017, but the film is set between 1998 and 2004 - which is why we also see Blockbuster Video stores). You also know from the trailer that Peter Dinklage is in it (as store manager Mitch), and that the movie also features Kirsten Dunst (as Toys R Us employee Leigh Wainscott). Adding to this strong veteran cast is Ben Mendelsohn as Pastor Ron, and Uzo Aduba as his wife and co-pastor Eileen. Throw in Juno Temple for good measure as Steve's main squeeze and ""business"" partner, and you will look forward to seeing all these fine actors do some of their best work.

Full disclosure; do not expect the movie to be summarized by that trailer. Oh, it is entertaining enough, but it is also much more potent emotionally than I was prepared for by seeing that trailer. Which is good thing. This movie has a wonderful depth to it that was a surprise to me. A pleasant surprise. There is already some buzz about it slipping into The Golden Globe slate of nominations, and depending on what happens there it could have further representation in other award shows. This could provide yet one more surprise.",literal
"Uneven, but still an enjoyable film ""One Battle After Another"" is ambitious and visually striking, with moments of real power. It is not flawless, but there's enough here to admire and enjoy.

The story spans multiple years and layers, following ex-revolutionaries who must reckon with their past when old enemies resurface. The setup is bold and full of promise, though at times the film lags in its middle portion, repeating sequences or drifting without immediate narrative urgency. Some scenes feel longer than they need to be.

Still, the action is effective and the film builds some strong set pieces. The pacing recovers toward the end, and the climactic moments deliver tension and stakes.

The performances are solid. Leonardo DiCaprio Sean Penn, Benicio del Toro portray their characters flawlessly, but Regina Hall and Chase Infiniti are also highlights.

Visually, the film is very refined. The cinematography, design, and scale show care. The score by Jonny Greenwood is a standout, adding layers of tension and emotional texture throughout.

In conclusion: ""One Battle After Another"" is a bold, uneven but somewhat compelling film. It sure trips in parts, but its ambition, atmosphere, and strong moments make it worth the ride.",figurative
"Brilliant visuals, simple plots I have to say the most eye-catching feature of the movie is its ""retro futurism"" art style. The traces of it, the retro futurism, can be found in every detail of the movie, the costumes, the furniture design, or the vehicle's look. These elements are perfectly matched, which make the ""retro futurism world"" more real, and make you sinked there.

However, as one of the marval fans, especially who has seen the movie like Captain America 2 or 3, it's not hard to find the plot unrealistic, even naive.

Anyway, as a family-type blockbuster, the fantastic 4 reaches my expectations.",literal
"Well done 1st episode Just watched the first episode of Task. It is worth watching and I will watch upcoming episodes. I'd binge it if I could. A number of character storylines introduced and now I'd like to know more. Acting, writing, cinematography are all A+.

Mark Ruffalo leads the FBI task force and like all good leads has some personal problems. I like it when a brief moment in dialogue reveals so much backstory. Then you know and the story moves forward.

There's not a lot of action but a bit does occur in the first episode. This is not an action crime movie. It's a good story or about to be one.

Hope the remaining episodes are as good.",literal
"Sounded like it was going to be good Well onto episode 5 and really struggling to keep watching... The idea and trailer sounded great! The writing is lacking, their is stuff not needed where they could of added more added story. Kinda has that badly dubbed bgrade movie feel but not in a good way sadly.

Good idea and poorly executed sadly.",literal
"The jumping of the shark I've been watching this since the beginning and each episode has felt iffy between the backstory of the evil doctor that's now the chief and the general disregard for medical reality.

That all just came to an abrupt end when she continues resuscitation efforts on a patient that she has just been told has signed a DNR. This is both morally reprehensible and illegal and should result in immediate dismissal and arrest.

I don't know if that happened because I immediately stopped watching. It is obvious that one of two things are going to happen: 1. She gets away with it (shark jump) 2. The show becomes all about the ensuing trial -- something I have no interest in.",literal
I liked the show overall... Tries to be realistic with a science fiction computer expert The story lines are generally dark with gruesome horrible murders. Showing the worst of humanity. The FBI profilers generally able to find the bad guys. It is good with one hiccup. The computer expert is so wrong. She bangs on the keys with a pen in her fingers typing much faster than humanly possible. She never even looks at the output on the screen but still manages to interact with it. IMPOSSIBLE! She carries on conversations with others in the room not even one time does she look at the screen yet she is pounding out the code and getting output. Then all of a sudden she looks at the screen and BAM exactly what she wants is presented. I really hate the character she is and airhead trying to be smart.,literal
Horrible horrible replacement for Abbie I mute her when she comes on! Can't stand her acting. She tries to hard. Saw her on 2 broke girls and she was the same. Wasn't there anyone else for the position? We need more Deliah!,literal
"Too Long, Too Slow and Too Unclimactic I watched this film in the cinema and by the 3rd act I was already pulling my phone out and that's never a good sign. I hate to be this person, but yes, the movie is not as good as the book and Colleen Hoover is not a great writer, so that says a lot about the script.

The Good

Mckenna Grace and Mason Thames, the young actors who play Clara and Miller, respectively, are the highlights of the movie. McKenna especially made miracles with the weak script. If she would've had more emotionally explosive scenes in the movie, like Clara did in the book, she could've saved this movie, but alas the writers couldn't be bothered. Thames was great as a supporting character to her. He's likeable and charismatic.

The Bad

Franco and Williams. Franco does not fare well in dramatic roles nor has the charisma/confidence/looks to be a leading love interest. He does comedy and horror well but not drama. For Williams, this was a very good opportunity to break into the rom-com genre and establish her as a true leading lady, and sadly she just couldn't cut it. It doesn't help Franco and Williams have ZERO chemistry, or the AI used on them during the flashback scenes of when they were younger.

I think they could've used younger actors who look like them instead of AI.

The Ugly

The script. If you're going to change the story, make it better not worse or at least make it make sense. Why didn't Morgan check Clara's location on her phone when she was in Jonah's house cleaning it? We see Morgan drawing (the most basic interior designs for her home) and then we never hear anything about that again or see the end result. Was that the passion she was desperately trying to find after her world was shattered? We'll never know I guess. Morgan telling the truth to Clara made her seem selfish and weak, which is why this doesn't happen in the book. Character development? -we don't know her. Morgan doesn't seem to change at all other than falling in love with Jonah as if that's all a woman needs, a man. *yawn*

Don't waste your money like I did going to the movies. If you're gonna watch this wait until it's streaming and get prepared for two, very long, hours.",literal
I really liked the movie This movie is quite great ... l really love it . The acting was good and the main character was really good . The way he was investigating the crime scenes brought out the detective vibes .. he was really good . L love the fact that he did not jump to conclusion he clearly brought the issue of thorough investigation and understanding of the crimes to catch the real culprit . Also l liked the fact .. that the woman was a straight talker and also asked information about what the guy do .. it's really good to know the person u are getting involved with ... all in all the movie is good and their acting skills too.,literal
"A decent start.  Some tweaking on the sequel and it could be great. I thought XXX wasn't bad, although there was a LOT of `creative plagiarism' going on.  You could tell that the producers wanted specific things in the movie that were taken from other (better) movies.

Some things were a little over-the-top, though.  Namely the magical flying motorcycle stunts.  Somehow, the flying people in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon seemed more believable.

I liked the snowboard sequence and the car vs. sub scene.  .and the corvette jump was nice too.  Hopefully the 2nd and 3rd and 4th ones will just keep getting better.  After all, even James Bond wasn't all that great in the beginning.",literal
"Great fun This show is very enjoyable and I can't wait for season 4. Season 1 starts of the show at a 10/10 absolutely perfect with great characters hooking me and many others from the start. Season 2 is almost as good at a 8/10 but this season has the worst episode in the show, it is just painful. Season 3 again is great at a 9/10 I think I enjoy it a bit more than most people, but this season is the most ""This show is in the 80s"" thing about the show but still great.",literal
"Horrible, unoriginal show! I usually don't agree with a lot of reviews here but this show is definitely subpar. The plot is trite using an unseen Moriarty to further the plot but with no explanation. It is an overused ploy to keep the viewer hooked but it did not work for me. The medical cases are overly contrived. This show has taken the plots of all previous medical show and combined them in an unbelievable way. Watson is an uninspiring saviour. The dialogue is tedious and the acting unremarkable.. I stopped watching after the second episode. It has all been done before. I love. I am a fan of Sherlock and Morris Chestnut but I cannot recommend this show.",literal
"Poor imitation Chestnut tries to sound ""knowledgeable"" by speaking so fast that it's difficult to even comprehend the words coming out of his mouth. Add to that the unnecessary premise that he is ""DrWatson"" and a former colleague of Sherlock Holmes makes it farcical. Only reason I can imagine such a story line is that the entire show is actually playing out in his imagination while he is, in reality, in a coma due to his brain injury incurred at the beginning of Ep 1! Don't think I can be bothered going through the angst of trying to decide what he is saying (I have a medical background so can follow very easily when actors speak legibly)!",literal
Fair (at best) Was looking forward to this. Mostly disappointed. Story not well told with lackluster character development. The music just didn't work for me. A complete mismatch with the presentation and proved a horrible distraction. The sound was even missing. The music was extremely loud while the story was much lower. Not very well done. How sad.,literal
"Weird Science From writer/director John Hughes (The Breakfast Club, Ferris Bueller's Day Off) I had a vague idea of what this film consisted of, and I was pretty close. Basically two nerdy teenage boys, Gary Wallace (The Breakfast Club's Anthony Michael Hall) and Wyatt Donnelly (Ilan Mitchell-Smith) are desperate to be liked, and of course sex-obsessed, and in their desperation (inspired by watching - a coloured version of - Frankenstein, 1931) they decide to create the perfect woman. They weren't counting on the computer gaining so much power it would actually make their woman a reality, but it happens, and Lisa (Kelly LeBrock) is determined to help them have a good time. Lisa, who can get absolutely anything she wants (e.g. expensive cars, mutant bikers to appear) has a purpose to turn them into men by putting them in a couple of situations to boost their confidence, and they are on the road to becoming accepted by others. Of course it is at the big party (they always wanted) they meet the girls they would have always wanted, and Lisa's job is done. Also starring Bill Paxton as Chet Donnelly, Suzanne Snyder as Deb, Judie Aronson as Hilly, young Robert Downey Jr. as Ian, Robert Rusler as Max, Commando's Vernon Wells as Lord General, Britt Leach as Al Wallace, Barbara Lang as Lucy Wallace, Ivor Barry as Henry Donnelly, Ann Coyle as Carmen Donnelly and the original Hills Have Eyes' Michael Berryman as Mutant Biker. LeBrock is obviously very attractive, and there are one or two amusing moments, but the comedy is pretty crass, but it was interesting to see younger Paxton and especially future star Downey, Jr. in a film of this sort. It was number 42 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments. Okay!",literal
"Great surprise. I've gotta tell I wasn't very excited about this movie, specially with Ariana Grande, but it was a big surprise for me. And the actor who plays Elphaba is also very talented.

Apart from the fact I don't think Wicked has the best story line, the movie made the best out of it, in my sincere opinion. Direction is great!

I didn't know they would split it in two, so I was expecting the whole story in this movie, but I think it is better this way, because they can explore all the story, the development of the characters etc.

Art direction is a 10/10. Singing also perfect. Watch it, you won't regret it!",literal
"Poor Morris The show wasn't very well written. His manner of speaking flip-flops between being American and what some people think British people sound like or some of the things they say it comes off as disingenuous if. It could have been a good show if the writing was better it's not the actor's fault. They were all OK. I guess it doesn't help that there's another medical show where the doctor is trying to figure out strange illnesses also on another channel and he has some personality issues That stem from a neurological disorder. With chestnut trying to pull double duty, it just makes it more difficult.",literal
Sooooooo Bad Liam has fallen down the Burt Reynolds rathole of awful movies. Nothing short of a complete rewrite could have saved this hokey script. Two wasted hours I'll never get back.,literal
"This is Peak HBO Task is a new crime drama from HBO and I can't say enough about how great this series is. This series is about a Task Force led by an FBI agent (Mark Ruffalo) who has to put an end to a string of violent robberies by a family name (Tom Pelfrey). Ruffalo and Pelfrey give memorizing performances that you just can't stop watching. HBO hit another home run with this limited series. We've seen stories like this before, the car and mouse game between the police and the criminal so a show really has to be great to stand out and Task definitely does that. It's a masterful series that's one of the must see shows this year. I can't say enough not recommend this show enough so do yourself a favor and go watch this as soon as you can..",figurative
"A decent next attempt at IT This 2017 production of Stephen King's book is a well-crafted, decently acted imagining of the story. I really enjoyed it but did speak to some people who were disappointed that it had diverged from the book too much.

In brief, the children of Derry are going missing at an alarming rate. Something evil lurks in the town and it's up to the Loser's Club to overcome their fear and unite to confront IT ...

I found the old TV movie somewhat dull in the second half. The first half, which this movie is concerned with, was always the stronger half and I think this version is probably just as good, if not better than the original TV movie. It's certainly more gruesome and scary.

I'm not sure Tim Curry's Pennywise has been upstaged though. Bill Skarsgard has done a good job but I think Curry's is hard to beat.

IT 2017 is refreshingly old-school, in that it focuses on character and story, unlike too many recent ""horror"" movies. It is beautifully shot and superbly acted but perhaps could move at a slightly better pace.

IT will divide opinions due to story vs screenplay issues but it's definitely not a bad remake.",literal
"1 because I can't give it a ZERO!!! An absolute waste of time!!! This isn't even a think piece. It is a piece, of trash! It started out so well then went to a black screen. Oh ok, now what? Oh, the movie recaps everything you just saw from a different character's perspective. Which character you ask? Who cares, it's a random character you haven't been invested in and have not seen.

Then black screen. Now what? Same trash! New character you have never seen before and don't care about.

Now what? Black screen? No, the end! Of what? The most stupid waste of time EVER!!!",literal
"Written in the same vein as Gran Torino If you're a Clint Eastwood - Gran Torino fan, you may enjoy this story. Liam Neeson is the perfect character to portray the story about a worn out war vet desperately looking for closure to his life after the death of his from cancer. If you're looking for an action packed flick, this movie's not for you.",literal
"Great show with a sprinkle of identity politics. If you can suspend your disbelief so far that it would include all of the identity politics spectrum of today, then you'll really enjoy this show. As for me - this is where it lost a few points.",literal
"An overdue rehabilitation of Garfield This all-too short miniseries in its timing and duration do accurately reflects the all-too short presidency of James Garfield, leaving this viewer, and I suspect others, wishing for a longer run, echoing perhaps the loss the nation felt at the presidency cut short. Of course then the 24-7 news cycle could not expose the man and myth the way a four-part dramatized telling of the reluctant president's last 16 months of life - cut down 3 months in office and slowly dying over 3 more months due to medical malpractice (out of institutional ignorance and practitioner arrogance not incompetence)

The miise-en-scène pleasantly captures the period as contemporary audiences have come to expect from other great films about Lincoln and Grant. Actors Shannon, Macfayden, Offernan, Whigham, Whitford, Marcus, and Gilpin offer superb performances, pulling this viewer into the story with disbelief fully forgotten.

Macfayden steals the limelight as the deluded narcissist who deserves to be nameless. But Shannon and the rest of the cast hold their own, offering us the strong show we expect when we see these names. Certainly the writing gave them great lines and the director set great scenes.

As a youth we were taught, as First Lady Garfield tells the sad and disturbing villain, that her husband James Garfield would be remembered as a trivial footnote of the presidency, the man who managed to get himself killed before he could amount to much.

But as good historical drama so often can, and its authors do often intend, this view of Garfield is shattered forever in my mind. Now I see the man who brought us the civil service, even if his vice president Chester Arthur signed the legislation. He brought additional civil rights reform for black Americans and, by application, to all of us. But mist significantly the movie suggests, trumpets, the idea that Chester Arthur was reformed as a person and served as a better president because of Garfield's positive leadership. In this respect the writers, and let us say the names Mike Makowsky and Candice Millard, and director Matt Ross, have done his legacy a service.

For I now believe had he not been struck down by the madman's bullet, President James Garfield may have risen to be one of the greatest progressive presidents of our history. The able Michael Shannon sold this idea, supported by Nick Offerman.",literal
"An original vampire movie with some bite Sinners had a lot of hype going into it, hailing as Ryan Coogler's best work, and one of the best films of the year. So going into this I expected it to meet those expectations, and let's just say, it did, and then some. Let me get the biggest positive out of the way, this is the best musical score of the year. The film is drenched in southern blues music and it absolutely fits so well into the film's theme of culture. The characters are all extremely fleshed out. Smoke and stack ( played by Michael b Jordan) each have their own personal struggles (sins) that they are trying to overcome, and every character gets their own moment. The only thing that I found to be a bit of a problem was that some of the dialogue was hard to hear, because it was drowned out by the music. Other than that,Sinners is a pretty fantastic film, that is an exploration of culture and how they can be lost due to appropriation, and the idea of leaving the past behind to better one self. I highly recommend this, go in blind and you'll have a bloody good time.",literal
"Great show! Should have a serious trigger warning This show is amazingly realistic with fantastic character development. The show is very creative and unique. I was initially skeptical that each episode is about a hour of their day but the format is a unique way to really dive in and give you a glimpse of what it is like.

That being said it is so realistic that if you have basically any form of medical trauma this show will be pretty intense and triggering. It covers a lot of very real and intense topics that happen and if you have experienced one of them personally it can be a lot. Proceed with caution but know it is high quality show that is one of the best doctor shows I've seen.",literal
"Compelling and repellant in equal measure, Dahmer is the most definitive look at not just the titular killer, but the origins and fallout of his heinous actions. Starting in July 25, 1991, notorious serial murderer Jeffrey Dahmer (Evan Peters) is arrested when Dahmer's potential victim Tracy Edwards (Shaun J. Brown) miraculously escapes and brings the police back to his apartment. Dahmer is arrested after uncovering the various horrors and mementos from Dahmer's murders, we soon go back through Dahmer's past to see what lead him to this point before eventually shifting focus to the stories of the victims, the fallout felt by the community and victims' families, as well as the bureaucratic and law enforcement failures that allowed Dahmer to continue indulging his twisted appetites.

Dahmer-Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story is the latest project from noted producer Ryan Murphy whose prolific work on the likes of American Horror and Crime Story lead to him getting an overall deal with streamer Netflix. Beginning development in 2020, the miniseries is the fourth dramatic take on the infamous serial killer following three independent productions, 1992's The Secret Life, 2002's Dahmer, and 2017's My Friend Dahmer receiving very degrees of responses with My Friend Dahmer arguably the best of the three. When the miniseries was first announced I was skeptical because I didn't think there was any more to be told about Dahmer than we'd already learned from years of rubbernecking let alone three film attempts, but much to my surprise I found this miniseries to not only exceed my expectations, but shattered them as Dahmer-Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story is one of the year's best TV shows and if you end up seeing only one Dahmer related piece of media in your life, make it this one.

While the show may be titled after serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer, he's only half of what this movie is about. While the first 3 or four episodes dive extensively into Dahmer's childhood from age six where he first began to manifest his macabre interest in dead animals and dissecting them through his teens and 20s where we see the effects of Dahmer's unstable homelife, repressed homosexuality, and darkening appetites, the movie places more focus on the lead-up to Dahmer's actions as well as the fallout that came after the horrifying revelations came to light (and not just with Dahmer himself). Intermixed with the scenes of Dahmer socially engineering his victims, struggling with keeping his compulsions in check, or failure to maintain professional and personal relationships, we're shown a series of failures either through incompetence, apathy, distraction or neglect that disregard the obvious warning signs surrounding Dahmer as he deals with barely concealed issues that are missed by parents, educators, law enforcement, or administrative officials with those who actually try to shine a light on Dahmer's actions ignored at best or punished or threatened with punishment at worst. This is a show that despite being set in the early 90s is no less prescient today with issues such as systemic racism and homophobia still very much allowing inaction or harm to victims, and an award ceremony scene where two police officers are rewarded for simply avoiding responsibility for handing a child over to Dahmer will make your blood boil with how little has changed in regards to the ""blue wall of silence"" and the corruption of police unions in keeping unfit officers out of the profession.

The acting is solid across the board. Evan Peters is really good is the titular Dahmer as he captures the tragedy of his situation in the early years, but Peters and the creative team don't try to use this as an excuse or easy answer (an epilogue says as much there's no simple answer) and Dahmer's metamorphosis from struggling confused adolescent to cold calculating opportunistic predator who justifies his actions with a false victimhood complex makes it clear that Dahmer's actions have no ""out"" from his responsibility for them. The movie is an ensemble and features a number of characters either recurring or one off who are integral to the plot. Easily my favorite comes in the form of deaf actor Rodney Burford who plays Dahmer's victim Tony Hughes and the entire episode is anchored to the POV of this character with characters using ASL to communicate, muffling the audio to create verisimilitude, and you feel like you get to know Hughes in a way we've never been allowed to see before. Make no mistake, this is a starmaking performance from Burford so expect to see much more of him in the future, I guarantee it. The show also features terrific performances from arguably the two ""cores"" of this movie, Niecy Nash as Dahmer's neighbor and until now unsung hero of this story Glenda Cleveland, and veteran character actor Richard Jenkins as Dahmer's torn and conflicted father Lionel.

With Nash's Glenda, we get the feeling of powerlessness and helplessness from the people on the ground affected by Dahmer's actions as noted in the movie that Dahmer lived in a cheap rundown part of Milwaukee and targeted mostly people of color as his victims. While Glenda reports the awful smells coming from Dahmer's apartment to the landlord as well as sounds of screening of fighting to the police, not only is she often ignored, but is shouted down by the police such as the infamous incident wherein officers John balcerzak and Joseph Gabrish took Dahmer's word that 14 year-old Konerak Sinthasomphone was actually his drunk 19 year old boyfriend instead of his victim who'd been given an amateur lobotomy by Dahmer instead of an escaped victim despite Glenda's pleas. The movie isn't excessively gory as the gore is limited to only plot important scenes, but just because it's not as bloody as Saw or Hostel doesn't make it easier to watch and in some cases it's actually harder. Richard Jenkins is really strong as Dahmer's father Lionel and the different points of the story that portray him as wanting to help his son but not knowing how are heartbreaking because you see in Lionel the confusion and discomfort that make him unable to give Dahmer the help he needs because he very much denies there even is a problem and tries to write it off as something that can be cured with tough love or firm guidance. There isn't any singular point of blame you can link to Dahmer (as the show isn't about ""understanding Dahmer""), but the show does give us some potential issues such as a mentally unstable mother, a distant father, and internalized feelings of abandonment, but even then these aren't frame as excuses. The show stays good even after the actual crimes of Jeffrey Dahmer are over and done with by the halfway point, as the show shifts focus away from Dahmer and looks at the media fallout, the insane fandom surrounding Dahmer, the exploitation of tabloids and indie comics that trivialize Dahmer and his victims, and to watch these victims and their families be at the mercy of harassing phone calls and invasive pictures by rubbernecking tourists is painful to watch.

If I haven't made it clear, Dahmer-Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story is one of the best TV projects I've seen this year and I can't recommend it enough. My one point of criticism is I felt certain tangents related to Ed Gein and John Wayne Gacy seemed a little out of place and I wasn't sure why they were presented the way they were with such polished detailed flashbacks, but other than that one misstep I really think everyone should see this show.",figurative
"I don't like it. Let me start by stating that I have watched the first 8 episodes of season 1. I don't know if there will be more episodes or more seasons, and I do not care. I don't like the show: it tries too hard to be edgy, the humour is aimed for teens, and there are 3 swear words in each sentence. Also I do not enjoy the whole Hell=good Heaven=bad. With that said, the characters are fine, they go through their arcs and grow. The voice acting is amazing, both in songs and dialogue. And the animations are really well done, especially during 8 episode. A little fast paced, but episodes are only 20 minutes long so it's understandable. I rate it 8/10, even tho it is not my cup of tea.",literal
"What you don't know won't hurt you...? In unrelated news, this historical recounting and fictious addendum does not contain an X-Man, a werewolf nor Blue Moon in its soundtrack, contrary to my expectations! Instead, it's a well-crafted tale loosely based on letters between marquis' involving a Beast, sans Beauty, and the Holy Roman Catholic Church, of all ironies!

Watched in the English dubbed version, the surround sound fight and chase scenes are worth it! Next viewing I will watch in French with subtitles. No matter the language as the fables are universal!

A nice telling of a story, supplied by a mix of voice over, dialogue and amazing visual sequences that put Lord of The Rings to shame! Some wire work that makes The Matrix amatuership, and killer attention to period detail make this film really stand out!

Watch the special feature ""The Legend"" before embarking on this journey for a more comprehensive understanding of a story that undoubtedly has become what its titled in its country of origin; namely: France! No jump scares, though scary stills make this mature viewing friendly!",figurative
"Lots of fun but sometimes makes little sense The beginning, slow, introducing 'thousands' of characters, sets perfectly the mood; the use of music in the plot is great; the actors do a great job (even if I am not of a fan of the need for two Michael B. Jordans (even if he is a great actor); the action is well done.

Not all is perfect, though, as the characters behave erratically, suiting the necessities of the plot more than behaving coherently. The change of pace can also be jarring. And even if the movie is more than two hours long, you might feel more advantage could've been taken from the amazing set up. But with so great music, so good all the elements (direction, acting, photography...), you will probably not care. Ryan Coogler has done a very good movie.",literal
"You just need to know when to stop I decided to quit this show after Alex Karev left. The way they wrote him out of the show is ridiculous, but okay. I watched way too long. The first 5 seasons were great, then one by one actors from the original crew are leaving and every time the show just gets worse. And absolute heartbreak is of course Derek's death. The storyline kept getting worse and every season had to have a catastrophic ending that would not be realistic in any other part of the world. The characters are neither growing nor changing significantly. They sometimes sacrifice for the other person, but it's not like they really want it.

As a writer or producer you should know when to stop, before losing audience. Too bad the writers of Grey's Anatomy can't figure it out.",literal
"Great sight gags and double entendres! Accidentally bumped into this when it came on after ""United States of Al"". I'd not heard of it (or the UK version everyone seems so gung-ho on) so I had no preconceived notions about the show. The first episode moved slowly, mainly due to the large cast and their introductions. I've been a fan of Rebecca Wisocki since her Devious Maid days, so it was worth the second look, if only for her role of haughty Hetty, a previous owner of the manor and ancestor of the new owner, Sam.

I appreciate slightly naughty double entendres and I really love sight gags and this show is full of them. The hubby a little inept, but that hole he made in the wall was a set up to a perfect sight gag, and his improvisation of ""fixing it"" made me laugh out loud.

The premise is that Sam inherits a gorgeous manor, and she and hubby go check it out with intentions of selling it. She falls in love with the place and wants to turn it into a B&B, but is unaware that it is very haunted. She then has a near-death experience, which she survives, but this has made her able to see and hear ghosts. She's got quite a crew of creepy-looking spirits in the cellar (they really wish someone would just leave the basement light on!), but the large group that haunts the rest of the place is quite the motley crew.

There's the Viking, Thorfin, who is fascinated by TV; an American Revolution soldier, Isaac, who is very upset over how popular Alexander Hamilton is in the 21st century; Sasappis, a native American; Alberta, a torch singer from the Roaring 20s; the aforementioned Hetty who loves her old home and wants no changes; Flower, the Woodstock era hippie; the eternally sunny Pete, a Boy Scout troop leader who obviously died from an arrow going through his neck; Crash, a leather-clad biker who keeps losing his head--literally--and Trevor, a wolf of Wall Street. We do not yet know how he died but in the afterlife he has no pants on so there's got to be an interesting story there.... All spirits have a special talent, based on who they were or how they died. Isaac died of dysentary, so he is able to create dreadful smells. Alberta has a gorgeous, huge voice and when she sings, some of the living can hear it. Trevor can sometimes move things but he's not really good at it.

We do not yet know all of the ghost's stories or what their special talents are but I am sure the reveals will be quite funny. CBS finally has a great line-up of sitcoms on Thursday, with Young Sheldon, United States of Al, B Positive and now Ghosts. It's worth a watch!",figurative
"Another level of horror movie Exceeding all my expectations, ""Weapons"" is an incredibly powerful film where Zach Cregger masterfully blends tension and dark humor to a new level of sharpness.

The mystery of a mass disappearance and its impact on a small town unfolds in a mesmerizing, layered way, giving each character a chance to shine. The story is divided into several nerve-wracking chapters, ending with a gripping finale.

Special credit goes to Josh Brolin and Alden Ehrenreich, though the entire cast delivers strong, harmonious performances that brilliantly maintain the balance Cregger has created.",figurative
Fantastic I just got out of seeing fantastic four first steps. This movie was awesome. It had a lot of heart a lot of great characters and a lot of stand out moments for each of the four members of the fantastic four. It really showed a great family and it was something that was very fresh and nice to see from the MCU. It really stands out from any of her MCU film as it is in a different world. It is also very intense when it needs to be and like this is a great villain for this movie. Overall very solid eight out of 10.,literal
"Cinematic masterpiece I've thought about it overnight: Wicked: For Good is an excellent film. I teared up several times, though I didn't cry the way I expected-not like I did with the first film. I think a lot of that came from the overwhelming online presence before release. The social-media coverage was unavoidable-trailers, clips, constant discussion-and the overexposure dulled some of the emotional impact. It didn't necessarily show the best parts, but it still revealed more than it should have. Especially if you are a TikTok user.

That said, they absolutely did Dorothy justice. The way she was handled was perfect. The overlapping of wicked and and the Wizard of Oz was seamless. Get you a better understanding on how the stories of Oz merge into one convergence to tell a complete story overall

Recommend. Bring tissues.",figurative
"Excellent fun! Best comedy in a long time.

That's it in a nutshell.

Okay, that's too short according to the rules here.

Someone's finally writing comedy that I can understand. I thought it was a generational thing, where everybody raved about 30 Rock, Parks and Recreation, The Office, and I was just like, I don't get it, must be me.

But now Ghosts and Resident Alien came out, and I feel redeemed.",literal
"Ends before it ends It was entertaining but unfortunately season 1 ends without a real ending. It fells like a series' designed for 8 episodes has run out of money with only a episodes and they just left it off before bringing it to an end. Not acceptable. It's like watching pretty woman for 2 hours and then not knowing if they get together or not. So save yourself the time. It's a shame because the start and idea of the show worked out surprisingly well. Sloppy writing or production, who knows.",literal
"High gloss cheese Back in the day, cheesy action films proved tp be disenchanted and formulaic. While XXX offers a whole new perspective to the action/spy genre, it proves to be nothing but a rebellious version of the latter. Vin Deisel proves he can carry a film with his charisma, but the rest of the film proves to be a big budget B-movie with plenty of cleavage and corny dialogue. While this film is a change of pace, it proves to bring little to the table. I will admit the film was entertaining, but don't expect nothing more than eye candy and dialogue compiled by your typical Hollywood screenwriting hack.",literal
"Did I watch a different movie than everyone else? I started clocking out of Marvel back in 2018, and while Endgame and Spider-Man were exceptions, I've seen only a handful of new Marvel movies in recent years, mostly reserved for things that received good reviews. Fantastic Four is one of these said exceptions.

Is this a bad movie? No. It is perfectly watchable, I enjoyed my time in the theater for the most part. Is it good? ...I'm not sure. There were a lot of things that I enjoyed about the movie, and technically, the movie was on par, but it's just... meh. It's slop. Which is kinda why I'm so shocked to see people hailing this movie as the second coming of the MCU harder than Silver Surfer hailed Galactus in this movie.

After having seen the Superman movie recently, which wasn't perfect either, I think I've realized why ultimately Marvel just doesn't appeal to me anymore. Superman (2025) said something about the world, about life, gave a message, and transmitted an emotion of hope to it's audience. Fantastic Four: First Steps does... nothing of that sort. It says nothing about the world, despite trying to seem like it does, and ultimately just doesn't add anything new to the table, say something meaningful or sincere to the audience.

It's technically good as a film, it's technically fine as a ""story"", but I think people are really holding Marvel to unacceptably low standards at this point. This movie is also not super memorable either. Superman had so many memorable points and lines and characters. Granted, I think the main characters in Fantastic Four were all done well and fleshed out overall, but there was a lot less emotional resonance for me with them. I really liked Sue and Johnny, I think they were knocked out of the park, and Reed was also great, but like... Ben Grimm was just kinda there, half the time.

Galactus as a villain, whilst definitely terrifying and overall done well, I just didn't really care for? Like he's scary sure, but we all know it doesn't matter anyway, this Earth might as well be eaten by Galactus anyway cuz we as the audience know it's all going to go away down the line. I think also just like... this might sound cold or silly, but why should I care about the world whether it gets chomped or not? I have little to no connection to this alternative world, and they may all perish for all I care. It's such a cliche, troped-out thing, and overall, we've seen a lot better from this genre in terms of stakes. Franklin ""DaBaby"" Richards doesn't make for a very compelling plot device as a result in this context, he's just a MacGuffin for the plot to do whatever it wants with him and create a stupid moral quandary over.

Look, this is not a bad movie, but it is slop. It's average, corporate slop without taste, smell, or any sort of spice or meaning. If you enjoy wasting your money and time on Disney's slop, go ahead. I'm tired of it though.",literal
"Funnier Than Expected I have to admit that Ghosts ended up being a lot funnier than I expected. It's based off the UK version of the same name. I never saw the original UK version so I can't compare but this version sure is pretty funny. The entire cast is great and all have their time to shine. Everyone will have their personal favorites though and my favorites are Isaac, Thor and Hetty. Again, they're all funny though and have their moments. The only person on the show I don't find funny and kind of a bad actor is Utkarsh Ambudkar who plays Jay. He's definitely the weak link in the show. He has a few funny scenes here and there but I just don't think he's a good actor. The lead is Sam played by Rose McIver. She makes the entire show go. Listen, this isn't one of my favorite comedies I've ever seen but it's definitely worth the watch.",figurative
"The raft scene was so amazing! It's been 3 years since the last Jurassic film was released and now we have another! This film is a mix of a mission and a trip that lead to survival. It showed how dinos are truly predators and are truly dangerous and not some pets. Only gripe (without mentioning spoilers) is the fact that it could have had more dino action but overall it was good. The character side actually made sense with a group going to the island for a mission while a civilian group just getting to a normal vacation was attacked by spinos and a mososaur. That Rex scene on the raft takes the cake but sadly the raptors were seemingly absent in this film. The score was amazing as they played the original theme couple of times playing homage to John Williams! Was kind of distracted to Scarlett Johansson too but if they could have made this scarier, it would have been loads better.

All because of a snicker bar.",literal
"Jason Clark Murdaughed It! 😳 We all know the story as presented on live TV, a Netflix series and countless podcasts and articles, but Jason Clark's depiction of Alex Murdaugh was definitely the highlight of the series, for moi

Clark transformed into the character and his excellent supporting cast, especially Patricia Arquette, enhanced his performance making the entire production feel genuine, factual and artistic.

It's a frightening, breathtaking true story. Hats off to Hulu for a great production on something we all now know too much about 👏🏽",literal
"One Battle After Another - A Review Nobody Asked For (But Everyone Deserves There are bad movies, there are forgettable movies-and then there is One Battle After Another. A cinematic endurance test disguised as ""comedy"" and ""adventure,"" this nearly three-hour detour into despair felt less like an evening at the cinema and more like a hostage situation where the ransom note was the script.

Leonardo DiCaprio stars, though ""stars"" here is generous. His performance is like watching a Ferrari forced to tow a shopping cart uphill-an expensive engine wasted on the wrong job. DiCaprio has proven himself in great films, but here, he's reduced to little more than a highly paid tour guide through a swamp of half-baked jokes and scenes that stretch on with all the comedic precision of a tax seminar.

The director clearly believed they were making a clever satire. What they actually delivered was a two-hour-and-fifty-minute inside joke that never lands, performed with the solemnity of a Shakespearean tragedy. Imagine someone insisting they're hilarious while reading you a phone book in a dimly lit basement. That's the ""comedy.""

The adventure element? Unless you count the adventure of trying to escape the theater without offending friends who dragged you there, none was detected. Instead, what unfolds is a gloomy parade of clichés, shot with the self-importance of a documentary about rare moss.

Entertainment this is not. In fact, it does the opposite: it drains you. I left the theater feeling not just bored but somehow wronged, as though I'd been promised a fine dinner and served a damp napkin. By the end, I was telling my wife I would have preferred three hours of watching YouTube videos about antique lamps-or even, dare I say, instructional content on carburetor repair. At least those would have provided genuine value.

As for the director, if this was their vision of humor and adventure, one can only hope their next project is less ambitious. Perhaps a silent meditation retreat. With no cameras.

Verdict: One Battle After Another is not a movie-it's a cautionary tale. Save your ticket money, invest in a documentary about garden gnomes, and thank me later.",literal
"Cianfrance continues to Cianfrance You know that feeling after something awful has happened (like a death of someone close to you or someone close to you) where tensions soften, people weaken, and for just a little bit of time, it feels like they're more thoughtful and forgiving when grieving?

That's what Roofman feels like. It's what Frank Capra films feel like. They're humane. You just walk feeling like somebody dialed your empathy up. I'm not big on crime dramas OR comedies-but Cianfrance is just too good at it. The funny is tragic and the tragic is funny, just takes some perspective.

The trailer is selling a much lesser movie, so I highly recommend you watch while you can in the theater. I'm also very surprised that people have knee-jerk takes on this film. It's not a film that leaves any loose ends-but I found the emotional experience of this one so rich, soulful, not neat and tidy-just human!

Cianfrance makes films about ordinary, working-class people who fall into crime and the justice system. Everyone says this is a departure for him. It's more surprising that it isn't. It's very clear to the audience what's coming. The tension is entirely emotional. The final scene is almost spiritual-but only because the non-Tatum characters are religious church-goers. They have grace and dignity. They can forgive. The huge achievement for me is how Cianfrance has made a movie about a goofy & weird & VERY flawed criminal. And allows him the grace that people in real life did. Does it solve world peace? No. But it does what every Cianfrance project does to a point. It makes us think about the huge difference between ""illegal"" and ""unfair.""

Some critics say the film glorifies Jeffrey Manchester. Nonsense. It's a true story that's convenient for Cianfrance to be less of a downer, while keeping his emotional complications. This isn't a film about a rooftop robber. It's a story about how life is really hard enough, it's okay to feel someone maybe didn't deserve to get 45 YEARS.

Tatum and Dunst deserve major awards, which time will look back at kindly because this is a film that will age well. Tatum's best role and performance by a country mile. He's really just very, very good! It still feels like Tatum the action star sometimes, then he starts holding you at an emotional distance. It's so subtle you don't notice the shift.

Kirsten Dunst is, as usual, phenomenal. So grounded, so real. She walks in and you believe her as the character. She just makes it look too easy, there's nothing she can't do. A scene at the end is so authentic, it feels invasive to be watching her.

LaKeith Stanfield was an MVP of the supporting cast for me, but it's a GREAT cast. Great film. Time to revisit some Frank Capra.",figurative
"A gripping thriller **This review may contain spoilers** This show keeps you on the edge of your seat from the first moment. I'm only 3 episodes in and wish that I could see all of them at once, it is that gripping. It makes you want to immediately go straight to the next episode. 

Stana's acting in this may be her best yet, and is quite a departure from her role as Kate Beckett. After playing a much-loved character for 8 seasons, people may think all they'd see in Absentia is Kate Beckett, but that couldn't be further from the truth. Not only are the 2 characters completely different, but one looks and sounds completely different from the other. Just another way Stana has knocked it out of the park with this role. 

Patrick Huesinger is awesome, and you feel so sorry as Nick is pulled in 2 different directions between Emily and Alice, and he makes you root for him when he doggedly tries to find out the truth, even when doing so puts Alice off. When he and Stana are together it's hot. When Emily and Nick are close, steam rises. 

The rest of the cast really round out this show, even Patrick McAuley as Emily and Nick's son, as he reacts to this woman he doesn't really know, then tries to get to know her, ask her questions. And Stana really hits it as a woman who sees someone else raise her child, as she watches them together and when she tries to get closer to her son. 

I've seen the reviews that state the acting is bad, especially Stana's (something about flat beer?), and it's obvious that the reviews were left by bitter fans of Nathan Fillion because such opinions are so obviously not objective given the awesome job Stana, Patrick, and the others have done here. I am bowled over by Stana's portrayal of Emily Byrne, from the get-go, so it boggles the mind that anyone could see this and think it was 'flat', or any other negative adjective. 

This is a dark thriller and not for people that don't like that kind of show, but for those that do - THIS is the show for you.",literal
"Honestly Shocking To See How Poorly The Film Unfolds I had high hopes for this one and listen, it does maintain cinematic quality and is a technically sound film with good performances. Unfortunately though it descends into shame. But such is the story of Katherine Bigelow films. Whether it be Zero Dark Thirty or The Hurt Locker, what appears on the surface is a level of technicality and accuracy that is impressive to the general public, but to anyone who knows anything about the subjects, the films go from quality filmmaking to outright laughable incompetence by the filmmaker. Katherine! You have access to the best expert technical advisors! 80% of it is very accurate, almost to an extreme degree, but the blatant inaccuracies? Stolen story narratives from Dr. Strangelove? Incorrect basic information? And an ending so ambiguous its almost insulting to the viewer? This film is a house of dynamite itself.

A narrative told in 3 major sections from 3 general perspectives, like a puzzle being put together, which I have a strong feeling will be the line for a lot of people. Half will love it and half won't. I personally found it to be a smart idea but executed poorly, the timelines that don't feel lined up like other films who have done this. It doesn't feel cohesive. Wonderful performances from widely loved actors and up and coming stars, all portray a different but semi-universal humanity to what the people handling this situation would go through. However the constant personal phone calls and ""taking a moment"" to breathe is probably a bit too much in some sections. But this is where problems come in, the average viewer will rightfully enjoy the stories of humanity and feel the weight of decisions and results. But anyone who knows even the slightest about this wont be able to take it seriously, and much like her previous films, we will spend the next several years picking it to shreds.

Listen... ICBMs don't fly that low or slow, it would take considerably longer for one to land in Chicago than what is stated in the film. A nuclear detonation of any kind in Chicago would not result in 10 million deaths, the city only has 2.7 million people in it, and not even half that number would be instantly killed. And yeah I'm gunna spoil it because you are hate reading this and have already seen it, if you're gunna be ""brave"" and make a nuclear war movie at a time when that could really happen, show the city of Chicago getting nuked. Don't chicken out at the last second and have us left with literally nothing. No scenes of a nuclear detonation, no reason this is happening, not even showing the US President's decision. Sure some of the best films ever made have ambiguous endings. But that was at such a profoundly insulting level, you'll feel like you just got cheated on by your spouse.

Just go watch Threads, or The Day After, or even Dr. Strangelove because even an absurdist comedy is more accurate. Described by high level government officials of the 1960's as a horror movie because it really could happen like that.",literal
My Review of FBI I really like the show. Mostly love the cast. I also love FBI: Most Wanted. I believe Jeremy Sisto yells because he is in a large room with a bunch of people to talk to and get pumped up. It happens at many sales jobs to get people pumped up. I wish more people liked it. There are so many other shows that should not be on tv but they still are. Why not give this one more of a chance? It's still new.,literal
"Love, Billy Bob I only watched the series because of Billy Bob Thornton. After watching him in Goliath. I had to watch this series.. I know people are complaining about the ex-wife,Ali Larter. I think she's great in this show and adds a little something to the story. The only problem I have is the daughter who is only supposed to be 17 years old and is always dressed half naked around her dad and his friends which is inappropriate. She also seems like her mother's best friend and not mother and daughter. Besides that, it's a really interesting story and I can't wait for the next season. I also love John Hamm and his wife has played by Demi Moore but she's really not in it a lot. I actually didn't recognize her at first. I recommend giving this a try. The acting is fantastic and I will watch anything that Billy Bob Thornton is in.",literal
"Season 3 is a major letdown While season 1 and 2 were both innovative and intriguing, season 3 is just soooo boring. No exciting plots or characters - you just watch it because of the achievements of season 1 and 2. I know they are building up the tension for the grand final, but it's not fascinating, interesting or cringe enough to watch the same disappointment week by week. I personally do not care about anything in this season as it's too late to create a bond between viewer and characters. The suspense is lost in unimportant conversations and plots.

From hotel managers to visitors. It's just less fascinating and captivating now. In season 3 the family isn't interesting, the staff and managers isn't interesting, the story between Belinda and Greg is just stupid, the three girlfriends and there gossip isn't interesting. I will say, that the only thing that's a bit interesting is Ricks unfinished business with Sritalas husband, which has got too little love from the scriptwriter and is therefore also a letdown. Great acting from Sam Rockwell and Aimee Lou Wood.",figurative
"Decent first half, substandard second half I really loved the idea of a series inspired by the troubled teen industry in the 90s. The story was very steeped in 90s/early 00s vibes and made for great nostalgia, mystery suspense/thriller content for the first 3/4 of the series. Around episode 6 it loses that lingering suspense and hurries to get to a finish line in a 2 or 3 episode arc that feels hurried and a bit unpolished.

I see complaints on the acting and chemistry of the main couple. I thought Mae's acting was perfectly fine, even if not award worthy. Their chemistry on screen a little less so, but that bothered me less than the finale.",literal

"good enough What a sad world we live in, the online world is getting really insufferable - this series is barely out and the first reviews here are from people who rage against an actor who happens to be trans.

His performance was very decent btw - he did the best he could with a character that just isn't that deep or developed during the show.

For me personally the show was overall decent due to the very good actors. Otherwise I feel I've seen this subject too much already - in the last years it's all about trauma trauma trauma, manipulation, cults, people being unspeakably cruel.. Although I think it's very good and important these themes are getting attention, I can't stomach another emotionally triggering show or movie.. at this point in time reality is triggering enough..

However i am sure this show will help someone out there..",literal
Season 4 is NOT good Ellen Barkin's acting is terrible this season I assume they are doing the flashbacks so there is less of her on the show but the flashbacks are so boring. Nothing happens anymore...and ridiculous writing. Most likely done with this show.,literal
Great Show- Disappointing Ending This is one of my favorite shows on television. I've been a huge fan since the beginning. The characters had a lot of depth and personality. This played well adding the two prequel shows as well. It went downhill the last season with the hiatus. The ending gave me huge Game of Thrones disappointment flashbacks. The last episode just seemed like a mad rush to wrap everything up. So sad to see such a great show go this route! I wish the creator had put as much effort into maintaining the entire story line as he does making new shows. Maybe Taylor Sheridan needs to finish one project before beginning the next.,figurative
"Sweety, just sit still in the center of the camera, that's great; good girl. Luke Greenfield (Director) brought out his daughter's Potato Head camera to film this for his Jr. High School media production class project. I'd say this was amateur hour, but that wouldn't be fair to toddlers in baby school. What is this?! Was he mad at the studio? I know he's better than this. I mean, not much, but definitely better than this, right?... Right?!

I can't get past the horrible camera decisions. It completely took me out of the 'movie'. How did this get greenlit? I can't be expected to talk about the acting when the basics of filmmaking resemble that of my fourth-grade best buddy and my first attempt at film making. Did he even try? What is this?

How am I supposed to meet the character requirements for this review? It's impossible. I'm stuck on trying to figure out why the camera is 6 inches away from the actors and why every single shot is dead center! Why is modern 'Hollywood' so bad at this!?",literal
"So intense, love the character crossovers Only 2 episodes in and so far I'm loving it. The effects are top notch and I'm enjoying more then the recent IT movies. It's very intense and no one is safe.

Great they managed to get Dick Halloran from The Shining into this series. Sure it's light on details and backstory so far, but if you're watching this you probably already know the lore of IT.

Hoping they can keep ramping up the intensity as the later episodes drop. Love the nostalgia of all the old cars.

Wish there was more good horror tv shows out there. I'm enjoying this for the effects more than anything. Hope they add more backstory in the later episodes.",literal
"Doc is a standout new entry in the medical drama genre. Fox TV's Doc is a captivating new medical drama that blends intense medical cases with emotional storytelling.

Parker and Vann deliver standout performances, bringing depth, vulnerability, and chemistry to their roles. The supporting cast also contributes strong performances, rounding out a team of characters that viewers can root for and relate to. With gripping storylines, well-rounded characters, and a perfect balance of drama and heart, Doc is a refreshing and exciting addition to the medical drama genre. It's smart, engaging, and absolutely worth a watch.

Doc is a standout new entry in the medical drama genre.",literal
"Season 23 is HORRIBLE on so many counts I've been watching Law and Order since it first aired. I've watched rerun after rerun even when I know whodunnit. It's always been a great procedural:thirty minutes devoted to the crime and thirty to the trail and verdict. It's a formula that worked.

I haven't liked the last couple seasons because the format and the scripting and acting wasn't up to par with the series prior to its cancellation, but I watched.

Season 23 is absolutely disastrous! The studio must have stripped them of any budget for this series! Here are my gripes: First: it is obviously not being shot in New York. How do you NOT film in New York? New York is a character, not just a setting! It adds flavor and realism. It's all interior shots now. If they ARE filming in NYC, then they're leaving out the biggest character of the show!

Second: the writing is juvenile. I doubt any seasoned writers are used on this show now. The writers are given a basic idea and then a template for what they must include and whatever they churn out is good to go without any script reviews or revisions. Sure the previous series wouldnt stand up to reality, but at least my five year old wouldn't say,""they don't really do that do they?"" Plot lines are so simplistic that it's ridiculous. The previous series had some twists and turns and banter between prosecution and defense but that is all missing here.

Third: the actors and the acting. THIS is where I really doubt that this series is shot in NYC.

Jerry orbach Tovah Feldshuh Chris Noth Patty Lupone and far more than I can name here were all Broadway actors. They could act! They could deliver lines and would make even idiotic dialogue better by speaking it.

Hugh Dancy seems to be the sole British actor who cannot act.

Sam Waterson is so decrepit that they are finally taking his character off the show( I'm surprised he's able to stand - and don't get me wrong- I loved Waterson and I know they pulled him in to make the transition from the previous series to this new one). But the poor guy is struggling.

The cops and their lieutenant are so NOT in sync with each other. They are stiff and have zero chemistry. This is especially evident in that they recast the one cop before this season. His character was just too objectionable.

The courtroom: I loved how the previous series had a regular rotation of actors playing judges. This series has no such thing and this is also especially where the acting and poor writing show up the most.

Supporting characters: where are they? Where is Dr Olivet? Where is my wonderful female Medical Examiner or the nerdy but cute lab technician? Where are the Yiddish and Russian accents delivered from capable stage actors? In the last episode some guy was supposed to be a big deal Irish actor in the show but his accent was so bad that it shifted from Irish to Scottish to generic British to mid American all in the same scene. Why not hire someone who can act? There were season after season of episodes where the same actor played the victim and the criminal and a supporting part and a lawyer and it was AWESOME because they could act and you knew that you were watching a cadre of NY actors. This new series is so streamlined by poor writing (and I'm guessing : lots more commercials which reduce time) so much so that there is nothing left to provide depth and nuance.

After Waterson is retired next week, I don't see any reason to continue watching. Dick Wolf may have raised the dead but he certainly isn't keeping his creation alive any longer. It's a shame it was not allowed to die on a high note as it had rather than resurrect a monstrosity.",literal
THE BEST EVER This is is honestly the best one ever. Old school comedy with a drizzle of thrilling experience in it. Selena Gomez's sarcastic role and the 2 comedy legend's old school humor is just perfect. Three of them remain to be the main character there's no overshadowing each other here and I'm loving it. A MUST WATCH.,figurative
"Task: Gritty, Gripping, Excellent Task is a phenomenal crime drama from the creator of Mare of Easttown. This excellent show is a deep dive into the lives of two desperate men in Pennsylvania: Mark Ruffalo as an FBI agent and Tom Pelphrey as a family man turned criminal.

It's a relentless, character-driven cat-and-mouse game anchored by superb performances. Bleak, authentic, and emotionally heavy, Task is an essential watch for fans of intense, top-tier crime storytelling. You simply can't get enough of it.",literal
"Pleasantly Surprised & Beyond Satisfied I will likely never really understand the sentiment that Black Phone 2 is an ""unnecessary sequel""...at face-value, yes, it appeared it would be! I get that. But once you see the movie? That goes right out the window, and you're immersed into what I believe is almost the polar opposite of an ""unnecessary sequel"". This one improves upon the first in almost every aspect, and I loved the first film! But this one is a bit better, in my opinion. If you enjoyed the first film, and you're ready for the story to begin fleshing out even more...check this sequel out and give it a chance!",literal
"the first season is brilliant, the second is a waste... I really enjoyed the US version of Shameless Season 1, good humor, interesting characters, I watched all episodes in one day, really breathtaking and enjoyable experience, it became one of my favorite series to date. I have never been a great fan of William H. Macy's roles but I feel he has born to be Frank Gallagher in Shameless. So I recommend season 1 for anyone who want to spend some good time. Season 2 is really uninteresting, as if I am watching a completely different show with different plot and characters. I was really eager to find out what happens with the Gallaghers next, but not anymore. The jokes are not funny, the drama is boring and cliché",figurative
"Very good show with puzzling end Nurse Jackie is a good comedy because it is based on real life and nothing is more funny, horrible, tragic, {adjective here} than real life. Jackie is a great nurse who is not open to personal relationships even though she has the compassion of 100 people (making her a great nurse). She treats herself like crap while her patients get her best. Problem is she is hooked on pills. Pain killers seem to be the drug of choice but she isn't super particular just has the tolerance of a horse. She chomps down 80-100 mg oxy pills like a kid does gummy bears. She chews and snorts them to get the maximum effect from the dosage. Challenge is that this makes her an addict which comes with all the character flaws of an addict; lying, stealing, etc., doing anything to prevent running out of drugs. I think they go a little light on the severity of detox the few times she does. She has herself convinced that she does a better job when high, not an unusual self perception for an addict. The show has a lot of plot lines that take us through a well written story of her life and the supporting cast; mostly her co-workers at a city hospital's ER (which throws in its own set of funny and gross situations). Bad doctors accidentally killing people or being prevented from killing them through the nurses help. Some of the doctors grow and become good while others don't, but it is part of the humor.

Jackie bottoms out, losing her family, children and almost her job; the thing that is more important to her than anything but her drugs. That pushes her to get sober and then use again in the hell of faking sobriety. They don't really inject a lot of 12 step BS. in the show. But that is because Jackie does go through detox for a couple of weeks and say she is in recovery but doesn't actually participate in recovery to where she even knows how the program works. She is though a master manipulator and the show entertains as she jumps through ever increasingly difficult hoops to keep her supplied with drugs and working. She has one person she seems to truly care about, but even that is questionable. When he throws himself under the bus to protect her from prosecution she reacts by rejecting him because it messes with her drug source.

The show evolves over the seasons but the underlying story is that of an addict getting increasingly worse providing a lot of laughs in the process. You can't help but love her flaws and all because you are seeing life through her eyes. The end is tough. Having again dodged a bullet successfully keeping her nursing license by completing a probation program disaster strikes. A dealer who had his stash stolen runs into the ER with a gun looking for it. A doctor talks him out of believing the thief is there and he runs off. But Jackie realizes the likely culprit is a reoccurring character that comes into the ER with a heroine OD because it explains why the dealer would think the thief was there. In this final episode and scene Jackie realizes this guy would do such a thing and runs into the men's room finding our junkie with the huge stash he stole. She takes it from him ,saves him and sets him up in the ER. This occurs during a celebration for the ER treating their last patient and locking their doors (as the hospital is shutting down having been sold to be converted to condo's). She slips into the bathroom and snorts a big pile of the heroine she stole from the addict. At this point she appears to walk out of the party in a euphoric state and go join a large group of people in times square in meditation appearing like the show was ending with her getting worse and moving on... but then suddenly we are back in the ER where all her friends are trying to revive her as she really came out from snorting all the heroine and collapsed. The show then ends with her staring into the camera as we fade to credits unsure if she got revived or died from an OD. Something for fans to debate. I took it as her dying. Either way it signaled the end. Either her life ended or her addiction ended because she couldn't have O.D.'ed and continued on to her next job as a nurse as she would have lost her license after a heroine OD and her life would have been forever changed thus killing the character. Little difference as she either died or the character died thus ending the story.

Great show with a lot of realism that goes where most don't with an ending leaving questions that regardless of the answer lead to the same ultimate end for those who understand the path of addiction. Good writing and a painful subject turned into great entertainment taking a horrible subject and making us laugh as we go along for the ride. Unusual and I'm sure for many who don't know the realities of addiction much of it likely lost on them. But the show is top notch regardless of the viewers knowledge. Though based on the popularity enough people have been touched by the disease to know enough to get it... and getting it is worth the trip!",literal
"Not Bad Good but not amazing, quite funny at times but often since it's target audience is definetly not me I can't ultra critic it but for me it was slightly good could be a bit funnier and a bit less of a generic cringy high school movie and cater to all audiences a bit more and it would be great. Those were the only 3 problems.",literal
"Amazing! I love every episodes, looking forward for season 2.",literal
"It's hard to get past Kristen Wiigs bad accent Just the opening credits set us on edge as we watched the opening, and my wife and I looked at each other and asked the question ""Is she going to sound like that the entire show?"". Answer is yes.

It's a pretty rehashed story, and there isn't a lot of originality to the story, but it's reasonably well done and there certainly are some great talents attached to the show and the costume team set teams did a great job nailing the period.

Other than that, if your bored or not watching anything else of note then it's a really good way to kill some time, but there are other shows that you would get more out of.",literal
"Outstanding Series, with a SUPERB cast! One thing I love about this series is the characters. When the trio are always together, they create chemistry. I have to commend Selena's brilliant performance here. I thought that choosing Selena Gomez as a co-lead actress with the comedy legends, will not work very well. However, I underestimated this woman and turns out she's doing what I want her to do. Never expected to love this show at first, but I'm saying it right now - watching this show is a must. It is definitely one of the best shows released by HULU and one of the best TV shows of this year!",literal
"One of the better shows out there Glad they are making another season. Most of the shows today are watered down and it's hard for me to connect to a lot of these shows but this show is what I call perfect casting, great story line, & a lot of humor in it. The acting is amazing in this and if you remember Adam Brody in the OC his acting/character in this reminds me of his acting/character in that series. I could see this show go on for many years if they keep this up. The whole cast does an impeccable job and they are bring their own unique twist to the show and you can't help but like all the characters and their quirks. Can't wait for season 2.",literal
"A mystery horror with both recommendable qualities and structural flaws Thanks to a memorable and creepy viral marketing campaign showing kids running away at 2:17 a.m., Zach Cregger's sophomore feature has been highly anticipated. I will admit that I wasn't a huge fan of ""Barbarian,"" but I really like the cast of this (especially Josh Brolin) and was intrigued by both the idea of a ""Magnolia""-style character piece providing complimentary perspectives on the unfolding events, as well as the fact that this might be more of a mystery/thriller than just a straightforward horror film, so I was still intrigued. Ultimately, I thought ""Weapons"" was better than ""Barbarian"" but still a bit of a mixed bag for me.

The story starts right as the kids are running away. Soon after that, it moves towards a chapter-based structure, with each chapter telling its turn of events from a different person's perspective. It's not an anthology film of course, just a not-totally-linear (plenty of things get re-explained) but ultimately connected structure that some viewers might find to have some similarities with ""Pulp Fiction."" This style has both pluses and minuses, both on Cregger's filmmaking techniques and viewer engagement with and understanding of the larger narrative. It creates a unique and more character-driven environment than the typical horror movie (although the characters aren't entirely as deep or unique as Cregger thinks they are,) but the constant need to repeat or re-explain certain types of information can occasionally feel tedious. To his credit, Cregger does build a creepy atmosphere effectively--at least for the first two-thirds of the movie. The first half or so isn't completely filled with horror scenes, but the horror scenes that they are during these parts are effective. There are some jump scares in those moments, but Cregger wisely doesn't overdo it on those and still builds an effectively tense and nightmarish atmosphere during those (sometimes-brief) moments.

The performances are generally solid across the board, and the cinematography and score are generally well-done. Yet the bigger concern with ""Weapons"" is that the third act isn't as compelling as the first two. In some ways, it (and its impact on the central mystery at hand) felt to me like a cop-out, but those who are horror fans will like it more. Ultimately, I found this to be a film with compelling sections that are worthwhile, but also some more uneven and disjointed material. 6/10.",literal
Excellent Seeing a lot of negative feedback on this programme. But for me it's probably one of the best shows in a while. The 2 lead Characters are excellent. The supporting cast are excellent.,literal
"Promising idea sunk in key areas ""Now You See Me"" came out of nowhere and became the sleeper hit of 2013, getting good word of mouth during its theatrical run. Having seen the movie for myself, I am kind of puzzled by its popularity. Certainly, the movie is far from the worst movies I have ever seen - it's colorful, and doesn't have a dead spot despite running almost two hours long. 

But there were some things about the movie that annoyed me enough to prevent me from liking it. The biggest problem is with the characters. Except for Freeman's character, there is not one likable character in the movie. The law enforcement agents investigating the magicians are loud and obnoxious, and the four magicians come across as extremely smug. (Also, there is no attempt to give the magicians real and separate personalities - they all act alike.)

The characters were the main reason why I didn't like this movie, but there were other problems as well. One other major annoyance is the depiction of the magic acts. They have been jazzed up with CGI and other special effects so they don't feel like REAL magic acts - they come across as artificial. Also, as the movie progresses, the various feats the magicians pull off slowly become more unbelievable (and not fully explained) that eventually I wanted to cry out loud, ""Oh, COME ON!"" Less slight of hand and a more realistic approach would have been a much better approach.

(Note to Michael Caine fans: His role is really just an extended cameo appearance.)",literal
"Deep topic, brilliant approach I loved this movie, without question. But not in a be crazy about it way. In a slow, deep, emotional way. Lucy's and Dakota Johnson's vibe compeletely matches with my desires'. It may be surprising, but most of the times, I agreed with her - even with her seemingly materialistic approach.

One of my favourite things about this movie were the quiet, calm dynamics. Even when there was a breakup and harassment, even when they were shouting and fighting, somehow the story stayed quiet and deep.

I couldn't really symphatize with John's character, but I respect his attitude. He was a huge fighter, who didn't give up on love, even when the materialistic questions were tearing them apart.

I strongly hope, that we, in real life, can slowly change how people look at themselves and eachother. Because, as Sophie L. Said: I am not a merchandise, I am a person. And please, think of this all the time, even when you're more than 25, even when maybe you weigh a little bit more than you wish you would, you are still a person, and there is always one person who loves and takes care of you - and that is the one you see when you look at the mirror.",literal
"Can't judge this with only 2 episodes Even though I wish they had tried to change it up a bit more, the first two episodes are just an introduction to the show and I'm hoping with episode 3 it'll stand on its own. The potential is there because the ghosts and their histories will be different at least. Some of the charm of the main plot jokes fell flat (or just oddly done) with what they tried to capture or duplicate from the UK version, but other more tailored jokes (specific to these new ghosts) show potential. Hoping now that they've established the premise it'll take off with more original jokes and stories. Parts with this ensemble felt like they were really trying too hard... and at a rushed pace. Looking forward to ep3 though to get a better impression.",literal
"A show that's not sure what it wants to be This had the potential to be an amazing thriller but the narrative is flawed. The work of Emma Thompson and Ruth Wilson is excellent, and story setting Oxford is really intriguing. Here it's a thriller with some comedic moments.

But the acting and story line of the intelligence services in London is totally mismatched - it's almost as if it's from a different show. The change in tone is very jarring and totally misjudged in my opinion. It detracts from some of the tragic moments elsewhere in the show.

That being said it's a good story and I look forward to the rest of the episodes. Both Emma Thompson and Ruth Wilson have some great acting moments.

It's just a shame that the producers and writers couldn't agree on the style.",literal
"Well that went downhill quick. If I reviewed this show in the first 6 or 7 seasons I would've given it at least 8/10, first 5 seasons would've been 10/10. I started watching Shameless from the very first episode and got hooked, which is why it gets at least a 5. Now it's so full of random try-hard comedy and edginess that it clearly shows they're running out of any good ideas. It just keeps getting worse and worse with every episode. So disappointing knowing how great this show used to be. Needs to get back to its roots instead of constantly using CNN's talking points to show how PC and ""woke"" they are, along with saying ""I'm southside, this is southside, that's southside, welcome to southside"" to explain every crazy thing they do. It's almost unbearable making it through to the end of each episode. Showtime isn't worth the $10.99 a month, and Shameless was the only reason I kept it (canceled it tonight), and now I wouldn't pay $1 a month for it. I'll stop here but I could go on about how upsetting this show has become.

Advice: wait for Shameless to end completely and watch it on Netflix.",figurative

"Pathetic copy of a fantastic Italian drama As a first generation Italian that enjoys watching both Italian and American shows I was really hopeful for this remake of the astounding Nelle Tue Mani Italian show. The original is captivating, reels you in deeper with every episode, has multi-dimensional characters and phenomenal acting. This series premiere episode of Doc was a sore disappointment. The acting is comically bad, the feel is much too soap opera, and the characters are stereotypical and, frankly, unlikable. Perhaps I am clouded by having watched the original and an American audience may enjoy this more having nothing to compare it too. Unfortunately, I was just cringing the whole time watching this. Really disappointing.",literal
"Overrated is an Understatement After hearing all my (former) friends rant and rave about this ""smart, edgy, hilarious comedy"" that I just NEEDED to check out, I decided to give this show a try. Note that this is shortly after marathon-ing through some great TV shows like Breaking Bad which is actually a smart show. Anyway, 10 minutes into the first episode I was bored out of my skull with the already repetitive and awkward humour. But, I knew that 10 minutes of one episode was not enough to judge a show by. So I watched the 1st season and a half and I can say not once through those 25 episodes did I even come close to cracking anything that even slightly resembled half a smile. It is the same sitcom show we've seen for the past 40 years disguised as a quirky show filled with intelligent characters. I've read a lot of the other reviews on here and a lot of them agree with the statement that this is not a quirky or even slightly smart show. The demographic it appeals to are brain-dead teenagers who think that when the extremely unfunny Jim Parsons says a few big words, it is the most hilarious thing there has ever been. Strip away the incredibly simple Star Wars references and the mumbled soliloquies of Parsons and what's revealed is a below average sitcom decades behind its time filled with unlikable characters. It baffles me how people can enjoy a single episode of this nonsense, never mind call it a ""masterpiece"". Use the term ""comedy"" very loosely when describing this trash.",figurative

"When promises fail What amounts to approx 6.5 hours of made up cheaply fabricated sections of tension: creeping around old buildings, woods, tunnels, etc, etc. This series could easily been condensed into a 50 minute film but even that would have been a rip-off.

One reviewer had claimed that if you liked the Tunnel or the Bridge series, you'd like this. I did very much like those series but found Absentia nothing like them. My attention can often be grabbed. I was hoping someone would come up with the goods - something, anything... from either the script writer, the director or at least one of the actors but nadda.

This series (for me) was a complete let down. The concept could have been born from a kids story. Well done kid - I'm not knocking you, the script writer's to blame. The director, well they must have been drowning their sorrows in the hotel bar. The actors..... Move on, there are better rolls to play.",literal
"Pacing Stumbles Aside, This Netflix Noir Has Teeth Black Rabbit is the kind of dark, moody drama Netflix does well when it trusts its stars.

With Jude Law and Jason Bateman front and center, the show explores brotherhood, guilt, and survival with an unsettling intimacy. From the first episode, it's clear this is more a psychological character piece than a straight crime thriller.

Law is outstanding- hollowed-out, calculating, but still human. Bateman complements him with controlled fury and quiet despair. The direction and tone are cinematic, full of shadows, silences, and moral fog. What sometimes falters is pacing: several episodes spin in place or juggle too many plotlines at once, diluting the tension.

Still, when Black Rabbit clicks (especially in its first and penultimate episodes) it's gripping. The final twist delivers emotional weight, even if the ending drags a little.

It's uneven, yes, but also one of the year's more memorable Netflix originals. 7.5/10.",literal
"Not passable The best thing I can say about this movie is that its opening sequence had Rammstein playing ""Bang Bang"" and that was supposed to be the xXx theme song, to much embarrassment. But the movie itself sucks a lot. It tries to be a James Bond with a bad ass flavor but actually fails miserably. Some of the action scenes are actually quite well scripted and I would'nt be surprised if others found them to be excellent but the way they've been executed makes them plain boring and one could even fall asleep. The story is the standard bad guy wants to destroy xyz place using nuke/bio/chem weapons. The villains come across as idiots and Vin Diesel sucks in his role.",literal
"Funny, Charming, Yet Familiar 7/10 Another solid Regal Mystery Movie. The film centers on the idea of the afterlife, and who to spend it with, and where. For all eternity. There's a lot of fun creativity throughout, but the plot treads on too familiar ground.

Positives!

+Main trio does a great job. Miles Teller really captures that old man in a young mans body.

+DaVine Joy Randolph and John Early provide great comedic relief without undercutting the heart.

+Novel view of the afterlife.

+Great set design.

Negatives!

-Romcom tropes are here unfortunately.

-Ending was predictable.

-Missed opportunity to elaborate on the negative memories that were glossed over.

I was surprised that I liked this one so much. There's enough thought provoking scenes to make you analyze your own life. Plenty of humor. Plenty of emotion. Perfect for a date night, or a solo viewing. 7/10.

"It must be bots giving it such a high score. I have no idea why this movie got so many good reviews. For sure, it's bots as the movie was nowhere near as good as it's being made out to be.

Terribly written, where at times the plot just wanders aimlessly, and the characters had little depth.

The music score was terribly irritating with a constantly repetitive, annoying piano.

My biggest criticism is that this is pure and utter Hollywood over-the-top DEI.",literal
"Great performances This film is a relentless descent into tension, sorrow, and flat-out misery. To me, it had the feeling of an old war movie, with young men marching, putting one foot in front of the other, and a lot of uncertainty about what lies ahead of them. All the necessary ingredients-pride, wrath, greed, bravado, and even kindness-are showcased by a cast of outstanding young actors. You are there with them every step of the way, getting to know these characters, growing attached, laughing, weeping alongside of them, and as quickly as some are introduced, they're gone. We the audience remember why we are all here, and the walk continues with our newly found comrade being left behind. Adding to the tension is a psychotic Major who acts like a sick and twisted game show host, constantly appearing with a bullhorn to remind everyone of the deadly consequences of failing to maintain the desired pace. It's a brutal and on-brand reminder of the rules.

While the film is emotionally devastating, it is also a dystopian thriller filled with grotesque imagery. Some moments are not for the squeamish, but it's a solid, must-watch that will keep you engaged from start to finish. The compelling performances will have you constantly concerned for each character's fate.",literal
"Well written, accurate portrayal of metoo situations Apart from the fairly realistic corporate power exchange (backstabbing and creating useful alliances etc), the violated female victim situation is incredibly well portrayed- such a highly delicate and complex emotional experience, both explored in the views of the victim and the perpetrator. Amazing and well done. Men who don't understand why women don't ""fight harder"" for help, watch this.",literal
"Love it! The first time I tried to watch it, I quit halfway through the first episode and didn't think I'd like it. Keri Russell's character was just so off-putting and unlike anything else I've seen her in. Gave it a second try a year later and am so glad I did. I get to binge two seasons just before a third season drops. Yay me!",literal
"Well done but transitionally abrupt. Love the show. Only issue I would have is a lot of end of season random drops of the ball. Characters disappear randomly. I do appreciate the crisis and addiction storylines taken head on, but some seasons seem more important to the show runners than others. Ultimately Nurse Jackie is about how you have to live as obstacles arise then go on no matter what. Merritt is a treasure in this show and is proving that again in shows like Godless. Nurse Jackie is a quick binge style show. Quick episodes with some medical but this is more about the people than any deep dive into the medical profession. It is a drama set at a hospital, not a drama about a hospital.

Worth your time.",figurative
"Down the Black Rabbit hole I binge watched this over a #10 typhoon and it's not easy because the story is tight and it doesn't leave room for you to come up for air. It is very, very good but I can also see there are elements in there that if it is in the wrong hands, it could turn up to be a mediocre soap, maybe even a slightly soggy one, but thank God it isn't. Everyone in it is fantastic. Of the two leads and mostly because of their performances, this becomes something that is on a different level, and between them two, Jude Law and Jason Bateman, I think Jason took the lead and win by the tip of his nose this time. Quite a few fantastic choices that are worth watching for, the Mancuso character being a mute is for one. That alone transformed the meeting scenes into something very unique to watch. All in all, it is a slow pressure cooker of a story with some excellent ingredients inside, and no matter how the thumb screw is being turned, the unwavering bond between brothers could be the secret from an 'original sin'. Anyway, maybe ""Down the Black Rabbit Hole"" could have been the title because that's where everyone was going. Highly recommended.",literal
"LOVE LOVE BUT BRUSH HER HAIR! We love this show! Everything about it is fabulous. The sets, especially, are beautifully done. Dialogue by all is crisp, snappy & very-- diplomatic. Mdm Ambassador dresses very severely without fancy clothes or makeup which fits her character perfectly. My only complaint is please, Ambassador Wyler needs to brush her hair.",literal
"Interestingly eccentric blend of horror, period piece and martial arts - but it loses a lot of steam towards the end The Beast of Gevaudan roamed the region for three years in the mid-18th century, killing 80 - 100 people in this time range and prompting the king to call upon numerous hunters to track the beast and kill it.

To this day, the Beast is an unsolved mystery. Some claim it was a deranged wolf with a blood lust (since it rarely ate its victims and would instead crush their skulls with its jaw), while others believe it was an extinct species of hyena. Others believe the beast has been exaggerated over the years and it could have merely been an escaped lion. Then there are those who believe it was a trained creature working with a human counterpart - an early serial killer using an animal to help him kill.

The movie is interesting because, like Mark Pellington's ""The Mothman Prophecies,"" it takes an engaging urban legend and instead of trying to find any direct answers or make it a film entirely _about_ the creature itself, it uses the backdrop as a means to explore other elements.

""Le pacte des loups"" (The Brotherhood of the Wolf) takes the story of the Beast of Gevaudan and twists it around quite a bit. Some of it works well - the mix of period piece and action movie is a nice blend - but particularly towards the end, once it turns into an unbelievable Jet Li-style martial arts flick, it goes down an awkward path and ruins a lot of what it has already established. It's the one thing that pushes the genre-bender over the edge and it really does feel too bogged down by that point. Also, the revelations during the finale - involving the beast and the plot behind its motivations - are fairly weak.

However, the setup is fine, and the movie is an interesting oddity: a weird little mix of genres that offers a bit for everyone, even if its ending is a let-down.",figurative
"A solidly entertaining film An ex soldier turned gold miner hits the motherlode and swiftly has it taken from him by raging German soldiers. He sets out to recover his gold and seek revenge.

That's the basic plot, and if I was to describe tone and direction and story, think Fury, meets Die Hard, starring John Wick, set in Spaghetti Western land.

There's so many plot holes that you can't keep count. And yet you forgive every single one. Even where he is left hanging and to survive he rests his weight by letting a steel bar enter the bullet wound in his leg, to take the weight from his neck. He still manages to sleep though.

Apart from the odd inspired scene there's very little decent acting, but even that's not off putting. The Good The Bad and The Ugly. Who really cared? The films are legend now.

Anyway, it's very entertaining and I watched it start to finish in one sitting, not a common thing for me, and I really enjoyed it's dated and yet modern appeal.",literal
"Different take on a standard horror trope 'Sinners' starts in a church, but doesn't spend too long explicitly focusing on religion, god and the devil - but does explore these themes in the semi-segregated world of 1932 Mississippi. We start with Sammie/""Preachers Boy"" (Caton) and then are introduced to his notorious cousins who have just returned from Chicago - twins Smoke & Stack, both played by Jordan, who clearly relishes the run he gets to have. He plays them both subtly different enough that you can tell who's who.

It all occurs in one day, with the first hour setting the scene well, as we're introduced to ex-girlfriends - Mary (Steinfeld) and Annie (Mosaku) - plus Slim (Lindo) and Cornbread (Miller), who are brought in to help Smoke & Stack open up their ""Juke"" bar. Key to everything is Sammie, his guitar and the blues. We're then introduced to Remmick (O'Connell), who is a charming Irishman, hiding a sinister secret.

I won't spoil the twist, but it doesn't take long for the film to turn to a horror, and does well to start off with a bit of tension and suspense and then go full blown bloody action/fight/gore. Holding it together is the great soundtrack and score, with the music great throughout. Just over 2 hours, but never boring - solidly wrapped up, some great scenes. Stay after the initial credits, as there's a ~5min final scene.",figurative
"Outstanding Well first of all I don't think you could have gotten anyone better than Billy Bob Thornton. The first episode right in the beginning you got me nervous and a little bit scared. They have an absolutely incredible script. I don't know how to say it but it keeps you hooked to the screen that's for sure. This series I can already tell it's going to be the number one hit no doubt about it wow wow oh wow!! There's not much more to say, except this,this will keep you stuck to your seat the whole hour. It seemed like 10 minutes went by and yet it was already an hour had gone by and it was over. I wanted more. Don't miss the series.

"New special agent in charge sucks The way they have written the new special agent in charge's character sucks. They have written it so that it appears that the new leader comes in with chip on her shoulder. Instead of coming in and getting to know the agents under her, she threatens them if they disagree with her. Over compensating much. More likely to drive off viewers than draw them in if they don't change this character's approach quickly. This type of character didn't work on NCIS LA & it won't work here.",literal
"Leave it to Hollywood execs to ruin a classic... Well, I went to go see this one out of pure curiosity and a hopefulness that maybe, just maybe, this would be like the original that was actually very good. Don't misunderstand me here, the acting was great, and the set design was awesome, but it is missing that certain feeling that makes the Grinch, the Grinch. I do suggest that you go and see this one, especially if by some chance you have not seen the original, or you just want to do something fun for an afternoon.",literal

Not sure why I clicked on it but I did not really expect much but I am absolutely loving it. In a TV movie and TV landscape full of remakes, prequels and sequels this is so creative and refreshing. I loved all the characters in the first episode and the music is outstanding and meaningful. I am preying people find the show and it does well.. so we get more. I have to say Amazon is killing it at the moment with so many good shows being introduced or expanded upon. More creative content like this, please and thank you.",figurative
"A Step Ahead By 1977, Stephen King was rapidly becoming a household name, with the best sellers 'Carrie', 'Salem's Lot' and 'The Shining' making him one of the horror genre's rising stars. Success, however, brought limitations. At the time, publishers believed the public wouldn't accept more than one book a year from a single author, and King's output far outpaced that rule. To sidestep it- and to see whether his popularity came from genuine talent or just luck- he adopted the pseudonym, Richard Bachman. Bachman became both an experiment and an outlet, a shadow identity that allowed King to publish more freely without diluting the value of his established brand.

Bachman's second novel, 'The Long Walk,' was first published in 1979, though written years earlier while King was a freshman at the University of Maine. Set in a near-future America, it follows a group of young men competing in a brutal annual contest where they must keep walking above a set pace- or face execution.

A kind of science-fiction allegory for the Vietnam War draft, it resists being pinned down to a single reading, and has long tempted filmmakers. George A. Romero was first attached to direct in the late 1980s, but the project never materialized. Years later, Frank Darabont- who successfully adapted King's 'The Shawshank Redemption,' 'The Green Mile' and 'The Mist'- also took a crack at developing it, though his version likewise stalled in development. Finally, in late 2023, it was announced that Francis Lawrence had assumed directorial duties, working from a screenplay by JT Mollner.

Lawrence's film is a strong, faithful adaptation of the source material, capturing both its relentless tension and thematic depth. Although somewhat mischaracterized as a horror, the film is consistently unsettling, immersing viewers in a dystopian world where brutality and violence are commonplace. Much like the novel, it aims to explore themes of conscription, authoritarian control and the expendability of youth, while also serving as a pointed critique of capitalism and the societal pressures that pit individuals against one another.

However, while 'The Long Walk' gestures toward these themes, Lawrence rarely probes them with the depth they deserve, presenting them more as background texture than as active philosophical inquiry. For instance, the spectacle of the Walk itself is ripe for commentary on media voyeurism and desensitization, yet the film stops short of interrogating the audience's complicity or the system's mechanisms of control. It's evocative, but not especially reflective.

Moreover, Mollner's dialogue is occasionally clunky, leaning heavily on overwrought emotional beats. Characters speak less as people and more as thematic signposts, particularly in moments of tension where nuance is sacrificed to reiterate stakes we already understand. Further, the characters themselves are largely archetypal. While this mirrors King's tendency to populate his stories with familiar types, the film does little to complicate or humanize them. Motivations are thinly sketched, emotional arcs predictable. As a result, the titular walk feels less like a descent into psychological horror and more like a grim endurance test with interchangeable figures.

Beyond its narrative strengths and weaknesses, 'The Long Walk' excels in its technical execution, helping to sustain tension and immerse viewers in its dystopian world. Director of photography Jo Willems captures the relentless monotony and oppressive heat of the journey with a stark, unflinching eye. He utilises a muted colour palette- dominated by greys, browns, and washed-out greens- reinforcing the bleakness and brutality of the film's world.

Complementing the cinematography is Nicolas Lepage's minimalist, atmospheric production design. Rather than overbuilding the dystopia, he and his team suggest decay through subtle cues: crumbling buildings, cracked sidewalks, rusted metalwork. The roadside becomes a purgatory, with sparse signage and empty towns evoking both Americana and abandonment. It's not flashy, but its restraint serves the story- though some might wish for a more vivid sense of the society watching from the sidelines.

In addition, Mark Yoshikawa's editing is tight and purposeful, maintaining a steady rhythm mirroring the walk's relentless pace. Most of the film unfolds in linear fashion, enhancing the narrative's sense of inevitability- an endless march toward a conclusion that can only be grim. Jeremiah Fraites' score is subtly atmospheric, simmering beneath the surface like a pulse.

Although saddled with somewhat one-note characters, most of the cast perform admirably. Cooper Hoffman and David Jonsson, as the leading lads Ray Garraty and Peter McVries, carry the weight of the story with impressive intensity, conveying the physical strain and psychological tension of the walk with nuance. Ben Wang steals every scene he's in, while Charlie Plummer makes for an effective young psychopath. Further, Mark Hamill is a gruff delight as the constant-sunglass-sporting Major, who runs the show; someone you'll really love to hate.

In conclusion, while Francis Lawrence's 'The Long Walk' doesn't fully capitalize on the philosophical weight of its premise, it remains a gripping adaptation of one of Stephen King's most haunting early works. Lawrence's direction, paired with strong technical craftsmanship and committed performances, ensures the film leaves a lasting impression- even if it strolls past some of its deeper questions. It's a bleak, relentless journey that, despite its flaws, is a step ahead of many other King adaptations.",figurative
"He Said He'd Be Back...""The Running Man"" is Fun No Matter How You Slice and Dice it... ""The Running Man"" is based on a story by Richard Bachman, a.k.a. Stephen King writing under pseudonym. 

It takes place in the near future, where everything is run by the media and the government. Kind of like right now. In the future, there isn't much selection on television. All there is is ""The Running Man""--hosted by Damon Killian (Richard Dawson, host of ""Family Fortune"" in real life)--a show that features convicts, or ""runners"" being chased by madmen, or ""stalkers."" It's a bit like a futuristic gladiator sport. No one ever, ever wins the show. But Schwarzenegger has yet to play. Arnold Schwarzenegger plays Ben Richards, also known as The Butcher of Bakersfield, for firing upon a crowd of humans in a food strike. Only one problem. He's been framed--he never shot anyone. After Arnie escapes from jail, Damon Killian wants his hands on him for the show--so they hunt him down and bring him in. Damon offers Ben a deal--if he goes on the show, he'll let his friends from jail go free. But if he doesn't...he puts his friends on. So Richards agrees to play the game, only to find that Damon has put his friends-from-jail in the show anyway. Right before being launched in the arena, Ben Richards says to Damon, ""Hey, Damon. I'll be back."" There is a pause. ""Only in a rerun,"" Damon says. Yeah, right.

This movie is about as action-packed and adrenaline-punched an action movie you're going to see in a while. We see an excuse for Schwarzenegger being thrown into an arena with killers, where he must use his brains, strategy, and most of all muscles, to kill the stalkers. But the thing is, the excuse for throwing Schwarzenegger in the arena is a good one. They didn't completely ignore the plot; they don't even throw him in the arena until at least a half hour into the film. They set up the plot first, which is nice.

Arnold proves his acting talent is not just in his muscles once again. Too many people make fun of Schwarzenegger's acting skills, but to tell you the truth, I prefer him over Bruce Willis and Sylvester Stallone any day. Bruce and Sly are mumblers, in my opinion. Anyway, I like Arnold in this movie, because unlike in ""The Terminator"" where he is an indestructible cyborg, he is a vincible human with emotions in this film. We see a different side to Schwarzenegger, and it's pretty nice.

Richard Dawson is surprisingly good as Damon. I love his charisma on screen. Of course he's good at playing a gameshow host--he himself was one--but he also has a very good acting talent. Check out the scene where he offers Arnold a deal for going on the show. Look how smug he is in that scene, and how well he delivers his lines. He envelops his character very well. An underrated actor if ever I saw one. He comes off slightly creepy and slightly likable.

This movie is good fun no matter how you slice and dice it. I've often noticed it has a bit of a weird vibe to it, but then I realized that's just the sci-fi/futuristic vibe of the film. I've felt it before when watching sci-fi films. There's something about them. When I watch a film, or a certain genre, I get different vibes. Sci-fi gives me a weird vibe that is undescribable. This film gives that vibe to me. It sounds weird, but I think a lot of people get ""vibes"" and don't realize it.

I recently viewed this movie twice in less than a day; once at night and once in the morning. It just goes to show how easy it is to watch. It is strictly a fun, action film with lots of imagination and charisma. Easy to watch with a high re-watch factor.

What would you rather do with 90 minutes of your life on a Friday night then watch Arnold Schwarzenegger get to knock some skulls together in a gladiator arena? Exactly.

"Nurse Jackie has left the building I thought season 1 was worth watching that quickly became a lot less. I watched 3 seasons and because nothing really happened at all but some vicissitudes around a junkie who works in the emergency room, I only ventured into season 7. But by then I had already built up a reasonable aversion to nurse Jackie and Eddie and some more people. What a loser Eddie say, yuk. I liked Zoey, Thorn and doctor ohara and some others too.

"Reimagining of the old Canadian TV show ""The Littlest Hobo"" From IMDB :The Littlest Hobo ... A German Shepherd dog wanders endlessly, only stopping to do a good deed or help a person in need, before returning to his road without end. (1963-1965).

I liked Tracker, it brought back good memories of watching The Littlest Hobo when I was a kid in Canada. The character Colton is quite likeable and obviously is haunted by some childhood trauma.

Hopefully the show won't be too formulaic, and can keep itself fresh. Also, I hope that the secondary characters become more developed and prominent in the future episodes. His Toyota truck also looks like a secondary character but know how to stay just in the background.",literal

"After seeing episodes 6x03 and 6x04 it's final:Gandolfini is one of the finest actors of our time! As a guy who has seen all the seasons, I can say that James Gandolfini constantly surprises me. I mean, after you saw him shifting from laughter to paranoia instantly throughout the seasons and after every little gesture of his made you believe he is a gangster, you thought to yourself: OK he is a good actor and he can get into a gangster's skin. But after seeing him - in the beginning of season 6 - opening his eyes and struggling for his life, I mean I could almost feel the pain he ""made"" us believe he was going through. I was so touched by his performance that I immediately thought at Robert De Niro, Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. These guys were definitely the best of their generations and even more. But nowadays they are either old or dead (Brando) and it's OK that they make less movies and their performances are ""lighter"" than they used to be.

"More Generic Than The First Film But Just As Fun As someone who prefers Better Call Saul to Breaking Bad I got a real kick out of seeing Bob Odenkirk in Nobody. It was strange casting in the best way possible and for as simple as it was it was so unbelievably entertaining and it felt like the movie I needed at that time. Having said that though, I wasn't sure how to feel about a sequel given the fact that the original had a bit of a lightning in a bottle quality that wasn't sure they were gonna be able to recapture and after 4 years I just felt the time might've passed. Nobody 2 isn't as good as Nobody 1 but it's a fun ride in the same way that first film was and does just enough of its own spin compared to the first to make it feel worthwhile. Bob Odenkirk is again amazing, the action is great, it works really well as a dark comedy and had a completely bonkers 3rd act to rival that of the first. It just feels a bit generic whereas Nobody felt simple and it can also feel like it's forcing its sentimental elements. Connie Nielsen gets a lot more to do in this movie and I actually liked her presence a lot more as a result but I wished they gave Christopher Lloyd more to do after he was such a stand out last time. For a film I had concerns for I still had a very fun time even if it's a bit of a step down and if they do make a third movie I will definitely watch it.",figurative

The entire cast is perfect for their roles, especially James Gandolfini as Tony Soprano. If it winning a million awards isn't enough for you to watch it then all you have to do is ask anyone who's ever seen it and I guarantee they'll say go watch it immediately.

Leaving my judgement and values at the door, I waded right into the thick of the strangely harmless gunfire, unlikely situations and ho-hum dialogue, and I enjoyed myself thoroughly. I don't care whether Vin Diesel can act or not - and he can, in my opinion - I think he's gorgeous, and he certainly has the physical presence to fill this role with the requisite amount of aplomb. He might be a thug, but he's a thug with a soft voice, bright eyes, and big muscles - and he's perfect as Xander Cage.

"Made me want to bash Carry over the head with a gatrumpet This version of Grinch was a nasty feast I couldn't stand in the least.

This full length high budget extravaganza really has little to offer beyond what the classic cartoon already did so well. Truly, the only good moments are those that are directly taken from the original story. The new material that is added here is simply a montage of misguided, mean-spirited, over-wrought highly intense noise; led by the master of hysterical yelling and screaming for no reason whatsoever, Jim Carry. No moral, no insight, no creativity, no entertainment value. We get some long-winded flap-trap about how mean the Whoville residents are to Grinch. How everybody else disturbed him emotionally etc. etc. ad infinitum, ad-nauseum. Be on the lookout also for subplots about some of the Who's, that are unnecessary, unfunny, and inappropriate. Christmas spirit does not exist in this movie (except in the portion that retreads the original story). Kids will be bored, adults will be annoyed. Any fan of Dr. Seuss's work will be offended.

The actress playing Cindy Lou Who is about the only positive in this film. I realize she was a no more than two, and a nice character, but I kept hoping she'd push the Grinch off a cliff and mercifully end this disaster.

Your heart will not grow three sizes the day you watch this. Stick with the classic cartoon.",literal
"Playdate I laughed out loud more than once. I miss good slapstick. The comedy tone shifts later in the film due to more action, while remaining silly. Acting was spoty, but acceptable. They wasted Sarah Chalke. Nine years on Scrub, she has the chops, just not the scenes. Decent time-waster.

Gave it a 7 to raise it up from a 5.5.",literal
Crafted with passion and heart For an entirely internet produced project it couldnt have been more amazing. Everything from the animation to the voice acting conveys the efforts of everyone involved in the making of this episode.,literal
"When humor meets tragedy When I heard of this show for the first time I was skeptical about the fact it's supposed to be a comedy and it's also about cancer. How could cancer and comedy be related? Well this is the perfect example for it. The whole series is a roller-coaster of emotions. One minute you laughing out loud and the next minute you feel like crying. You get very attached to the main character Cathy Jamison played beautifully by Laura Linney. This series makes you think about what is essential in life. Is it important to have a lot of money or other material things? No not really, the only thing that matters is your health and being a good person. I really enjoyed this whole show, all actors play their characters very well. The story is well written and keeps you bonded with the characters during the whole series. Certainly worth a watch.",literal
"At least get the storyline right Im hoping it gets better and follows the storyline they had in the original series. First Leroy's dad. They didn't speak after Shannon and Kelly passed away. Which was established in the original series when Gibbs and the team go to Gibbs home town.

And the ""rules"" Gibbs came up with, there is no rule 29, learn to obey before you command, yet in the box there is. The original series set the background for Gibbs to change even a fraction of it ruins the series. I suggest the writers go back to the original series and watch it so they get it right. Because anymore ""surprises"" I'm done. We know how ducky met Gibbs and in this new series they've already met so don't create a new beginning for them. I am unsure where Jenny fits in but it was before Abby.

I could go on but now I'm just going to see where it goes. Oh one last thing this personality young Gibbs has I absolutely hate. Please change it fast because the older Gibbs even when being an ass I liked him. This one I really dislike.",literal
"That was uncomfortable to watch. This series was an emotional rollercoaster to watch. The first few episodes really made me uncomfortable. I didn't know most of the details they showed in the series, so it was shocking to see what Dahmer really did throughout his life. My heart goes out to the innocent victims families, it is really disappointing that people have made this series a joke. There should be no jokes made about what Jeffrey did to these young men. It is dehumanizing and disgusting to do so. I am confused as to why they put Glenda Cleveland's apartment right next to Jeffrey's, when that was not where she lived. I don't know why Netflix decided to include false details about the story. Seeing the police bring Konerak stuck with me watching the rest of the series. How clueless can 2 police officers be? He was an innocent child. What's not included in the series like most, Tracy Edwards who escaped Dahmer's apartment and got him arrested, has been in prison multiple times for many reasons including murder. It is interesting how he almost got murdered by Jeff, and then testified against him but later on murdered someone else. Overall, I believe this series was good. Evan and Niecy's performances were outstanding. I don't know why people are fixated on continuing the entertainment of Dahmer's terrible actions, but it was okay. I hope this is the last film/series/documentary they make about the man and focus more on the victims stories. Let them rest in peace.",figurative
"Amazing! I really liked the way they told the story, showing each person's perspective. I had never seen a movie like that.

I think people didn't like the movie because when they go to the cinema for a horror movie, the only thing they want is to be scared, This film contains many comical scenes, so it might throw people off. But I thought the film was very well balanced and well written. Just not aimed at the right people. The trailers may have given people a different idea of what they were going to see.",literal
"A Great Film Delivered in an Average Way I've never read The Running Man novel, and I thought the 1987 Schwarzenegger film was a fun but forgettable piece of cheesy sci-fi. That's why I was genuinely excited for a new take-especially with Edgar Wright directing. I adore Baby Driver and Hot Fuzz, and I've never disliked anything he's made. While his 2025 version doesn't break that streak, it's easily my least favourite of his films, though still an enjoyable watch overall.

Glen Powell steps in as Ben Richards, a desperate father who agrees to compete on the deadly TV show The Running Man to save his seriously ill child. The month-long hunt for a billion-dollar prize sets up plenty of opportunities for standout supporting roles, and the cameos are a lot of fun. My favourite stretch involves Michael Cera, whose scenes with Powell have great energy and chemistry.

Where the film let me down was in its pacing and surprisingly heavy exposition. For a director known for sharp, kinetic action, Wright delivers a film that feels a bit low-energy and light on set-pieces, especially for a 2-hour-13-minute runtime. The action that is there works, but the storytelling feels too spread out, and the script over-explains things instead of trusting the audience. It also lacks the usual Edgar Wright stylistic punch, which made something feel slightly off.

Even so, Powell gives a committed performance, and the supporting cast-especially Coleman Domingo-brings a lot to the table. The action is fun when it arrives, and despite some characters needing more screen time, everyone makes their moments count. The 2025 Running Man is a great film delivered in an average way, but it's still entertaining and absolutely worth a look, even if it falls short of greatness.",literal
"Who gets a happy ending? This series really kept me on my toes the first few episodes. I struggled to stay intrigued by each character but I wasn't bored by any of them? I loved the mystery of it all.

Spoilers ahead: I get part of the theme is ""white privilege"" but to me it was rich people privilege who were also white.

There were a few characters that definitely lived up to the white privilege concept, especially Shane. Born into money,only worried about what would make him happy, knowing that his mommy would always come save the day. Molly Shannon did a great job at portraying a rich entitled ""Karen"". She made me truly hate her.

And Olivia, beautifully brilliant yet completely ignorant at the same time. She always pretended she was for the underdog when in reality she would never cut up her credit card funded by her parents to live like an actual underdog.

The reason I mention all this is because the message of the series is not transparent. Every wealthy character got what they wanted in the end...as they always do in real life. The ending was weak as in the truly horrible people who don't deserve a happy ending get exactly what they wanted and no hope was granted to those who weren't born into that life style. SThose who have known suffering get crapped on and the wrong person dies leaving the series with a blah ending. No full circle closure for any character.",literal
"Racing horses Wow, this was more like racing horses. First episode was really slow and boring, till things started rolling, and it was more like a non stop. Gary Oldman was simply brilliant, he did a fantastic job leading a secret operation while being damn funny.

Good cast and performance from all actors, given the fact, they are not that famous. Loved each character, great plot, all the twist and turns till the last minute. This was a really good crime suspense thriller and can't wait for season two. Also , loved the fact that it was 6 episodes.

This was the 3rd good tv show done by Apple, and again, can't wait for season 2.",literal
"Sharon stone ruins movie What a let down! Lets be honest, the plot was ""hey wouldn't it be cool to blow up a carnival and have fun deaths"" so the ""plot"" revolved around this idea and honestly I'm here for fun kills and over the top action. This sequel lacked the charm of the first. Sharon stone was God awful. Swearing every other word doesn't make you a badazz it just makes you look weak. They really jumped the shark with her. Pass.",literal
"Another series devolves... Loved the YouTube video, started off liking the series, but slowly and surely the usual corrupt Hollywood morality and philosophy has crept in.

Last episode they make light of stealing someone's stuff, this episode the lead character unwittingly screws the coaches wife, the coach has a heart attack (maybe), and said lead character remains as selfish and clueless as to his being his own worst enemy as he started.

It's a simple concept. Protagonist with everything messes up his life due to his own hubris, seeks redemption, slowly realizes the error of his ways, and triumphs in the end, meanwhile winning the girl.

You don't need all the other garbage. Part of the problem is that they're trying to stretch a 90-minute movie far beyond what the plot allows.

This unfortunately allows the morally bankrupt writers too much time to interject their guttersnipe thoughts and ideas.

Why the hell can't Hollywood just tell a compelling, warm-hearted, uplifting story anymore?

There's enough interest in my part in the story that I'll continue to watch, just to see what happens, but that will only take five minutes per episode as I fast forward past all the tawdry muck.",literal
"Very good After all of the family guy ripoffs, with terrible humor, this is super refreshing. The characters look different from each other (the main ones at least), every episode is good, and most of all, ITS ACTUALLY FUNNY!!!!",literal
"Was it a comedy movie? It didn't feel like a horror movie, everybody in the theater was laughing all the time due the humour in the cast, the kids make jokes all the time about everything, i was a little disappointed because i hoped i would be terrified, but i laughed more than anything. Its not a horror movie at all, its like a parody of a horror movie.",literal
"Too much overacting, too little logic First of all, let's forget that this is an adaptation of a book. This series, apart from the fact that the child was kidnapped and returned alive, has almost no resemblance to the book. The names of the characters are different, their backgrounds and characters are different, their relationships with each other are different. The motive for kidnapping the child is completely different, as well as the epilogue and the fate that the characters experience at the end.

Now about the series. The series follows a wealthy family whose child is kidnapped, the investigation and the final return of the child. During the series, numerous secrets of almost all the characters come to the surface, as well as the ""depth"" of their mutual relationships and motives for them.

Screenplay and direction: Although the plot holds attention to some extent, the screenplay is full of holes in absolutely every episode, which really stick out. The scenario contains a lot of side stories and events that are completely irrelevant to the plot. The story could have been excused in three, maximum four episodes and the series was completely unnecessarily stretched to eight episodes. A lot of dead, too long scenes, especially for the sake of ""evoking emotions"".

Dialogues and acting: Oh my God, what was that? The dialogues between the characters are, to put it mildly, incredibly bad. Illogical, incomprehensible and so artificial that the viewer often wonders if certain lines were written as a real conversation or as a joke. Overacting is present at every step. From the supporting characters, through Peter (Jake Lacy), all the way to the completely unnatural Marissa (Sara Snook). Her body language, facial expressions, ""portrayal of emotions"" are so artificial and bad that it is incomprehensible that an actress of her caliber agreed to such a portrayal of her character.

Two characters worth mentioning, in a positive sense, are Jenny (Dakota Fanning), who looks and behaves normally and logically, and the character of Detective Alcaras (Michael Peña ), who seems to have been written by a completely different screenwriter. Intelligent, normally emotional, logical. Michael Peña really did a great job.

Everything else, from the way the characters talk to each other, hide and reveal the deepest family secrets, express emotions and react to the worst (or best) actions of loved ones, is completely over the top, artificial and unbelievable.

Social background: The atmosphere of the whole series really exudes criticism of society, especially the white community of middle and higher status. Also, the feminist narrative is very present, which portrays all male characters as evil, incompetent or generally negative (except for the aforementioned detective). Especially for this reason, the creation of the character of Marissa, as a successful business woman and, in most of the dialogues with her husband, but also with others, a person with the intelligence of a two-year-old, for whom Detective Alcaraz's son is Einstein himself, is incomprehensible. Her rollercoaster of social and emotional (i)maturity is incredible. But then again, that's down to a brutally bad script and even worse direction.

The series, despite the complete departure from the book, had a good starting story. But the realization was really more than mediocre.",figurative

"A Reminder That Not All Modern TV is Poor The Sopranos is arguably the greatest show in Dramatic Television history.

Its hard to think of another series that boasts so much intelligence, sublime writing or first rate performances.

Across its epic scope it produces fresh and iconic characters and a constant level of high quality. Centering around the life of one Tony Soprano, a man who lives in two families. One is the conventional wife and two kids nuclear family the other a huge New Jersey Mafia group, of which he is the boss of both. Played by James Gandolfini, of True Romance and The Mexican fame, Tony is a fascinating, scary but also likable guy. Full praise must be given to Gandolfini for making a womanising and horrifically aggressive brute a genuinely identifiable and perfect leading man. Contemporay American drama has never had such an arresting and iconic figure as Tony.

The cast of hundreds never boasts a flat performance and such stand out characters like Paulie Walnuts and Ralph Cifaretto will stick in your memory for ever.

The true genius of this tale however, is the creator and writers bravery and revolutionary take on a conventional drama series. Twenty minute long dream sequences, powerful and original use of symbolism and metaphorical imagery and truly shocking scenes of violence. Yet all this style is met by truly touching themes of love, honour and respect for family. The series never becomes cold hearted or gratuitous.

With TV now competitive and often poor The Sopranos stands tall above the rest as America's most original and compelling drama. Forget Family Redifined. This is Television Redifined.",literal
"Brings New Meaning to ""Made to Order"" I haven't seen this movie for a long time, so for all I know it's horrible, but I have nothing but good memories of it.

Any red-blooded American male has to at least appreciate the premise: two horny teens discover a way to create the perfect woman, who exists for no other purpose than to fulfill their every fantasy. Hot damn!! Their perfect woman is Kelly Le Brock, who wouldn't necessarily be my choice, but she'll do.

John Hughes was on a roll with his teen comedy genre, and this film preserves the memorable performances of Anthony Michael Hall and a young Bill Paxton as the world's most obnoxious older brother.

Grade: B",literal
"Extremely Dark Story/Well-Done Mini Series This is a mini series chronicling the horrible crimes of Jeffrey Dahmer. Evan Peters is very good playing the title role. No campy stuff here, just plays Dahmer completely convincingly and serious.

Makes effective use of flashbacks to Dahmer's childhood and teen years to explain how he turned out the way he did.

Richard Jenkins plays Dahmer's father. He's great as a man broken by years of unhappiness culminating in realization of what his son has become. Penelope Ann Miller is wonderful in her short role as Dahmer's unstable, UFO-chasing mother.

Niecy Nash has a small role as Dahmer's next-door neighbor. Her scenes are some of the most terrifying and unsettling, not for what you see, but for the sounds she endured. Love her in this role.

The acting is pretty good across the board. The actors playing his victims were perfect at conveying terror. Shaun J. Brown plays Tracy Edwards, a victim, in the first episode. The scene had me on the edge of my seat. Without going into detail, the scene takes place mainly in Dahmer's apartment.

Everything has a very dirty look to it, low lit, hazy. You could almost imagine the ""smell"" of the scenes. As horrible as that sounds, it does make for effectively creepy watching.

Again, the subject matter is very dark and hard to endure. The series takes viewers from Dahmer's childhood up through his trial and imprisonment. I felt like Evan Peters completely inhabited his role. Also left me low with immense sadness for the families of the real-life victims, the survivors of his crimes, and the neighbors and others whose lives are left scarred by the actions of Dahmer the Monster.",literal
They love takin that thing This show is going to take us deeeeeep into the rabbit hole and it's gonna get weird. Tim and Zach are comedic geniuses.

"2025 has delivered its cult classic We'll talk about the film, but let me start with the trailer first. Only when the makers have absolute confidence in their film can they craft such a stunning trailer. It shows a lot, yet reveals nothing. I'd still prefer that one doesn't watch the trailers, especially the 2nd one before watching the film. You'll enjoy the film even more if you don't.

Now, coming to the film. What a beauty! The performances and screenplay are absolutely on point. Michael B. Jordan delivers a career-high performance in his double role as twin brothers Smoke and Stack. Miles Caton as Sammie, the blues guitarist, steals every scene he's in with a soulful, electric presence. Everyone else is great in their roles too.

The film pulls you into its universe, and you become completely immersed. It builds up gradually, with the first hour unfolding as a deliberate, blues-infused drama that just carefully sets up its characters and the theme. Once it hits its stride and the horror kicks in, there is no looking back.

Around the halfway mark, you begin to understand what's really happening. And once the plot unfolds, you are taken on a blend of intrigue, thrill, anxiety, and (some) humour. You just can't take your eyes off the screen. It's epic!

The music too does not just accompany the story, it elevates it and becomes a part of its soul. There's one jaw-dropping sequence, and it is pure movie magic, bridging past and future through music in probably one of the best cinematic moments ever witnessed in a film.

For me, Sinners for sure is the best film of 2025 so far. I just loved everything about it. It starts slow but steadily begins to surprise and amaze. Every next 10 minutes feels better than the last, and it just keeps going higher from there.

It has all the flavours of a cult classic, one that would be talked about for years to come.",literal
"Stay away Very bad movie, with no point or purpose. Not scary in any way and a complete waste of time. Nothing was explained in any way and had no direction. Very boring and long, not fun or scary at any moments.

The storyline and dialogue is very poor, acting is not engaging. The girl in the woodsy cabin vibe was the only good thing, and it didn't hurt my eyes with any bright flashing. Jump scares weren't effect or startling, couple flashings of women screaming with blood on their face.",literal
WHAT THE F... Can we just acknowledge that that Season 4 finale had some of the best writing of any TV show ever!?

"Overhyped and cringe I watched this movie because it was hyped online, but it didn't live up to expectations. It feels mostly made for K-pop fans and kids. The songs are annoying, especially if you don't usually listen to K-pop, and the exaggerated facial expressions are cringy. The frame rate also seemed off in some scenes.

The story is random and full of plot holes. All the characters feel the same-they try to be funny but fail, and while the writer attempts to give them depth, it doesn't work. The demons are just evil with no explanation about their motives or origins, and the ending is rushed. The message that ""girls can do anything"" feels forced and unnecessary.

Overall, it's an overhyped, cringe-worthy K-pop movie.",literal
"The UK version is vastly superior I love the UK version. Very very funny. This version though... oh dear!

It's not that the ghosts are different in the American version, it's just that they're not funny. The hippy is so annoying, as is the army guy, and the rest of them don't really bring anything to the table. They're all so forgettable that I can't even remember most of their names. Says it all really.

I have watched nearly two whole series of this, and the laughs are like looking for a needle in a haystack. You might get a chuckle once per episode (if that). But that's all it will be, a mild chuckle. It's certainly not 'spit your tea out' funny.

Some shows just don't translate well on the other side of the Atlantic, and this is certainly one of them.",literal
"hilarious I love this show and think it's one of the best new shows on television. It expands upon the ""boy meets girl"" theme. The show features a bunch of ultra-geeky physicists who share an apartment. They are brilliant in the laboratory but totally inept outside of it. In moves gorgeous girl Penny across the hall, and she starts showing them what ""real life"" is all about. I think everything about this show is first-rate, from the writing and performances to the final cut. I hope this one stays around for a while. It certainly has potential. It is worth it just to watch Kaley Cuoco in it. She acts as good as she looks in it.

"great true story Very rarely, a true story can be more fascinating than fiction. In the late 90's, a man named Jeffery Manchester (Channing Tatum), a divorced father of three, robbed over forty restaurants by breaking in through the roofs (rooves?), earning himself the name ROOFMAN. This movie focuses on his life after he escapes prison, how he lived in a Toys R Us for 6 months, and how he meets Leigh (Kirsten Dunst), a divorced mother of two. Director Derek Cianfrance has found a fascinating true story to work with, and he does a great job with it. Tailored to Tatum's likability and charm, this seems like a comedy, but it's more like a dramedy. Jeff is a very polite person, according to the workers he stuck in freezers. The chemistry between the two leads is really great. This is my favorite performance from both Tatum and Dunst. Jeff is very observational, and the movie actually shows that in action. The side characters are fun, including Uzo Aduba, Ben Mendelsohn, Juno Temple, LaKieth Stanfield, and Peter Dinklage. We do see some Tatum butt, if that gets you to the theatre. The script isn't really interested in diving any deeper into the ""why"" of it all, more on the ""what"". It probably could be a little shorter. It has a perfect balance between tones throughout. It's refreshing to see a pretty realistic romance. Overall, it's a very entertaining story with a few emotional moments and quite a few funny ones. ROOFMAN might not blow the roof off, but it's still very good.",literal
"Every bit of this movie is frustrating The other ""Metahumans"" are ridiculous and pea brained. The dog is the only good character in the movie and Superman sits around moping about oh poor me no one likes me when he should be out looking for his dog. The relationship between Lois and Clark is just dry. Lex is not believable bc they hired one of the worst actors for the part. It's just a whiny boring stupid version of Superman. This is so far off the mark, I think Gunn should find a new hobby and leave the DC comics alone.",literal
"Bring. Percy. Back. Dont get me wrong I absolutely love the show. Season 1 was phenomenal. Season 2 is amazing so far. But its missing one key detail, Xavier.

His character although in season 1 had lower screentime compared to others made a huge impact on the way this show felt. His and Wednesdays banter was a favorite amongst many fans including myself. They knew each other since childhood, they have a psychic connection, they were set up to have an amazing plot line, and it was obvious it was set up as a slow burn.

Without him being there the show feels like theres a huge gaping hole and it can only be fixed if he comes back. They tried to fill the whole with the weird love triangle Enid is now in and it just doesn't work. And not to mention this ""romance"" between Tyler and Wednesday, that just needs to end, Wednesdays character isnt gonna be with someone like Tyler, its been shown in previous Addams Family works who fits Wednesday the most. Someone who sees her for who she truly is, who understands her, whose not gonna hold her back and hurt innocent people who havent done anything. Wednesday might love to harm people, but she does it to people who deserve it.

All because of accusations put against him Percy Hynes Whites career has been ruined when he is such an incredible actor.

His character was so important even in season 2 they knew they would have to mention and bring a reason to his absence. They couldve left it at the one scene where Wednesday says ""Xaviers not coming back this year?"" but they KNEW that wouldnt be enough. Later in the episode Xavier sent a painting of a vision he had that he knew had something to do with Wednesday and a goodbye letter. THEY ARE STILL CONNECTED EVEN THOUGH HES NOT THERE! The writers are aware of the impact of Xavier or else they wouldnt have done that.

Theres so many other points to be made but with that being said, in season 3 bring Percy/Xavier back. We as the fans deserve that much, if your not gonna do it for Percy, do it for us.",figurative
"No blood, no tension n zero horror. Total disappointment. I saw this with my family in Movietime Suburbia, Bandra.

"Roofman flopped Roofman starts out quickly compared to the overall movie. Found it be cheesy& boring , birthday party, large house, gullibility of adults portrayed, seeing Tatum's butt or dance in underwear are lowlights. Living how Tatum lived in the film for so long without people knowing who he was but the local police knew didn't add up. Plus, how Tatum gets emotional in the end isn't believable and or poor acting along with how he is captured is like who didn't see that coming? Then, to show the actual people comparing to who portrayed them along with historical bio updates is a movie trying to be serious. Why, probably because it's supposed to be based on true events. Different actors, writers and director equals a better movie IMO.",literal

"Another Taylor Sheridan hit If you were a fan of Mayor of Kingstown, you will like this show as well. Even the opening credits are similar in style and cinematography, guess that's a Taylor Sheridan trademark. Billy Bob Thornton delivers his grizzled, snarky, no nonsense lines with typical Billy Bob Thornton sarcasm. There's one scene in one of the first few episodes where Thornton's character gives a long speech about the necessity of petroleum in every area of our lives, which definitely sounds like propaganda written into the script the oil industry, but none of what he says is untrue. Kind of funny that the first few episodes are sponsored by the American petroleum Institute and feature ads showing oil and petroleum workers. Overall I think this is going to be a great show, the writing is great, the acting is great, and the characters are very human.",figurative
"Which version is better? Both versions of this film are available...in fact, in a combo pack...from Criterion. Both are in great condition, although the 1935 version is in black and white. Both have great casts. And, now in the summer of our discontent, I've just finished watching both versions.

This version fixes a couple of glaring blunders from the first film. There's a scene in the 1935 version where a man falls into a ditch. It was a STUPID scene that, from my perspective, wouldn't even work in a comedy film...and this is no comedy film. In this 1954 version, that segment was totally rewritten and makes sense. The other problem in the 1935 version is when a totally blind woman chooses to disappear. Just how would that be done, particularly in a foreign country. Here, that segment is fixed, as well, when a companion accompanies her.

Oddly enough, this later version seems to have more of a religious perspective to it, which I was not pleased to see. It isn't overwhelming, but it's there. It was more subtle in the 1935 version.

Irene Dunne, who starred in the 1935 version was excellent. I do think that Jane Wyman outdid her by a bit. More of a draw between Robert Taylor (1935) and Rock Hudson (1954).

This version has two character actors that are almost always good. Otto Kruger and Agnes Morehead.

I'll be honest. Each version had its strengths and weaknesses. I might give a slight preference to this version, but I enjoyed both.",literal
"my favourite tv show The office is the best show ever shot without the laugh effect. And that makes it more noticeable. Because I don't like laughing effects. I think the laugh effects are unnecessary because I have to decide for myself where to laugh.

Anyway, this series reflects the office spirit very well and the characters and actors are incredibly good. I identified with all of them. Although I love each character individually, my favorite character (even though I didn't like it at first) is andy. I can laugh at him even if he does something stupid. There are very few TV shows that I watch with a laugh, and the office has certainly succeeded in being one of them. Definitely you should watch it soon...",literal
"Not a very good Predator movie. The Disney Pg-13 Star Wars Predator Movie has finally arrived. Unfortunately I'm a huge Predator fan and have been all my life. Not only myself but my whole family including my Dad and Uncle are Predator fans who have seen the original one in theaters. In a nutshell most of the things we liked about the Predator movies is completely thrown out the window in this Movie. The movie is exactly what you would expect out of a Disney Predator movie and is very disappointing. They have officially humanized and delegitimized the Predator and made him completely un-intimidating. Some things are better off not being done. They made the Predator talk the entire movie and made him have a relationship with a female robot like the ones in the alien franchise. They even gave him his own Grogu style child creature to take under his wing and look after. They essentially made the Predator a Star Wars mandalorian episode. They even gave the Predators lightsaber like weapons to fight with. They hyped up that other Predator, the main Predator's dad, to be real tough and powerful but he got killed in like 1 minute at the end of the film by his son. I really tried to find things to like about this film but kept being disappointed and let down. The Predator has become completely humanized and unserious no different than a Star Wars alien. I have a feeling that most of the people who will like this movie are the same type of people who like the new Star Wars sequel movies and the acolyte show. They are the same people who like the new marvel shows and movies. People who just tolerate and accept everything that is given to them without any sense of standards or taste for good movies and people who attack and demonize anyone who doesn't like the new movies and shows that come out. If you like this Predator film good for you. To each their own but it's not for me.",literal
"One to watch - aged well ! I saw this when it aired the first time around. Loved it ! Rewatched it now and it's still as good as I remember. Not all shows age well. That's mostly because the viewers are used to a different phase and format nowadays.

This show is more about the people and their relationships. It dosent circle around the medical stuff. Even if the medical parts are very accurate!",literal
"Typical medical drama I'm looking at these reviews and am trying to figure out what is so bad. I didn't watch House, so I don't get the references to that show. But the amount of bad reviews really don't seem warranted. The show is not that bad.

I really like Sherlock Holmes stuff, so I was looking forward to how they would tie in to it. So far, it's still elusive but I like how they are trying flesh out the characters outside of Sherlock.

The show isn't anything new, but it's a pleasant watch with an easy-to-follow storyline that I enjoy watching to see how they diagnose cases. I'm hopeful the network will allow us to get to know the character backstories. I'm interested in finding out more about the medical students, the connection between Shinwell and M, if Watson will get better and restore his memory, catch M and handle his relationship with the hospital director. The show isn't breaking any boundaries but it's also just an enjoyable formulaic medical drama.",literal
"Griping story from all angles Gritty...so very gritty

But this is the good aspect if this show. I almost passed in this shiw because it looked like so many other east coast shows that film in blue filters and showcase the towns like it's still the 1920's. But this is really good.

Every character is a shade of gray. And does not give off any superfluous Aires if any side being totally black or white.

Yet there are huge impactful moments that shock both good and bad. It never tries to preach real world politics...it just shows the story as it is.

I live no life portrayed by any character on the show but find myself invested in so many of them. And their outcomes. The show is not shy about being in afraid at NOT pulling punches. Seems no character is truly safe to make it to the next season or even episode.

While I hated the producers show ""Yelliwstone"" (but loved its offshoot shows), I'm finding this producer has been making some phenomenal shows. Another one besides this one is Lioness. Absolute gold in a time when tv shows are sparse and what is available is horrifyingly bad.",literal
"Unpleasant Having seen episode on, it's an intriguing story but I find the bad language and course dialogue very unpleasant. I suspect writers and producers imagine that is how people speak in the real world but it isn't. I don't knowpeople who speak like that. A good actor can show how unpleasant a character is without the writer having to give them unpleasant dialogue.",literal
"Ellen Barkin I am only on the first season, so my review may be a little pre-mature. From what I'm reading it goes downhill after the third season, so we will see. From what I've seen so far, it's a pretty entertaining series. It revolves around the Cody's, a family of criminals. Most of their crimes are big pay-off operations and heists. It's very loosely based on an Australian movie of the same name. The movie also revolved around a family of criminals with the mother as the leader of the gang. The series is pretty much the same plot, but it takes place on the beaches of southern California. There is some beautiful scenery. Most of the actors are attractive with nice bodies and you see a lot of them. The matriarch of the series is played by Ellen Barkin, and she is probably the best part of the series. This roll was made for her. She steels every scene. I think of Jessica Lang in AHS when I see Barkin's performance in this. Other than Barkin, The Codys are comprised of her 4 sons and grandson Jay. It's an interesting that this old woman runs rules over 5 men. She is much more street smart and clever than her sons. In between the heists there is family drama and tons of sex, drug use and surfing. It's like Godfather meets Point Break. I feel like they leaned into the last three things a little too much. I would've like to have seen more clever heists. None of the characters are really empathetic even at their most vulnerable, but Smurf, Pope and Jay are more developed and complex. Most of the other character are 2 dimensional and unlikeable. I feel that it's not a very realistic show because there's just no way this family would be getting away with these big heists for so long, but if you are willing to suspend disbelief, you might check out the pilot to see if it's for you.",literal
Amazing The film from my point of view shows that the difference becomes something normal after dealing,literal
"I don't get the hype I tried to understand why so many people were raving about this movie. I will admit that the cinematic experience was great. Some really beautiful scenes that took me by surprise. The costume were fitting for the era. Everything about in every scene was beautiful. But where it lost it's greatness to me was not the acting, but in it's trying to convince me that these vampires was menacing. The eyes were just too comical for me and the gore was too over the top. One area where it hit hard was the music. Even if you are not a fan of the genre you will enjoy the music.

That is something very special that we don't see often in the movies, using music in this was to tell a story.",literal
"Series 3 was near perfect! Loved the characters in the first Series but the story was ruined by incredibly annoying bad guys and an incompetent hostage. Series 2 was a step up, which was genuinely terrifying thanks to the unstoppable Russian, but it's series 3 that brings everything to a satisfying conclusion with four semi-regular a-holes removed from the chessboard. I was at the edge of my seat wondering if any of the slow horses would survive this time around. River gets his head handed to him from start to finish and is the antithesis of the typical hero. I adore the current roster (never liked Min), particularly the scrappy cocaine user. Series 3 is the best season of any show I've watched in awhile and I was terrified of what would happen in the last two episodes. Unlike any movie I've watched in the last 5 years, there was a real palpable tension and danger at the end, considering the track record of the team. I hope series 4 is better or as good!",figurative
"Heavy on the weird, light on the science. Continuing my revisit of 80s films (mostly '85 so far), with Weird Science... which I've not seen before. Gary (Anthony Micheal Hall) and Wyatt (Ilan Mitchell-Smith) are geeks, before geeks were cool. They're in high school... I think everyone was in the 80s and they're desperate to talk to girls, mostly just desperate. After watching Frankenstein, they decide they're going to make their own... not a monster... a girl. With the use of a crap PC. Inputing their requirements by feeding magazines into a scanner whilst red mist and lightening forms above the house, they create Lisa (Kelly LeBrock). Who turns up in her knickers and a cropped jumper. ""So, what would you little maniacs like to do first?"". Shower apparently, because this is really just a comic vehicle for teenage fantasies. Nothing makes sense. Nothing needs to. Lisa can conjure anything she wants and sets about helping Gary and Wyatt learn to socialise... which they are very bad at. It's all very awkward. Fair play to Hall especially, he really goes for it. It's ridiculous, but everything is. Including Wyatt's big brother Chet's (Bill Paxton) haircut. Okay, everyone's haircut. I'm looking at you Robert Downey Jr. To boost their popularity Lisa throws a party. Again a staple of any 80s film. In Wyatt's house, with people dancing badly to bad music and of course trashing the house. Along with help of some Mad Max style bikers, a ballistic missile and a blonde girl getting striped nearly naked. Typical Hughes. It's weird, but hey it's in the title. Hughes was making this alongside The Breakfast Club. Do this and we'll fund the next one kind of deal. So this has that in its favour... and Hall probably did quite well too. There's not much else to say. Gary and Wyatt don't exactly learn anything, but everything works out well. Aside for Chet who justifiably gets turned into a slimy blob. It's heavy on the weird, light on the science, but it's not that bad and I'm sure I'd have loved it if I'd seen it as a kid.",literal
"Almost as good as its predecessor in a different way The film does a great job homaging classic horror films from the 80s while also remaining true to its own lineage. This time the Grabber switches targets to Finney's sister Gwen who has a stronger connection to the supernatural and while at times it may feel like Finney is relegated to a secondary character, the exploration of his trauma and his realistic attempts to block it out is well performed.

I like that we get to explore more of the Grabber's backstory and his actions as a fledgling killer, although I wonder if connecting his history to that of Gwen and Finney's mother is entirely necessary. However it does allow for an emotional performance from Gwen who's dealing with the paranoia of her abilities, how she inherited it from her mother and learning how to use them.

While it doesn't feel as spine tingling as the first movie, this sequel is a fun watch for horror fans and a worthy follow up.",literal
Besides Duchovny the acting is awful Just a really bad watch. Weak script and even weaker acting. Jack Whitehall is not a serious or dramatic actor and the casting is a mystery to me. It reads like a school production and is generally poorly executed. I was fairly keen to watch this but half way through episode one I knew I was in for something less than mid.,literal
"Clumsy & Boring Delivery of what could have been an interesting message. I actually got a headache watching this. I don't often write reviews but I was physically sick after from the stress of waiting for a good movie to show up in the theater.

The dialogue was so long and drawn out that I was exhausted waiting for the point. When the point finally arrived, I was annoyed at how long it took to get there and I didn't care anymore at what they were trying to say.

The score was horrible. There was no music in scenes that needed it, and when there was music, it was like you were watching Space Odyssey and they were trying to attribute meaning to scenes that were not nearly as deep as they tried to make them.

Everything fell flat in an incredibly frustrating way. It was like thinking you got a front row seat to your favorite musician only to discover it's an impersonator. The actors are capable of incredible things, but after every line they paused for a few seconds longer than natural just to make every word fall flat. The emotions were off and I felt a constant ache for what the scenes could have been.

The shots were odd and there was a scene of people dancing and Pedro Pascal at a table talking, but no dialogue. It was off center and supposed to be artistic, but it just felt awkward and the sound was all over the place, focusing on people partying and him having a conversation you couldn't hear. Then there was a serious conversation Dakota Johnson had with her boss and in the background girls were getting excited over something that fell flat when revealed, and it carried on way longer than it should have and only served to distract from whatever meaningless conversation was trying to be had that was too long anyways.

I'm so tired of movies like this. The trailers seem wonderful and capture your interest to see a fantastic movie and then you get there and it's the worst ~2 hours spent because you feel cheated. This could have been an amazing movie. It had all the right ingredients, but the wrong execution. The point of not being materialist was a good one - but fell insanely flat. Waste of time.",figurative
"It's amazing what being rich can buy Definitely feels like Kim paid her way into this role.

I have to admit, I've seen the hype about it so I was curious to give it a go. And I was honestly shocked at how bad it is. Good actresses acting poorly and I'm sorry but as much as Kim can buy her way into anything, this was a complete fail. To be honest, even the outfits aren't good!

The only one who acts well is Naomi watts. The others are cringeworthy to watch.",literal

"A cop and a librarian start a romance in a small town. Murder may be involved. Murder in a Small Town piqued my interest due to Kristin Kreuk, and lo and behold, she is paired with another Sutherland lad. I love small-town settings, and a murder mystery makes for a great combination. The first episode started out nicely: there's a murder, and the next-door elderly neighbor seems to be the culprit, but how and why? I liked that they elaborated on the characters and gave them a good backstory. I also liked that the show doesn't feel like the usual flashy, slick murder-mystery theme. But what intrigued me the most is the chemistry of the two leads: two 40-somethings with past experiences and baggage, trying love for the second time. Kreuk's Cassandra is feisty and bubbly, while Sutherland's Karl is this two-shirt type of detective. Together, they turn this small-town mystery into a slow-burn romance that's worth every twist.",literal
"Good for its genre I think of it as 8/10 for the Hallmarky made for TV Romantic Comedy type. It's funny and easy going, really enjoyable

4/10 if you're someone who is looking for quality stuff and somehow for some reason decided to go for this movie... yeah no",literal

Ex marine flagged draped over shoulder the guv'ment needs to do something i served & paid my dues blah blah and look what has happened to me (victim) evil bank taking property (the corporations are evil) this will play well for Americans that want to blame others for their failures.

They stopped just short of introducing a character named Q to narrate everything that is RELLY going on. That would have been much more transparent to their intentions.

This looked and felt like a Clint Eastwood political diatribe so I wasn't surprised to find he was the first choice.",literal
"Fed up with people saying it's slow This is not an action. This is not a thriller. This is not Terminator 2. I am disgusted at people downvoting it because ""nothings happening""

Again, not a thriller, not an action.

You get me?",figurative
Like but cheesy Show is okay but why is Morgan dressed like a streetwalker although men probably like the look. This does add some distinction from other crime shows. Morgan's character is smart and she grows on you. Her daughter dresses better than she does. Morgan could be dressed a little more classy. Story lines are good and other characters are good. Love the smart son and the interaction she has with her children. Not sure on the ratings and time will tell if it will be renewed. Maybe it will be given another season. It's not as good as some other shows that were cancelled and should have been given more time.,literal
Epic One Punch Man has the perfect balance between powerful planet bursting action scenes and a chilled main character that doesn't seem to bother about anything going on. The animation of the first season is top notch the way the images display the impact and speed of the fights is just mind blowing and a must watch for every animation lover. Also there's this great humor and perfect timing that makes One Punch Man almost a parody for so many other Anime shows. When Son Goku's gotta train his butt off to defeat his enemies Saitama is already over this point. He just needs one punch to blow away whatever's standing in his way. This idea is just brilliant to me and works surprisingly well. Watch this show you won't regret it.,figurative
Best movie of 2024!!! This movie is by far one of the best movies of all time. The director is a genius and the actors did an amazong job!!! Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo are not only able to showcase big emotions but also are in a superior league when it comes to vocal performance. Arianas powerful vocals combined with extrodinary vocal control are able to get you to tears as well as the power and pureness of Cynthia Erivos voice. Both of them as well as the other actors are able to push you to tears but also get you to joy. Especially Grande has a great sense of humor and is going to make you laugh throughout the movie!,literal
"CGI clotted tripe I am on the 3rd episode and my problem is the same problem I had with the 2 movies, which was it relies far too much on CGI and horror tropes to make it even remotely compelling. Also, as with period pieces, they overdo the whole ""Oh, look at us! We are in the early 60s!"" with the wardrobe and mannerisms that are far overexaggerated than reality. I grew up in the 60s and it's comical on how everyone is dressed and the how they acted. Truth be told, hardly anyone dressed that way, and they sure didn't act that way. Yes, I know, this is fiction. Yes, I know, reality is truly boring.

I can overlook that if there were more practical effects regarding the horror. CGI horror is too cartoonish and instead of being scary, it's actually quite the opposite.

The one good thing I can take away from this is that it is a series and that does aid in the storytelling, so that's promising. Loose some of the CGI and I think it will be much more watchable.",literal
"The Difficulties in Finding Love A matchmaker, Lucy, helps individuals navigate the tricky, complicated, and ever-changing world of dating in hopes of assisting them in finding the perfect match and everlasting love. Lucy has successfully found matches for others but still can not figure out her love life. That is until she meets a wealthy man who checks all her boxes.

This is a dramatic take on the current state of dating. It explores what many people say are the struggles of dating and individuals' expectations of their potential partners. The movie also explores love, long-term relationships, and how one's past affects their present. Some of the situations are relatable, while others are not. The one-hour and fifty-six-minute runtime has many slow moments, allowing the audience's attention to drift. This could be a good movie for a date night, but it might require being in a particular mental space to truly enjoy it.",literal
"Amazing show! I thought a good review was needed to counter all the apparent Nazi sympathizers that are trashing the show. The pilot is a little rough but all pilots are.

"Look closely because the closer you look the more you'll ignore this film's foolishness What You Should Know – Look closely because the closer you look the more you'll ignore this film's foolishness. Like most summer blockbusters it doesn't make perfect sense, but that doesn't stop it from being a fun film to watch especially with that incredible, though unbelievable, ending.

What Works – The misdirection is impressive. The story isn't about the four magicians or the heists they ""magically"" perform. While that would have made more sense this movie moves in cheap tricks and clever nonsense.

What Doesn't Work – All the unanswered questions. There is a scene where a romance is sparked, but it never ignites and another scene where they argue about where they will go once they perform their final trick, but they don't actually go anywhere. There are a lot of missing parts that leave this puzzle filled with too many holes to see the big picture.

What I Thought – Wait for DVD Now You See Me is what any magic act should be – fascinating to figure out and tricky when revealed. Mark Rafflo stomps around most of the movie so upset at any moment you'd expect him to turn into The Hulk and Jesse Eisenberg plays the same smart and smug ""genius"" he did in The Social Network. That's not a great mash-up – at least not great enough to see in theaters. Instead of having audiences leave in awe and applause, there is a residue of deceit and dissatisfaction.",literal
"A bit flat I was really looking forward to this as I love a good pint of Guinness and I know the beer is really nothing to do with this story but it is quite boring. The cinematography and atmosphere are like Peaky Blinders but storyline lets it down.

A shame and could have been much better, I would say James Norton was excellent though.",literal
"A wonderfully acted cynical fable London Film Festival review

For a moment BUGONIA is like watching ""Misery"" or ""Funny Games"" through the lens of 1950s Hollywood dystopian paranoia films. Yorgos follows the sadistic path he started in The Killing of a Sacred Deer and Kinds Of Kindness playing with Kubrick-like visuals and sounds to deliver a fairly straightforward cynical fable until it's not.

Emma and Jesse explore a violent theatricality and beautiful expressionism to great success. Both are harrowing and spectacular (this is Plemons best part ever) but are also limited by the linearity of it all. The last act reconnects Lanthimos with his subversive, unpredictable and absurd poetry but I guess Media, Politics and Truths are this year's true topics. Not surprising this film shares common grounds with Eddington.

I wanted to love it but I just really really liked it.",literal
"show is promising! The premise of the show is entertaining, and the main character is not just another lone wolf guy with a chip on his shoulder - there's real warmth there. There were pretty quick intros to all the other characters but there was a lot of ground to cover to establish the show's premise so I get it - I look forward to learning how they all started working together and watching those relationships develop. It is a familiar formula in the sense that there are new cases each week with an overall background mystery to dig into, but hey - that's a formula that works for a lot of shows and this one does it well. Look forward to seeing more!",literal
"Entertaining but utterly fictional Whilst the pace and writing are good , the entire premise is utterly unrealistic . Diplomats do NOT get involved at anywhere near this level , they have security clearance for knowing but no involvement in decision making other than to relay info to those in power . The casting is pretty good , I like particularly the security detail , they're sharp and collaborative and get some very good lines .

All in all it's a faulty polished production , it's not VEEP or Homeland , it doesn't grip you go but it's a good way to pass the time .

It's fluff .. good fluff but fluff nevertheless and shouldn't be used as a yardstick !",figurative
"Not a spiritual movie but an entertaining one It was a good date night movie. It's been a minute since my wife and I have been able to see a decent film that wasn't all action-packed. I didn't know much about it going in, but I've always been a fan of Miles Teller movies.

This one actually reminded me a bit of Albert Brooks' Defending Your Life - which is another great movie, by the way. It had a nice mix of serious undertones and comedy at the same time.

It's definitely not what I personally believe the afterlife to be, but it was an interesting take. The acting was really solid, and even though it's a comedy, I found it surprisingly thought-provoking. It dives into what love and marriage really mean in a way that sticks with you.

Do you need to see it in theaters? Not necessarily. But will you laugh? Absolutely. You might even tear up a little. I found it entertaining, and I'd definitely watch it again.",literal
Enjoyable story Supported by great actors. I like the show. Episodes flow well and not drawn out. Like how they are introducing famous characters little by little.

In other words the show is terrible, all the legitimate commenters, raters, reviewers give it about a ""3 star"" and the promoters are so desperate they are massively shilling.

"Can anyone honestly say they didn't like this movie? I don't know if there is anything which could be considered a spoiler in here, but I wanted to be safe....The only reason I'm writing this review is because I recently became aware through the marvels of IMDb that there are actually people who hate this movie! How is that possible? >lol< This is perhaps the best film I have ever seen, and for some inexplicable reason I feel duty-bound to defend it. So here goes. For one thing, the inability of narrow-minded movie-goers to pigeon-hole this film (a lot of hyphens there...might be a personal record) is evidence of its brilliance. Action, historical, mystery, martial arts(wait, I'll get to that--be patient), horror, Gothic romance, ""period"" piece, espionage (well, sort of), all done to perfection in my humble opinion. OK, now for the martial arts: Fronsac and Mani are world travelers. It is made clear that they have had numerous adventures in several countries. Is it that far-fetched to think that perhaps two open-minded, fairly intelligent adventurers studied chop-socky somewhere in the Orient? As suspension of disbelief goes, I find that fairly nominal. Besides, the fight scenes freakin' rocked, which covers a multitude of sins. As to the characters being arrogant? Most of them are aristocrats or church hierarchy, so...yeah, they're arrogant. And Fronsac is such a bad mofo, how can he help but think he's better than everybody? And since when is it strange for old men in the 1700s to woo young girls? Creepy, yes, but far from abnormal for the era. I'll admit that it is a long movie and probably could have been streamlined a little, but I have to say, any film that is shot so beautifully...well, I can forgive some superfluousness (look it up, it is so a word) just for a chance to see more of the cinematographer's purty pictures. Someone actually said this movie was gory and shocking...Oh you naive child! Go watch a film like ""Hostel"" or ""High Tension"", then tell me this movie is shocking or bloody! Anyway, to make a long story short (TOO LATE) this film simply CANNOT be dismissed with a flippant ""it sucked"". Well, technically it can be, but it's WRONG.",literal
"A forgettable thriller that never finds its spark Now You See Me Now You Don't tries to be clever, but it ends up feeling cheesy and predictable. The twists are easy to spot long before they happen and the story never builds any real tension. Compared to other films I have seen recently, this one feels slow and surprisingly dull. The cast does what they can, but the script leaves them with very little to work with. Overall it is an average watch at best and not something I would rush to recommend.",literal
"Would be nice if a Tulsa based show didnt show just the rat het side of tulsa but its a good watch Set amid the crumbling edges and quietly bubbling tensions of contemporary Tulsa, ""The Lowdown"" follows Lee Raybon (Hawke)-a battered, wisecracking bookstore owner and freelance ""truthstorian,"" whose line between digging into civic mysteries and breaking them wide open gets blurrier by the episode. Inspired by real-life journalist Lee Roy Chapman, Raybon is the kind of noir figure that's become a rarity: more disheveled than tough, a crusading outsider but never fully at ease in his own skin. Hawke leans into the part with wild-eyed, hangdog charisma. Every scene brims with the lived-in energy only a performer of his caliber can bring-sometimes exhausted, sometimes manic, always utterly compelling.

Harjo's scripting takes full advantage of Tulsa's unique history and character: near-forgotten racial violence, modern gentrification, and a thriving underworld of local power brokers cast long shadows over ""The Lowdown's"" world. The show packs in vintage genre references-think Chandler, Hammett, and the sun-blasted dream logic of ""Inherent Vice""-yet never feels derivative. There are scenes of laugh-out-loud absurdity (a caviar farming misadventure is an early highlight) but also hard-hitting social commentary: the show's villains range from skinhead goons to country-club developers with big plans for North Tulsa.

The heart of this eight-episode season, though, is messy family-especially how Lee's crusade imperils, then redefines, his relationship with his ex-wife (Kaniehtiio Horn) and daughter Francis (Ryan Kiera Armstrong). Armstrong is a standout, trading wry banter and emotional gut punches with Hawke. The supporting cast-Keith David as Marty, Kyle MacLachlan as Donald, Tim Blake Nelson, Jeanne Tripplehorn, and indie stalwarts like Macon Blair-round out a world that always feels one secret away from boiling over.

Visually, ""The Lowdown"" crackles with a moody, golden-hour grit, from battered bookstores to smoky cedar bars-Harjo and his team's affection for Tulsa seeps into every frame. There's a real sense of place, from historic Greenwood Avenue to the outlying Oklahoma suburbs, that deepens the narrative stakes. The script deftly balances bleak truths with moments that feel triumphantly, cathartically human.

If there's a flaw, it's that a few plot threads ramble without tidy resolution; but that's also part of the charm. Like Raybon himself, the show is less about hard answers than bearing witnessdevotees or Hawke ever-risky path as an actor, ""The Lowdown"" is not to be missed.",figurative
"Ultimately, this remains one of the greatest television series of all time, even with it's complete failure of a conclusion. Game of Thrones is a series we caught onto just after Season 2 and watched real-time straight through after catching up off HBO until the very final episode. The storyline focuses on several kingdoms, many of which feel they have their own claim to the throne that rules them all. When a powerful and incestuous family takes the throne away from a recently killed king, some noble families emerge only to be ruthless struck down and family scattered. Watch as the family members strive for success on their own and hope to get their lands back on the right foot and direction.

The cinematography , special effects, costumes, writing, acting, character development and methodical execution of this series is all time great. The series seems to cut no corners of fulfillment, intensity, and unpredictability up until the final two seasons. As the vastness of this series begins heading towards its ultimate conclusion, characters started feeling...out of character, taking steps and directions that didn't make sense. The last two episodes seemed forced, as if they were trying to be overly clever instead of concluding in a format that made sense. Even several scenes historically seemed to make no sense based on decisions made. Ultimately, this remains one of the greatest television series of all time, so I had to score it a 10/10, even with it's complete failure of a conclusion. I strongly, strongly recommend seeing this.",literal
"Character wrong size - puts interactions off Actors are good.

Just like Tom Cruise trying to play ""reacher"" this Jethro is taller than all other cast members when the Gibbs in the original was shorter than most. Makes the scenes discordant with the character interaction.

Like the cruise ""reacher"" movies the acting is good but the fact that the actor playing Gibbs is the wrong size keeps getting in the way of the story being told.

Whoever made that decision should have made a better choice; just like the ""Reacher"" tv series actor; just as good actor; much better size fit for the storyline based on the character developed in the original NCIS series based on Mark Harmon's size. Too bad the developers compromised.",literal
An absolute favorite. This is fantastic. The writing is superb. It's a completely faithful adaptation of the source material. Beautifully acted. And let's be honest Cornwall is an amazing setting.,literal
"Original Entertaining - Pythonesque Spy drama My Review - Slow Horses My Rating- 9/10

Every large Government Department has its filing room or mail room that bosses can shove sideways the employees they consider unsatisfactory or require demotion to be exiled if they are deemed useless in their current role.

This great spy romp is about the equivalent last frontier for failed MI5 spy agents who for one reason or another botch up their mission.

This last outpost for failed British Intelligence Agents is headed by Jackson Lamb and brilliantly cast with Gary Oldman as the washed up seedy and incredibly belligerent boss . His surname is no indication of his personality I would think more of a drunken sloth than a lamb would suit his sarcastic but witty curmudgeonly personality.

Along comes River Cartwright also beautifully cast with Jack Lowden who after a very shady frame up is despatched to Jackson Lamb's team of ""slow horses"" by his shrewish MI5 boss Diana Tavener ( Kristin Scott Thomas) .

I always expect a quality production when Kristin Scott Thomas is in the cast and her duplicitous duet in this series with Gary Oldman is one of the the delights of this series for me.

New recruit River Cartwright is not content and frankly pissed off with the menial and demeaning tasks that his new boss Jackson Lamb assigns him and the rest of the slow horse team . Their working days are spent with menial tasks like the analysis of stinking rubbish collating parking fines or transcribing mobile phone conversations.

Against his bosses strict instructions of staying in the office and virtually doing nothing all day under the radar of the MI5 boss River Cartwright secretly joins in the MI5 surveillance hunt to save a young man threatened with beheading after being kidnapped by a terrorist cell.

The series weaves an intricate web with surprising and dramatic outcomes for all the characters with a mix of some delicious black humour.

There are many other delightful performances in Slow Horses including Saskia Reeves as Catherine Standish the world weary PA to Jackson Lamb and Sophie Okonedo the big boss of MI5 and the only person that can strike fear into the steely demeanour of Diana Taverner (Kristin Scott Thomas ) The other Slow Horses are all great characters in fact the whole ensemble cast help make this series enjoyable viewing one and the good news is series 2 was filmed at the same time and I hear Apple TV will screen it very soon.

The trio of Directors James Hawes, Jeremy Lovering and Saul Metzstein plus Will Smith and his team of 4 script writers have seamlessly and beautifully adapted the 2010 novel by Mick Herron no wonder this series already has been renewed for a third and fourth season.",figurative
"Amazing and jaw dropping I recently decided to check out The Pitt, even though it's not my usual type of show, and I am completely hooked. I went in with no expectations, thinking I'd maybe watch an episode or two and move on, but from the very first episode, I was captivated. Every single episode has either left my heart racing or completely dropped in shock. The emotional rollercoaster this show puts you on is unlike anything I've experienced in a long time.

One of the things that stands out the most to me is the acting. The performances in this show are nothing short of phenomenal. Every character feels so real, so raw, that I often forget I'm watching a scripted show. The actors bring their characters to life with such authenticity that it feels like I'm watching real people navigate the chaos of the emergency room. Whether it's a high-stakes medical emergency, an ethical dilemma, or the emotional struggles of the staff, every moment is portrayed with a depth that makes it impossible to look away.

Another aspect that I absolutely love is the realism of the ER setting. Many medical dramas try to capture the fast-paced and high-pressure environment of a hospital, but The Pitt does it in a way that feels incredibly authentic. The background, the procedures, the way the doctors and nurses interact-all of it adds to the immersive experience. The show doesn't shy away from the harsh realities of working in emergency medicine, and I appreciate the attention to detail in how they depict both the triumphs and tragedies that come with the job.

What really sets this show apart for me is how it dives into the mental and emotional toll that working in the ER takes on the staff. It's not just about the patients and the medical cases; it's about the people behind the scrubs and how they cope with the weight of their responsibilities. You see them struggle, you see them break, but you also see their resilience. The show does a phenomenal job of exploring the psychological impact of constant high-stress situations, and it makes you appreciate just how much these professionals go through every day.

The storytelling is another reason I'm so hooked. The way the show balances intense, heart-stopping moments with deep, emotional character development is masterful. Every episode leaves me on the edge of my seat, desperate to know what happens next. Just when you think you have a moment to breathe, something shocking happens that changes everything. The pacing is perfect-there's never a dull moment, and every scene feels like it has a purpose.

At this point, I'm impatiently waiting for each new episode to be released. It's the kind of show that sticks with you long after you've finished an episode, making you think about what's coming next and how the characters will deal with their ever-growing challenges. I find myself constantly wanting to talk about it, analyze the characters, and predict what might happen next. It's rare for a show to grip me this hard, especially one outside my usual preferences, but The Pitt has done exactly that.

I can't recommend this show enough. Whether you're into medical dramas or not, The Pitt is worth watching. It's intense, emotional, and deeply compelling, with incredible performances and storytelling that will keep you hooked from the start. If you're looking for a show that will make you feel every emotion possible, this is it. 100% worth watching.",figurative
"I saw it coming... OMG, that was pain full or full of pain, but we watched the entire 30 minutes. We might give the next episode another chance, don't know why. I mean what kind of entertaining comedy can be drawn out of the backdrop that is the DMV? A couple of the characters were just ok. The jokes were absolutely flat except for the bra joke. I really try to not be negative in my reviews, but.......",literal
"Stellar cast. Disappointing storyline. Palm Royale features an exceptional cast led by Kristen Wiig, Allison Janney, and Laura Dern, along with a talented ensemble. Despite their admirable performances, the characters fail to engage or hold my interest-I found myself not connecting with or caring about any of them. Even the impressive production design can't compensate for the disjointed storyline lacking any substance. As much as I was looking forward to this Apple+ series, the 5 out of 10 episodes I painstakingly attempted to watch left me questioning its direction and quite frankly, very disappointed and annoyed. Despite the significant effort poured into its creation, Palm Royale ultimately falls short of expectations. It's truly a shame considering how much effort and money went behind the production and marketing.",literal
"Refreshing non-copoganda southern noir Seeing Peter Dinklage ready to fight neo-nazis 1 on 3 in the middle of the street at broad daylight, is the kind of punk this show aims for, and it's so refreshing when most mystery/detective/noir shows always try to paint the authorities as the good guys. Well this show takes a whole different approach.

The formula of this show is a bit curious, because each episode has some choice guest appearances that you then seemingly say goodbye to pretty quickly, maybe after 1 or 2 episodes and then they're never to be seen again. It's obviously still too early to tell if this is actually how it is, but it would be a shame if that's the case as all the talent is amazing.

On the other hand, it helps paint a picture of the environment in a unique way, almost like the story was written from the point of view of someone close to the main protagonist who only knew the people indirectly. Like if you ever tagged along with your parent and met some of their friends that one time and that's all the impression of them you ever got.

And since this show is about an eccentric writer and his relationship to primarily his daughter, I can see how the show might written in this way for a reason not yet uncovered. Time will tell.

Definitely worth a watch for people that don't enjoy the usual copoganda slop, but do enjoy uncovering a mystery.",figurative
"Needs Some Changes Why does Hollywood use the same old formula whenever they start a series where a genius has insights with evidence that others miss? They can't be normal with high intelligence. They need to have some odd condition that makes them quirky in some manner. Unless it's an updated Sherlock Holmes then he's just plain a jerk to most people he comes into contact with. The genius here is pretty so naturally she being a genius with three children is going to fashion herself so she looks like a street walker. Her mind is like an encyclopedia, but apparently her real expertise is in all things related to what a domestic cleaning lady knows. None of that is necessary. She has a famil to create enough actual back story without making her an oddball. Start letting her dress nice without looking like a lot lizard down at the truck stop. Watching her solve things is the real attraction after all..",literal
"Such a fun show! We are loving Ghosts.

Having been a fan of Rose McIvor for some time, I was looking forward to this show. It didn't disappoint.

We love both the husband and wife team and the ghosts. While some viewers may not like the husband, he's a great foil for the wife's exuberance. She's the gas, he's the brakes.

Ghosts is just plain enjoyable. While we like shows that make us think and try to figure everything out, sometimes we just want a show to entertain us and make us laugh. Ghosts fills that bill.",literal
Wow! I love this show... The only problem I have with it I wish there was more episodes. Don't understand all the negative reviews on it are they watching the same thing that I'm watching? Ruffalo is a great actor so is the guy that plays Robbie he was on Ozark and he does a tremendous job here acting way to go HBO.,literal
"Like it cept for Gabby I got into this as some of the actors I've seen from other shows. I do enjoy the show. But I really can't stand Gabby! It's all about her, she is bossy, rude, disrespectful, does whatever she wants to whoever & whenever & then justifies her actions She ruined it for me The rest of the cast are good",literal
Binged all 6 episodes tonight. I have to admit that I am not a big fan of Glenn Powell and when I saw the trailer I thought NOPE AINT GOING TO WATCH..but for some reason I took a chance and tuned in one episode lead to another then another.. it's silly and nonsensical but I enjoyed every minute..Glenn was great and I may have to tune into some more of his performances.,literal
"It's NOT A Predator Movie to Me Just finished watching this movie, and I can't say I loved it. While the plot is pretty safe and generic, to me it's never a Predator movie. The human characters have always been important in the previous entries in the franchise, and they've always been the preys. In this movie the Predator is the protagonist, and the human (well, synthethic) character is now the ally. This means the horror element, which made the first movie so iconic, is gone from this movie. While this movie has tons of actions scenes, the suspense is nonexistent. It's just too safe. Contrary to its title, there's no predator here, and there's no prey too. There's no hunt even though that was the very thing our protagonist set out to do in this movie. Instead of a hunt, our protagonist actually went on a rescue mission. While this is not the worst movie in the franchise, it's still hugely disappointing to me. Watchable yes, but disappointing nonetheless.",literal
Heck yessss Where is season 2 already!? I am ready and waiting. I really think this show is awesome! Taylor did amazing with this show. It was really really good. Keeps you on your toes. I am excited for season 2 to come tho I know we got a while before it comes out but I will be waiting !!!,literal
"Great show with a view Ok, yeah, Colton Shaw is very handsome so that's number one. The show also incorporates gorgeous views of natural settings (he tends to stay in midwest and western areas for the most part).

But also, this is a really easy show to follow, reminiscent of old school crime shows like Renegade, Knight Rider, Simon to Simon, or any show where the loner goes from town to town solving folks' problems. In a world where so much is going wrong, it's nice to take a break and watch peole get closure. It's not anything new but the show is well constructed and the action adds excitement! I really love it and am looking forward to season 2!",literal
"Funny & Touching !!!SPOILERS!!!

Just finished watching Chad Powers twice. Loved it. Had to give my 2 cents. Although it's been promoted as a comedy, to me it felt much more like a dramady like Ted Lasso, one that digs into the emotional and psychological reasons behind why he does what he does, and how it changes him along the way.

Love the sidekick mascot/fabu friend, he adds balance and helps to ground Russ, giving us a glimpse into who Russ (and Chad) really is beneath the disguise.

I actually found myself loving the Chad Powers character, Glen Powell played him so convincingly that I almost wished he were real. In fact, when the coach's daughter found out the truth and said she was pissed because he murdered her friend, I completely understood. Well done, Glen!

Glen Powell's performance was remarkable; he made the duality of Russ and Chad believable, layered, and even tender at times. I honestly think this role could earn him awards.

As far as I'm concerned, Chad Powers was a solid first-year outing. If they lengthened each episode by about 15 minutes to explore the characters more deeply, it could go from great to exceptional.",literal
"It is truly one of the best shows! I didn't plan on watching this show, but I received a clip from season 6 episode 18 and I had to watch the rest. It's one of those shows where each episode is a new crime (unless it's a multiple part case). You also have the characters themselves and their lives playing as the show progresses and it's a perfect melange. The reason I'm even writing this review is because I saw the rating and wanted to raise it to the amount I believe it deserves haha. I would highly recommend this to anyone and everyone!

I also must say that Spencer and Garcia are my favourites! If they both stopped being in the show I would have stopped watching it.",literal
"Fun reunion. Meh film This has been years in the making and it's finally come out! Was it worth it? I suppose it was fun with the gang back together but it's more of the same you've seen before but less complex which is both a good and bad thing as the tricks are more realistic but it loses that intrigue and mysticism. Aside from that it springs a new generation of magicians along with the classic gang and watching them work side by side up until the big reveal is engaging. They clearly have fun with getting them all back together and the interactions after years make this worth a watch for sure. It leaves room for more at the end but they could stop right there if they wanted to.

The cast is the best thing with them all reunited. I love Jesse Eisenberg so I enjoy seeing him again. Newcomers like Justice Smith, Dominic Sessa and Ariana Greenblatt are all great charismatic new characters too. Rosamund Pike as the villain is cool just cause it's her anyway.

They have the song abracadabra in this by Lady Gaga so that's another cool thing!

Great to see them back on screen again regardless of it being more of the same stuff with less complexity.",literal
"Fails at world building and emotional connection I was excited for this movie. I loved the fanfare, which the trailers and IMAX intros threw into my face for weeks and months. Than I sat in my IMAX theatre and was deeply bored. Here's why:

1. There's no chemistry between the actors and I don't feel any genuine emotion.

2. We get a bit of world building at the beginning, but they just tell us a bit of a story. That's not enough to get a feeling of this world and feel connected. That's especially disappointing because I had high hopes for this retro futuristic parallel world.

3. Music is generic.

4. They once again used the ""mud filter"", so everything looks like different shades of grey. It's really hard to create picture which constantly looks too dark in an IMAX theatre, but they nailed it.

5. Villain is not interesting, is generic and absurdly slow. Despite both four being deeply underpowered for a being which existed before our universe existed and eats planets for a living, they manage to shove him into a conveniently still active wormhole and are done.

All of these points result in a missing connection with everything: World, characters, story, cgi baby. I just did not care.

That's even more sad because Thunderbolts delivered: We got an interesting story, a team, a deeper meaning and overall a movie which worked, was fun and never boring. Regarding ""boring"", even Superman was able to deliver a better world building and characters than Fantastic Four: We care because the relationship between Superman and Lex is shown. We understand it. We want Superman to win. And we are happy when he wins and monologues about what it means being human. None of such moments are present in Fantastic Four.

They had a chance creating an outstanding movie in an exciting parallel world, but somehow, they chose not to.",figurative
"Probably the last season I watch Season 1&2 were relatively ok, but season 3 was just infused with way too much emotion. Also i fell like Hopper lost all the character development we saw all through the previous seasons and the show is also too focused on relationships ie mike/eleven and max/lucas. I actually didn't finish the season",literal
"Great family movie Brilliant really enjoyed this family movie. It's probably more for teenage children due to the language. My family really enjoyed it. Good cameos. Like Kevin James of course. The actor was new to us, but our children knew who he was. He was so good. There were so many funny things. I think it's great to watch lighthearted action.",literal
"Surprisingly Good! We've been NCIS fans since it started, so the thought of anyone else playing Gibbs was a bit daunting. But we were pleasantly surprised, there was a definite familiarity to the away the stories were told, fresh enough to keep us entertained and the odd twist that left us gasping.

Seeing some of our old familiar characters in their prime, watching watching thwir back stories mingled witj what we already know from original series flashbacks helped tie it all together.

Best of all, it was a decent length! None of this 8-10 episode rubbish, 19 episodes long, decent old fashioned long series and we very much thank NCIS makers for that.",literal
"Jackie Chan Power Indeed this is the best Jackie Chan movie of the decade. There's parkour, elevator hand-to-hand, parachute, espionage, terrorism, 1v1, 1v2, 1v50, AI, hacking, tailing, anti-tailing and so much more riveting action sequences that simply doesn't seem to end. Jackie Chan and Tony Leung, two of Hong Kong's finest actors with a combined age of 138, are the absolute highlights of the film. The former agelessly humorous, masterful, and unwavering against evil; the latter charismatically menacing, conflicted, and a real beast when it comes to dagger play and family betrayal. Younger performers are also commendable whether Zhang Zifeng or Ci Sha, who all seem heavily trained for their stunts and convincing emotionally. For the down sides, I can bet that 90% of this movie's budget went to actors and action scenes because everything else was truly average - soundtrack, special effects, editing. It's almost giving a really good Internet-created action series. But still, The Shadow's Edge was an entertaining watch that took me back to Jackie Chan's time of prime action genre.",literal
Frustrating movie The person who cares for the main character and did the most things for her gets screwed over even though he did nothing wrong. But the junkie who dosen't do anything ends up being the main character love interest and ends up winning in the end even though he totally didn't deserve a good ending.,literal
"Missed opportunity with an outstanding performance by Tatiana Maslany I enjoyed the tense atmosphere in the theatre, but there were too many loose ends and unexplored parts of the character's backstories. In a way it felt like I watched two movies; the first hour and change, and whatever that ending was. With that said, Tatiana Maslany's performance was incredible and made the movie worth watching despite its many shortcomings.",literal
Serviceable thriller by old Neeson's standard Serviceable thriller drama by old Liam Neeson's standard. His chemistry with young Perez was decent enough. Robert Lorenz could've done more than formulaic suspense and action sequences here. Mexican Cartel especially Raba poised a threat through intimidating act.,literal
"Awful When a film says 'Directed by Lynne Ramsay' then that is a forewarning that its going to be rotten.

Due to the cast though I stupidly decided to watch it.

My mistake, although I will say this about the director, she is consistent.

All her films are putrid.

How she gets directing gigs is a mystery, but to be fair to Ramsay, Kelly Reichardt also gets to do the same, and that is just as much of a mystery.",literal
"Despite plot twists, it's the usual p.c. nonsense -- and thus, in a way, predictable Like so many other TV thrillers nowadays, this opens with a terrorist incident: an explosion on a British aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf that leaves 41 crewmen dead. Evidence points to the Iranians, and in the real world they might well be the culprits. But that would be too easy. It's a general rule in the world of politically correct TV, especially lately, that such incidents have to turn out to be false-flag operations, the work of -- surprise! -- white supremacists, a right-wing politician, a ruthless mega-corporation, or else some entity within the government. And when the British prime minister is played by Rory Kinnear (who has played the PM before), it's not hard to see where this eight-part series is likely going; he's clearly a treacherous character. Granted, however, his guilt remains somewhat speculative, since the season concludes, annoyingly, with a cliffhanger.

It's also not surprising that, in this series, the really competent staffers at the U. S. Embassy and in the British government -- the smart, savvy insiders who make the wheels go round -- are women and people of color and another of peculiar indistinct gender, although one woman politician is singled out as a ""racist."" But then, she's a Tory, so what do you expect!

P. S. My friend has pointed out an odd thing: the total absence of the Royal Family. The title character never presents herself to the monarch, and indeed there's no mention of the monarchy at all. Is this series set in a future Britain that has dumped its traditional rulers?",literal
"Overfamiliar but watchable (much like Ethan himself) Except for a few exceptions like ""Training Day,"" ""Sinister"" and ""Moon Knight"" Ethan Hawke tends to play the same wide-eyed, aging Austin hipster (himself) over and over again, and this shaggy detective series looks more suited for Nick Nolte thirty years ago. But with a top-shelf (even if they can't reach it. Sorry) cast like Dinklage, Keith David and Jean Tripplehorne it at least holds your attention, and I always like when forgotten Midwestern cities are used for noir locales (and it's not like you can understand what Stallone is saying on his Tulsa show). Sure better than this Rosario Dawson series I was an extra on years ago; got so mired in sub-David Lynchian tone it was like watching a tortoise race. The Hawkman Cometh for The Lowdown! Or something.",literal
"Animation at its best! Now Officially one of my Favorite Movies! As an individual double majoring in Computer Science and Creative Writing (with a focus on screenplays) I have to say that Moana was one of the best Disney Movies that I have ever watched! In fact, I was astonished by its storyline along with its animations that it became one of my favorite movies and ended up buying my own Moana doll for Christmas!

SPOILERS: In particular, I truly enjoyed the scenes where Moana gained the confidence to go out there and voyage into the sea even though her dad Tui wanted her to focus on being the chief for her people. The first time she went out didn't end so well (I was laughing so hard when Moana's Grandma said that whatever she did that she blamed in on the pig, Pua, which in fact, is one of the most adorable characters that Disney has ever created!), but I admire the confidence that she showed. This confidence showed me that we as individuals are truly individuals. 

I also loved the scene where Maui was trying to turn into the Hawk when he and Moana were trying to get the hook from Tamatoa's shell. It was hilarious to see him turn from a fish, to a shark, then a chameleon etc, then finally back to his human form. It made it even funnier when Tamatoa was saying that Maui was having trouble with his look as he was singing ""Shiny.""

All and all, I can't think of anything wrong with this movie. This is one of the Disney Movies that I can watch over and over again!",literal
"Actually Sneaky Sufrace simple and fun, while complex in depth..

The Brotherhood definitely knows way more than their higher ranks reveal, as they organised this large and long range mission, independent of other factions, with their own resources, intel, etc. All that is distracted from by low grunt perspective.

Corporations meeting shows Barb Howard, who runs one of Vault Tec Divisions, with the Enclave or otherwise ""captured"" by The Enclave, which is a shadow organisation that, amongst other, wants to prepare for what they see as inevitable end of already failed civilisation, and to create a new one on their own image, using corporations as ""the vessel"" for projects necessary, and that is why Bud Askins, and similar other, talk about time, management, investment, experiments, etc, while Barb Howard talks about The Vault that oversees all other..",literal
"""The Running Man"" is also a thinking man. ""I'm not into politics; I'm into survival."" - Ben Richards 

It's rather funny – well, scary – how ahead of its time ""The Running Man"" was when it came out 22 years ago. Since its release, reality TV has become the norm, as audiences tune in week by week to watch people humiliating and sometimes endangering themselves for a payday. In the film, it's convicts and the outcasts of society who are thrust into the game, given a chance to earn their freedom that almost always ends in death. A bit skewed from the reality-TV of today, but as our culture progresses, it can't help but feel like this is what we are building towards. The film seems to stumble upon these themes by accident, though, inadvertently becoming relevant to today's times.

At its core, ""The Running Man"" is less of a socially conscious techno-thriller and more of a prototypical 80's Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle. All the trademarks are there -- from the one-liners and puns to the over-the-top action and stunts-- to make it an Arnie classic. Everyone's favorite Austrian is in top form, and is matched by the lovely Maria Conchita Alonso as a love-interest who is thrust into the game when she makes enemies with the government. Arnie's ""Predator"" co-star and also-future-politician Jesse Ventura has a bit part as one of the bad guys and hams it up appropriately and while it's nice to see Yaphet Kotto in another sci-fi classic, he isn't given much to do. The direction by Paul Michael Glaser is adequate and captures the zany action nicely, but the film can't help but look and feel dated, especially when it comes to wardrobe choices and the music in the film. This can be forgiven, though, as many 80's flicks have fallen victim to the same things.

Even though the imagery and technology within the movie doesn't exactly resemble the future we are living in today, its themes sure do, and that's what makes ""The Running Man"" worth coming back to time and time again. It's more intelligent than the average bear, and aside from having Arnie in his prime, has enough social commentary to stimulate the brain and keep it feeling fresh. Hopefully reality-TV doesn't go this far South, but if it does, Arnold Scwarzenegger and company will be there to say ""I told you so."" As for me, I'm betting on a remake sometime in the next few years.",figurative
"L-7 Weenie! This movie is a complete classic. Tom Guiry is great as the part of Scott Smalls, and the movie smoothly moves from one great subplot to the next in this great adventure about a nerdy child who experiences the summer of his life through the summer baseball group he joins in the summer.

It's absolutely portrayed in the style that it will never get old. Certain things were meant to die out, but this film will remain a kid flick forever. From Wendy Peffercorn puckering up to Squints to following your heart, you'll follow this movie right to the end (although it's follow-up wasn't that bad). The planning of the movie is perfect, and it's setting in 1962 sets up the fantasy in all of us. Beating snotty baseball rivals in a pickup baseball game, hitting your first Home Run, learning to throw, making smores, spooky ""camp outs"", the unknown neighbor Mr. Mrtyle ""the meanest old man that ever lived"" that was the perfect summer. Too bad those days are just about wiped out, because those were the days.

The classic summer? More like the classic movie. If your into a lot of wacky adventure, slapstick comedy, and where mystery has never gone before, try this one, it's a guarantee plus.",figurative
"Silly, weird, mindlessly fun This brand new movie came out the day I saw it. I had no idea going in what to expect. Early on I kept asking what is this movie? It's totally insane and that's when I realized it was just so weird and out there. That's what makes it so good. It's totally trying to be serious while getting more and more absurd with every scene.

I loved this movie and I wouldn't change anything. It takes time to develop itself and not everyone will be on board with it. If you get in on the joke and can stay invested you'll love this but if you don't like stupid silly fun you will hate this.

I hope they make a sequel. 8/10 from me.",literal

"Bad writing mediocre acting. I don't know what is worse, the writing or the acting. For instance, in one episode a nuclear facility inspector has been murdered, when the FBI team shows up to the victim's apartment, they find an person in the apartment who says she is also an inspector and was stocking the refrigerator. The agents don't question this person any further, no ""let's see some identification"".""No ""let's look in the refrigerator."" Nothing to verify who this person is or WTH she's doing in this murdered person's apartment. Every episode is so guilty of this shallow Hallmark channel writing and acting, that I want to throw something at the tv, but end up changing the channel a third of the way into the episode. Tell the writers to stay on strike until they can write something besides this drivel.",literal
"Worth a rewatch I first watched this in 1985 on VHS as a 13 year old, so a lot of the sentiment was lost on me then. Having watching it again as a 50 year old after finding it on the BBC iplayer I decided to give it another go. I have to say that it was way more enjoyable now. It really brought back the feeling of being an awkward teenager and the fantasy of being guided through adolescence. There were a few quirks with the story but this can be overlooked by how the sensitivity of being an awkward teenager can be is portrayed. I do think the bones of the story could be updated for a remake that could possibly make more sense but still be a fun movie.",literal
"Great Action Movie/Comedy The story to this movie was very different and creative. Even though people say it is a James Bond rip off, it is some way very different. The action scenes in this movie was great. Well done. A great cast for this movie. Vin Diesel was great for this part. I can't wait for the sequel to this movie. I am defiantly going to see it. It will probably be another great experience!!",literal
"Interesting exercise in style I have never read a Jacqueline Susann novel, but I have also seen Valley of the Dolls, based on another of her books. On both occasions I thought the movie is probably better than the book and will further improve with age (certainly contrary to the books). The reason being that a movie focuses more on a specific style in fashion, design and behavior patterns. And in this aspect The Love Machine offers quite a lot. The set design fits the story perfectly. And all the characters fit in, too. They're perfect in the way that they complete a well balanced general picture. They are superficial and do not develop, it is true, but in this movie I wouldn't want it any different.

David Hemmings reprises the role he played in Antonioni's Blow Up. And it's more than a rip-off. He's a fashion photographer, looks visibly aged and seems to start going slightly to seed. Robert Ryan reprises the role he played in Max Ophül's Caught, he is Smith Ohlrig all over again, greedy, bored and boring, uninspired and uninspiring. It's possible Ryan did not want to be in this picture and acted accordingly, on the other hand he might have thought a lot about his part and then given a carefully studied performance. Whatever happened, it fits the picture. Dyan Cannon is great (fantastic wardrobe!), she dominates every scene she's in and is involved in the two highlights of the movie: the burning of a luxurious bed and the knocking down of the Hemmings character with a Academy Award statuette.

The title, The Love Machine, is, of course, meant ironically. Robin Stone is a kind of a Barry Lyndon of the pop era (incidentally, the movie IS slightly kubrickysh). That he chooses a TV station to work his way up to the top seems to be a mere coincidence. He sees love (meaning sexual favors) merely as a means for personal advancement. There are rather scary hints of a troubled sexuality which are not explored in the movie. Homosexuality is treated very casually, probably not the standard for mayor movies of the period. The open cynicism of the TV executives need not fear comparison with other good movies about the subject like A Face in the Crowd or Network or Truman Show. They are producing crap, they agree among themselves it's crap and they know they will make a lot of dough with it.

I did not regret spending the odd 108 minutes with this movie and would not be surprised if it picked up a cult following, provided it's given the chance (meaning a DVD release).",figurative
"Looks nice...and thats it really. My god, what is it with superhero films these days? They are just so lacklustre.

After the first trailer, I was unimpressed. I was really not keen on seeing the film, but then my son asked, and we also got to see Galactus in the last trailer, so I thought we would go for it. Even if Galactus is cool and the rest sucks, that would be something.

The film looks great; they nail the comic book look, and I cannot really fault it in that regard. Sadly, that's about it. The CGI ranges from passable to excellent, the script is very dumb in parts....but passable. The ""female"" Silver Surfer was fine; there was a plot point that made the Surfer's gender a necessary story element. The casting just felt off, not terrible, but something did not click.....And worst of all was the utter waste of Galactus.

Going by trailers, it looked like we would finally get some full-on action, but (no real spoiler apart from what he does) what we get is chatty Galactus, ""ouch"" Galactus, and walking past buildings Galactus....... Oh, and one other Galactus that made it even worse.

I have to say, right up to the Space trip and meeting (trying to keep details low), I was pleasantly surprised, and I did start to get my hopes up. Lesson learned, I guess.",literal
"Total Reality I've always hated ""medical shows"" because they are completely unrealistic think of ""House"". This is the most authentic series I've ever seen. It shows what actually goes on in an ER. (BTW I'm a retired RN so i kind of know how this stuff works) If you are at all squeamish don't watch, the meatball surgery sequences are gory. It's also done in real time. All the actors were totally believable.

There's humor, and humanity both good and bad.

Spoiler Alert:

The scenes after the mass shooting were gut wrenching. Maybe someone will stop and think before they pick up an AK 47

Kudos to Noah Wylie.",literal
Third season sucks They should finish with season 2. Loved first two hated the third.,literal
"Apple Does It Again There seems to be a pattern with Apple TV shows. Take a compelling idea, in this case a procedural about finding a rogue spy in the wilderness, and drive it into the ground with subplots piled upon subplots (let's put the spy on a plane filled with homicidal prisoners, let's throw a missing child into the mix-wait, let's make it three children all with different parents, let's make sure our people leading the search have dark secrets in their past (that would be original, right?)). I'm only three episodes in so it might turn itself around but the odds are it's going to crash and burn like the prisoner transport plane in the first ten minutes of this thing.",literal
"does come across as B version of white lotus. I agree with most of the reviews here . The animal killing is a lame plot device when done more than once and it seemed pretty unnecessary to advance the plot. . But the animals are not really being killed, as one reviewer seems to think. But it does come across as a weak version of white lotus. Duchovny is still great, he should have waited to appear in the real thing. Are there plot holes, apart from the fact that the tanner family have not noticed that their lives have taken a turn for the worse since Adam arrived. Adam does come across as too creepy and unlikeable to be kept on as a manny. If you see Dan Stevens in The Guest , he gets it right, you even find your self liking him The show is only 6 parts so i will stick it out to the end.",literal

"you do NOT cross the codys Wow this show was friggin INCREDIBLE, the casting, the acting, the dialogue i NEVER got bored. Shoot outs, heists, loyalty, betrayal, drugs, booze, action, car chases, twists and turns, pure adrenaline. This show has all of these combined I just always felt so excited to check out the next episode. In the first 2(maybe 3) seasons the show felt like it always lead up to one big heist as the season finale, but that formula seemed to change after that. It felt a little less about the ""big score"" and focused more of the characters and tinier scores here and there. Like a ""score of the week"" formula. Nothing wrong with that, but i did prefer the other way.

I dont think i had a favorite character simply cause all of the codys and a majority of the side characters were all just so bad a**. The cody brothers would constantly bust one anothers ""family jewels"" maybe even beat the sh** out of each other, but they would be settled and pretty much over it within 10 minutes and no matter what always had each others backs. The codys were a family no one should EVER cross. The only people i think would stand a chance is petes gang. Pete was a cool guy sometimes. I was so glad he took care of tupi and J took care of mia for what they did to the codys.

The cody family consists of...

smurf(janine): a cunning, manipulative, blunt, and callous mother/grand mother who didnt give a s*** what anyone thought and would put a bullet in you without a second thought if you lost her trust one time.(loved the backstory to her nickname)

Craig: the tallest of the brothers, but not the toughest. Could dish out a hit just as hard as he could take one.

Deran: the brother who's there to watch your six. Can go toe to toe on his one, but i dont feel as if hes the scariest of the codys. My favorite scene was when he took those bullets for craig when they went to rescue nick. That hit hard for me sense they were recently in a brawl a few scenes before this.

Pope(andrew): along with smurf i would say hes the scariest. Hes a brute who takes no crap from anyone. You look at him the wrong way and youll end up in the hospital.(was so glad to finally see where he got the nickname pope)

baz: i dont really remember too much about him

J: the least scariest of the codys. He really stepped up in the last few seasons and i was rooting for him......until the final or final 2 episodes. I was rooting for me to have a happy ending. I would have preferred it to be with that other lawyer chick sense she knew his lifestyle, but once he was shown as betraying the codys i wanted him dead. Like i get wanting revenge for what smurf did his mom which i felt was so awful and none of the brothers helping him and/or her, but i think that kind of revenge shouldnt have been the ending sense i loved the codys family so much.

The show was going so strong until the ending. Im so mad pope allowed J to get away. I get WHY he did it cause i to am like pope in the way that ill sometimes blame myself for something later on and no longer be mad at the person i was mad at, but they could have had deran escape, find J, kill him and then meet up with renn and see deran helping raise nick. I think the ending should have also involved vince and his gang somehow as another twist as vince was such a cool dude. That ending would have been so much better with all of them alive and possibly J dead.",figurative
"Tomas Gibson was probably the reason this series was good It's so sad one of my fav series becomes like a soap opera.

Probably the most interesting character was Hotchner played by Tomas Gibson very well, the truth is between them but if you want to kill a character that goes on so many years at least make a new one and bring an actor who can do the job! Emily Prentiss head of BAU is sad and boring! Its not longer one of the best series, the new agents are also boring characters only Reid is interesting but yet you have to make his life like the Young and the Restless!

Probably Tomas Gibson and Mandy Patinkin was the good actors and now that they left is no longer good!

I want change the rating cause of the last 2-3series but it is sad.",literal
"Underrated-Brilliant And Quirky ""Dramedy""! I can't believe the rating isn't higher. I haven't turned on a show that has kept my attention like this one has in a while. It was so engaging that I kept finding myself staying up past midnight telling myself ""just one more episode and then it's time for bed"". Great character development, plot, acting, cast, and humor. Maxine is the type of character you really want to dislike initially but just end up developing a soft spot for. While the characters may seem a bit outrageous there really is truth behind their behavior in the real life circles they portray, just embellished a bit for entertainment. The writers have a brilliant sense of humor and I kept finding myself laughing out loud which I don't do often watching television. Can't wait for season 2..please renew this gem!",figurative

"Accomplished This show was made by people who know Fallout, and know what they want, and where they want to go, and know what they are doing. We can argue that the tone is mostly FO4, but it is obvious that that of all games is included, and games introduce changes that are not baseless, because even if games are ""selfcontained"" still all have to add-up propely as pieces of larger picture, while not all set on same locations, nor in time periods. Quite a change in the tone and slightly artstyle was introduced already between FO 1997, and FO2 1998, both made by the same studio, and set in approx same area, while with about 80+ years time difference. Some games while in same time period, are set on different locations, while FO4 is about 126 years after FO, and on the other side of the map. With that, changes are inevitable and natural. Pushing forward in time, while exploring different locations in different times, is other than War, the only thing that doesn't change, and that's where the TV show is, back to West and 10 years after FO4..

It's a complex, big world with long history and extensive lore, and quite some yet to explore and find out, and Fallout TV show, excellent as is, is a significant part of that..",literal
"Creepy, Interesting and well executed concept After a series of flops from Apple tv, this one hits it out of the park. Well acted, engaging and keeps you at the edge of your seat. I expected a comedy, but got a well written story with A+ actors. It has the style of a nordic series and the shots and pacing of one, but this one is very well done. So it does not have the drab dialogue delivery from Nordic series.

I feel it represents quite accurately to detail apple's own ecosystem (the white sterile environment where overly controlling big brother is watching your every kind of move) and how apple tends to treat its employees despite how well they are paid. Even computers look very applish.

So I am quite surprised that apple even allowed it onto its TV+. This series takes genuine inspiration from corporate America which is increasingly going in that direction (I hope it does not end up in the same place in a decade or two).",literal
"Pretty Good It's a solid show, but overhyped in my opinion. Bet it was peak television when it aired, but today the standards are much higher. The acting is great, plot lines are all over the place, but coherent. Sometimes they just throw you in the middle of something that might or might not be connected to something else.

Where the show lacks the most is building up to an event. Many times throughout the show the main characters or side characters for that matter do something huge plot line wise out of the blue without any foreshadowing or building up the hype to the said event. Another thing I'd say is missing is the dramatization of major scenes such as ""taking out"" a certain big character. That could be argued with how casual it was for the mobsters to do such things. I just judge show by how many emotions they can get out of me and honestly the Sopranos didn't do a great job in that department overall. Otherwise everything else was great. Loved the ending too.",literal
"Great, plain and simple I'm gonna keep this short: This is a great political thriller.

Keri and Rufus are really good. The supporting characters are all really good in their parts.

The escallation of things episode by episode makes you wanna watch more. Maybe the soundtrack needed a little more work, but no problem there.

Just imagine that things like that happen every once in a while in some place in the world, and this is quite scary if you think about it.

It was an nice surprise, following a couple more good shows on this network. We definitely need more good shows like this on Netflix.

Is this 600 words already?",literal
"so i have some questions While i understand that this could have been a really interesting movie i don't think it was portrayed in the best way. It left me with so much confusion and felt like a waste. Honestly not happy with it and i don't think i would ever watch again.

I watched the trailer to try and get an understanding of what i was walking in on but truly the dog, the horse, the forest, i assume they have a hidden meaning but the movie doesn't show it enough.",literal
"Better Than The First, But That's Not Saying Much. So, having walked away from the first Black Phone Film feeling ""meh"", I went into this one with low expectations. Even upon hearing about it being made & seeing trailers later on, my feelings were mixed, but, I was curious at the same time as it did look somewhat good...

As Finn, now 17, struggles with life after his captivity, his sister begins receiving calls in her dreams from the Black Phone & seeing disturbing visions of 3 boys being stalked at a winter camp known as Alpine Lake.

I found the film to be pretty good. Not amazing as it has its flaws, but, I did enjoy it much more than the first film. This one had not only more gore, way more gore, but, it had a body count to speak of. The setting is better, the snowy mountains makes for a creepy yet atmospheric backdrop.

The actors done well with their roles & the characters they play. There's some eye candy to be had as well as more action & creepy horror. I will say the film felt a bit rip off like of A Nightmare On Elm Street story-wise, not that it was completely a bad thing. Aside from that, I did enjoy this one & walked away thinking it was good.

The runtime is 1 hour & 48 minutes long (108 minutes) long & has not bad, but-could-be-better pacing. The first half of the film dragged somewhat & even other parts lingered on for longer than they needed to be. But, it wasn't all bad as the film holds a more darker & creepier vibe than the first.

Overall, it's a good film & better than the first Black Phone. While the films story is more or less a rip-off of A Nightmare On Elm Street, I will say this film is much better despite its own flaws & issues. It's gory, action packed & more darker than the first. But, it drags, it's a tad unoriginal & isn't exactly amazing, but I did enjoy it. Give it a watch.

7/10.",literal
"Great work, love the cast! The show had a slow start, many things are different from the original show, but it it makes sense to me; our past was different, and were different people then. That is what this show is about, telling where they came from and who they were then. I could use more of Mark's narrative, after all, he is why we are watching. Austin does have the baby blues of Gibbs and maybe Gibbs was taller back then, if you consider all the physical activity and injuries from the work over 20 plus years. I love Mark Harmon so I probably would watch anything he created. However, this show must stay close to the roots of Gibbs and his life, his career and people in his life that make him into the Gibbs we come to love in the original NCIS show. But, I, as a loyal viewer ask that you DON'T kill off anyone from the team! Their roles my change but please don't kill off anyone; family now! Their parts may move around, like Vera's did but she's still in the picture.

Thank you, Mark for not leaving viewers high dry. We still need quality shows like NCIS, please keep making them.",literal
"The last episode taints this series The first five episodes were great but the last episode tanked. I suspect two things: they got short on money, and 2, they modified the books' story to make a more politically correct ending. Those are my guesses and I could be wrong in both counts.

All of the acting was excellent. I really liked seeing Zahn Mcclarnon again since his days at Longmire, and he got the same role! I hope he enjoyed it as he does fine work. The entire cast was generally good. The scenic views were nice. The story lines included the right amount of Navajo customs to make it both informative and interesting.

The bad: 1) The trite and re-used story of a corrupt FBI agent. What!? Did they need to add another bad white guy to balance out the bad Indians?

2) The sudden ""redemptive heart"" of Hoski at the end? What!? Did they need to make the murderous Indian a better person before he kills himself? That was either real screwy or poorly done.

3) Nakai lives again! Having a rifle bullet go through your chest and running off carrying a heavy load of cash was unbelievable. That works in comic books or action movies but not here.

All in all I would have given the show a 9 but that last episode was such a drop off. I'm not sure what caused the producers/directors to drink a cup of stupid on this one. Both the actors and the fans deserve better.",literal
"Bob is my icon Bob Odenkirk does not get enough love when it comes to roles outside of Saul Goodman. This man is the writer of the famous Matt Foley SNL sketch so of course he can do funny. I watched the first Nobody just for fun back when it came out, plus I wanted to go through Bob's filmography. My hubby and I enjoyed it. We like action and we don't take movies too seriously. We just like to be entertained. And Bob always does this.

We just went and saw the sequel and we were entertained again. I personally couldn't stand watching Sharon Stone as that bat-crazy idiot of a boss. Now, I loved her back in the day (I was a teen in the 90s) and I love seeing women in strong roles, but she was just annoying. Saying the F bomb every sentence didn't make her look tough. It made her look like she was TRYING to be tough and that's a big difference. She just couldn't act.

Colin Hanks was disappointing as well. I thought he was a better actor than that, too, but oh well.

I liked everything else and I'm ready for Becca's back story because she held it down, too.

Can't wait to see what Bob will do next!",literal
"Douglas Sirk's sappy steak with Rock Hudson on the side By far one of the strangest 1950's Technicolor melodramas ever made, MAGNIFICENT OBSESSION put Rock Hudson on the map, and he's the best thing going: Especially since his character... a rich, spoiled young man who races a futuristic space shuttle-shaped racing boat... seems not only against the vapid premise, but justifiably fights back when he's blamed for... after suffering a horrible accident... being revived by use of a neighbor's defibrillator that winds absent to help said neighbor who, married to a brooding Jane Wyman, is some kind of New Age Messianic figure before Hollywood pushed such a thing...

This doctor, who winds up dead because of Hudson's near-deathly crash, was a horrible businessman who treated patients for free (a theme later progressed in PAY IT FORWARD), and if he'd lived a week longer would have gone broke in this embarrassingly idealistic yarn that goes over its own pretentious head preaching the glories of avoiding profits at all costs, per se, something that Hollywood preaches but never practices...

But what's truly banal about MAGNIFICENT OBSESSION is there's no obsession and nothing magnificent about it, although as searing melodramas go, it's quite unbelievably addictive as Hudson, serving the main plot, helps a much too old Wyman, who winds up blind... again because of him... while pretending to be someone else: Initially keeping the secret from angst-ridden daughter Barbara Rush. So if you want to see the 1950's in vibrantly painted-looking colors with locales ranging from a gorgeous lakeside community to bouts of European-like exteriors but mostly interiors, this is your bag. But prepare to bag on it as it simply begs the viewer to do so. Then AND now.",literal

"Not going to waste my time0 I love Sherlock Holmes and when Elementary came out I was a bit hesitant to watch it but because Jonny Lee Miller was it in I gave it a try. I thought it was great especially the twist of Watson being a woman Now for this new adaptation its definitely a NO!! I do like the actor playing Watson but as for the format it's like a revamp of House just with different actors. I didnt like house and I thought this was even worse with the most ridiculous characters ever.

I wont be wasting any more time on this show.

There can never be a Watson without a Sherlock as he is the one who drives the stories.",literal
"Annoyed at Cliffhanger I would give it slightly higher ratings were it not for the cliffhanger ending. It makes you feel like you've wasted your time.

The plot is mostly predictable. There is one surprise element but largely you can see where the movie is going from a mile away. However the storytelling and characters still make the journey enjoyable.

On a positive side, the acting was good all around. Yes, Glen Powell performs well but the most surprising was Steve Zahn. I will be following his career more after this.

All in all it was worth watching but the cliffhanger ending was super annoying.",figurative
"Mom act like a needy teen and daughter smart but stupid at the same time. At first i saw the mother/daughter relationship very nice, lovely, unique but watching the seasons I realized the mom act like a teen, the daughter best friend. The mom is so immature act like a little kid. The daughter is very smart when it comes to education but about taking life decisions she is extremely selfish and stupid. Sleeping with a married man? Wow! I feel really bad about the wife. I hope the ""Glimore Girls a year in their lives"" is better and she is less stupid but I heard she sleep with logan while he is engaged to another woman. Rory gets pregnant and dont who is the father? Im not surprised.",literal
"Still weighing Season 2 so far with its first part, is definitely not as good as season one.

Can't say it's bad, but not enjoying it so far, as enjoyed season one. There still is the second half of season 2 to watch, then to be more sure. Maybe it will step up, while if continues the trajectory of the first half, I might lower the score, and vice versa ofc

"Very poor cast selection Getting all the hype from a magnificent book and game series, this TV series tells an interesting story and provides insights in the Witcher background that are not touched on in the Witcher 3 game. However, the actor selection is just awful with many characters not looking anything like in the book (Yennefer, Triss and Fringilla are just way off the mark to the point of ridiculousness). I've been through the first seven episodes so far. I assume this cast is due to the ""race diversity"" point dominating the American culture but it just looks stupid. Being politically correct has nothing to do with screening a genuine story with actors the way the author envisaged them. Like if you shot a film about 2Pac, you wouldn't ask Eminem to play him, even if he had the best skill set, cause it would be ridiculous. Shameful.",literal
"A Fast and Engaging Samurai Ride!"" Last Samurai Standing was a really engaging ride from start to finish! The story moves very fast and never feels boring or dragged out. It beautifully captures the spirit of Japan's transformation and the end of the samurai era, showing both action and emotion in balance.

All the cast members did an excellent job - especially the little girl and the main character, who brought real heart to the story. The direction and screenplay were tight, keeping each role interesting and making sure there were no dull moments like in many other samurai shows.

Season 2 also wrapped up perfectly, though the story felt a bit short - it leaves you wishing for more. Overall, Last Samurai Standing is a must-watch for anyone who loves fast-paced historical drama with emotion, style, and energy.",literal

"On self-acceptance and demons in your head An entertaining family movie with a socially educational story, a creative artist writing their own lyrics -theme and with some basic positive psychological advice.

The story is metaphorically about how to use your voice for common good, and less metaphorically about how important it is to stop hiding your darker sides or wrong doings from your loved ones, or everyone. Accepting yourself and trusting your friends will bring the light, the movie promises.

If this movie actually courages people to accept themselves better and manage their anger and negative thoughts, it is a good story. The subject of dark and light or good and bad fighting is ancient. Thus the movie joins in the common but culturally and morally very central realm of ""let's fight for the good together"" stories.

As a movie, or as an art piece, it may be interesting at least for a) handling the issue of making art, in this case writing your own song lyrics, and b) mixing Korean and US cultures c) maybe something else, too, even if I did not get it because of my lack of knowledge of Korean culture or of animation as an art form or k-pop etc.

Furthermore, I was pleased to hear some Korean language in the lyrics, even though I did not understand any of it. It was very small amount. It is good to use and keep alive all languages before English will conquer the whole lingual world. Let's show some pride for our languages!",literal

"One of my favorite TV shows... I remember a time before I watched Grey's Anatomy. My Mum and sister would be watching it and I'd be like, ""Why are you watching this crap?"", but then one day, when I had nothing new to watch, I borrowed my sister's Season 1 DVD and it turned out that I really liked it. Since then, I've been a huge fan. And thankfully, it was about to start airing the ninth season, so I had a lot to catch up. As we speak I'm dreading that it won't be renewed for a twelfth season, but I'm praying that it will be. I honestly can't believe how much hate this show got a couple of weeks ago when they killed of Derek. I mean, I was sad, but come on people, it's a TV show. Get over it. Throughout this show at least ten major characters have come and gone. It's bound to happen again. My favorite season is probably Season 6, because Arizona and all the Mercy West people are main characters, which I loved. My favorite relationship is probably Alex and Jo, but that's not until like the tenth season.

This show takes place in Seattle, Washington, in a hospital. We see our main characters go through residency starting out as interns and then becoming attendings. We see people we love leave or die, and we see new relationships bloom as new characters come in. This show seriously made me think about becoming a surgeon, even though I know it's not completely realistic. I mean the doctors wear long sleeves and watches, which in a real hospital, they're not allowed to. But it didn't matter anyway, because I honestly don't have the brain capacity to remember all of those surgeries. 

Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.",literal
"Commands your attention with a steady flow of plot twists Make no mistake, this is a mini series worth watching. Many other reviewers have compared it to a book or film by a different name that I've never seen or heard of. I had absolutely no expectations whatsoever going in. Mind you, I am picky. I regularly turn off first episodes after only 2-3 minutes. Seriously. However, this story line is very well crafted and the actors are very well suited to their roles. Though, you have to wonder how they are as wealthy as they are at such a young age. That aside, you are immediately drawn in to their lives and you are drip fed their back stories bit by bit, just enough for you to question their motives and motivations and wonder whether each and every one had something (anything) to do with the kidnapped child. Truths are revealed over time and, of course, everybody has skeletons in their closets. It's a heart pounding ride to the very end, when you learn ""who dunnit"" and why. And rest assured, there is simply no way you guessed it in advance! The last two episodes are especially good. They grab you in the gut and keep you on the edge of your seat in a very visceral way. Buckle up! It's a wild ride.",figurative
"Redneck Lilyhammer Don't get me wrong, I really like this series and I've always loved Stallone. That being said, I also believe ""old dude"" Stallone is much more interesting than ""younger, hot"" Stallone. The only thing I don't like about Tulsa King is that it reminds me so much of Lilyhammer, I think Steve Van Zandt should be mentioned in the credits. Lilyhammer is on my list of all-time favorite shows. I love everything about it and I've watched it several times. So many, in fact, that it seems like I've already watched Tulsa King, as well. So far (2 eps in) it's like a scene by scene recreation. Good thing I needed a new series to obsess over, the bad thing is, I've already seen it. Hopefully, future episodes will be a little more original.",literal
"An excellent show from beginning to end It's tough to write 600 characters about a show that pretty much can be summed up with the above headline, but given that to write a review for IMBD, you now have to hit their character count, here are the things that make this show so good: The writing, the direction, but above all, the acting. Everyone is superb, but Gary Oldman gives the kind of bravura performance you rarely see these days; he plays someone you can't stand and yet you also want to see more of him. Hard to pull off. Jack Lowden is able to pull off another trick: the young hero, he's the least interesting character given that young heros are seldom the best, but he has more than enough charisma to pull off the role perfectly. The others are all good, but special kudos to the always underused Saskia Reeves, who is just perfect in her role, and, perhaps most of all, Brian Vernel, who seems like he was born to play villains, and he does it with panache.

Given the snappy direction, fast paced action, and spot-on dialog, and it's a 10 star show.",literal
"Strong first 20 minutes, then becomes more and more of a trainwreck I am not familiar with Chris Stuckmann as a movie critic, but if this is what he thought was acceptable to put out then it tells me all I need to know about his critiquing abilities.

Shelby Oaks starts off strong, mixing mockumentary and Riley's YouTube channel footage to set the story up. After the first 20 minutes or so, both of these elements go right out the window.

Once the second act starts, the film goes through just about every horror movie trope you can think of, including incredibly clichéd jump scares and Mia making increasingly stupid decisions. I understand suspending your disbelief a bit when it comes to a character's decision making in horror movies, but Mia was so idiotic that it really took me out of the movie at times. Her husband ""taking time for himself"" was the best decision made in the entire movie.

The third act is where the movie really falls apart and felt like Stuckmann asked ChatGPT to write an amalgamation of every ""evil satanic baby"" movie. As if the movie wasn't already disappointing enough, the ending was utter garbage. It basically makes the entire rest of the movie feel completely pointless and like a total waste of time.

I feel so bad for the people who funded this movie. Imagine believing so much in someone's project and vision that you give them funds to bring it to life, only for them to create this disappointing mess.",figurative
"Campy adult fun Hazbin Hotel is a show that is brimming with it's own personality and creativity.

I saw the pilot back in 2019 and was instantly hooked, when I heard it was getting picked up by Prime Video I was very excited.

Characters are very well thought out and the songs are absolutely catchy, I still find myself singing to them, ""Loser Baby"" and ""Stayed Gone"" are amazing.

Despite my nine star review, the show is still not perfect. The gripes I have with it will mostly get resolved in future seasons, my main one is I don't think the characters got enough development or screen time, now I know this is mostly due in part to the eight episode limit, but could they at least up the runtime of them? I also felt like the humor could be....a little better? Most of it is just swearing or sexual jokes which I get it, if your show takes place in Hell you'd expect the characters to say raunchy stuff and out of pocket things but at some point it stopped being funny. They are funny sometimes don't get me wrong, but it does start to get a tad dull.

With all that aside, Hazbin Hotel is a very fun musical adventure and I can't wait for season 2!",literal
"A very good piece of work Good television is still being made. And HBO is still in the business of making good series like ""Task"".

We all like Mark Ruffalo. A seasoned actor with great credentials- this one shows some of his great range. His portrayal of a grouchy, drinks too much, priest becomes FBI agent, is believable, heartfelt, and engaging.

The casting helps: somehow all of these actors have an amazing regional Pennsylvania/Philadelphia accent.

But beyond that, the producers picked people that figured out the essence of the situation they find themselves in as characters and convince us of it too.

I actually thought I was watching the final in sixth episode only to realize there is one more. I'm very much looking forward to that.

But as your journey through the episodes, you'll find a well put together story that spends a little need of time on our fragility and humanity. Particularly during a time when empathy end joy seems scarce.

I don't know if they can convince Mark Ruffalo to do another distinct season, but I would love to see one. I would think a prequel exploring Tom Brandis's career as an FBI agent would be a good way to handle more programming.",figurative
"For Anyone Who Loves a Cry, a Hug, and a Pretty Frame Okay, full disclosure: I know full well I'm so biased on this one, but I really enjoyed 'Regretting You'. From the moment the first frame rolled I was drawn in - visually it's gorgeous, the leads are absolutely stunning, and yes, my heartstrings were tugged. Any film that gets a tear out of me instantly gets a higher rating in my book, haha.

I'll admit: I've read the book (by Colleen Hoover) so there was extra nostalgia and expectation baked in. The film adaptation doesn't always dig as deep as one might hope - some character arcs feel glossed over, some of the emotional beats just skim the surface. Critics have flagged uneven storytelling and tonal whiplash. But honestly? For me it didn't matter, because what it does deliver is warm, cute, and full of heart.

If you're after a perfect chick-flick with a lot of heart, this is your match. The daughter-mother dynamics, the romance, the grief, the scenic backdrops - it comes together into something that's far from perfect, but deeply enjoyable. Sure, it could've been deeper, but sometimes you just want to be moved, to smile, to sniffle, to leave the cinema feeling something. And that's exactly what I got.",figurative
"Adventure After Adventure! ""One battle after another!"" perfectly describes this film - an action-packed journey that dives deep into the dark side of politics and police brutality. Many people prefer not to believe that corruption and unethical practices can exist within political systems, especially when certain groups hold ideologies different from the mainstream. The movie dares to touch on these uncomfortable truths, showing how authority and narrow-mindedness can lead to cruelty and injustice.

Sean Penn delivers a powerful performance - no surprise there. He captures the essence of the colonel's cold and cruel personality with incredible depth and conviction. His acting elevates the story and keeps the tension alive.

As for Leonardo, his brief scenes with his daughter were some of the most touching moments. I genuinely wanted to see more of that relationship and how he, as a single father, balances love and responsibility amid chaos. Those moments gave his character a human side that contrasted beautifully with the film's intense pace.

The movie itself is funny, thrilling, and filled with nonstop adventure. The soundtrack adds a playful twist to the action scenes, making the battles feel both intense and ironic. Leonardo's portrayal of a paranoid man - once a revolutionary now tangled in his own creation - was fascinating and full of irony.

It's not the movie of the year, but it's definitely worth watching. Entertaining, sharp, and full of energy - I enjoyed every moment.",figurative
"Doesn't know what it wants to be Sinners was a flick I was excited to see, mostly due to it being recommended by many (both off and online) and due to the high ratings it's been getting. However, I'm sad to say it didn't live up to my expectations.

The film has a terrific bunch of characters, better than 'From Dusk Till Dawn', the only film I can somewhat compare it to. The first half of the movie is mostly a ""get the team together"" part, much in the vein of ""Blues Brothers"" or heck, ""Ocean's Eleven"". Part of the problem is that, while the film has strong character building in this first half, not a lot actually happens. I was preconditioned with the knowledge that it had been called a spin on 'From Dusk Till Dawn', so when it is laid out that Smoke and Stack (both portrayed by Michael B. Jordan, who does a good job) are organizing a 'juke joint' at some barn, it was obvious this would be the 'horror' part of the film. So the main plot point of the first hour or so is just that; there's going to be a party later.

When the party actually starts, it has the most interesting/creative scene of the film; in which 'Preacherboy' (Miles Caton) performs his delta blues song, and the scene is juxtaposed with musicians from others times/regions. I was hoping the film would do more with that theme, but alas, it's just that one scene. Speaking of which, there's a lot of music in the film, and while I like blues music, it sometimes held up the pace of events. There's ways to incorporate music in films which enhances events in the film, but here the musical acts were too front and center in my opinion.

Shortly after that, we get to the ""characters making dumb decisions"" part, which seems to plague a lot of horror films. The Smokestack brothers seem to figure out that organizing juke joints for poor cotton farmers in the local area isn't very lucrative (who would've guessed?) and thus one of the brothers sends his love interest (Mary, played by Hailee Steinfeld) to get three 'white folk' who had been turned away previously due to being creepy (and white, which one of the brothers point out can be recipe for disaster in 1930's Jim Crowe's America). Why? Are these three people going to turn the night profitable? At that point Mary gets turned into a vampire and pretty soon all hell breaks loose. Stack gets bitten by her, the party stops, everyone leaves, everyone gets turned into vampires and we got our classic Assault on Precinct 13 scenario, in which a small group of hero's battle it out against evil.

A lot of dumb decisions are made during the buildup to the final battle, in which one of the dumb characters decides to invite all the vampires in about 30 minutes before the sun comes up. The battle itself is choreographed decently, but a lot of plot armor is dished around, a lot of cliché's play out (another love interest who foreshadowed that, if she gets bitten, Stack should finish her off before she turns, which plays out inevitably as planned). Preacherboy tries to escape, gets caught by the main vampire who proceeds to talk to him for 15 minutes with his fangs out, then gets bashed in the head while the suns gets up. Bleh.

Then we get a scene in which Stack (who also survived) shoots up some KKK members, because why not. At least in 'Django', shooting up the Klan felt earned. Here it seemed just another box to tick off.

Now I've only described the film on its surface elements. There's obviously a lot of subtext in terms of the vampires, who seem to share each other's memories and the main vampire who seems focussed on getting Preacherboy (who seems to be a brilliant Blues musician). So I suppose one could argue that Preacherboy is an metaphor for 'black music/culture', and the vampires are perhaps greed/capitalism, who want to suck the lifeblood out of the culture and homogenize it and turn it in an instrument for its own purpose? I'd have to think on that some more. The main vampire seems to be Irish and is hunted earlier in the film by native Americans who get turned away by some KKK members. Probably a lot more subtext that I missed.

But in short; the film tries to bite off more than it can chew, doesn't really know what it wants to do, and thus felt unsatisfying on about every front. It's well produced in terms of cinematography, costumes/production design and has some good characters, but that's about all the praise I can give it. It's also too long, I feel it could've shaved of at least 20 minutes. It wasn't terribly bad, but I wasn't entertained either.

Nice virtual vacation with Mike White's particular comedic genius. I am giving this eight stars as this is another Mike White series and they take a while to build. Enlightened definitely got better as it went along. Jake Lacy and wife Alexandra Daddario are a great pairing at being a bad romantic pairing. Nice to see the great Steve Zahn back in something as well. Jennifer Coolidge is hitting another high water mark as a clearly disturbed woman. Love the setting and music as well. Great summer series. Love i!,figurative
"Please, everyone, if you can, go see this in theaters. Frankenstein is probably my favorite book and one of my favorite pieces of media ever made, and holy cow did this not disappoint in the slightest. It's genuinely one of the best movies of the decade so far. I can't even begin to say how much I loved this, like, really good. The cinematography was absolutely insane, like genuinely amazing stuff. The shot I have as the banner is probably my favorite shot of the year so far. The score was sooo good-amazing stuff there. The costume design was so incredible, like actually insane work there. The production design, though, that stole the show for me, was actually insane. No way in hell it doesn't win that Oscar. That's really all I can say about this for now. I got to see it in 35mm, which was amazing. Please go see this movie.",literal
"Could have been great Mae should probably stick to writing and comedy, where they really shine. I felt Mae's acting let it down along with the ending. Blown away with Toni and the children's acting, the premise and the writing up to the last few episodes and then was left totally deflated by the last few eps. With a different lead actor and a few tweaks and fleshed out storytelling this could have been a 9 or 10/10! Still enjoyed and worth a watch.",figurative
"Amazing! I love it. Haven't watched such a good show since Supernatural. Tracker is one of the best new shows I've watched in a long time. Justin Hartley brings depth and charisma to the role of Colter Shaw, a unique character who's part detective, part survivalist. Each episode presents a new mystery, but it's the emotional undercurrent-his complex past and moral compass-that really sets the show apart.

The writing is sharp, the pacing is solid, and the visuals give it a more cinematic feel than most procedurals. I also appreciate that the cases are interesting on their own, while still tying into a larger story.

Overall, Tracker feels fresh, well-acted, and surprisingly moving. Highly recommend to anyone who enjoys mystery, action, or character-driven dramas.""",literal
"Went downhill after season 13! The show was fun to watch between seasons 1-13. The cast was kept untouched (apart from the great addition of Palmer). Ziva was also a great replacement for Caitlin after season 2, and Bishop also did ok replacing Ziva. The show kept a constant 8/10 rating between the first 13 seasons. Now I'm half way through season 14 and I can't continue watching it. The replacement cast simply didn't cut it for me. Also, Ducky's appearance has drastically reduced in season 14 (so far).

Once Anthony DiNozzo left at the end of season 13, they tried replacing him with Quinn and Torres. Unfortunately, they've dulled the show down heavily. If it wasn't for Gibbs, the show would've come to an end after season 13.

My ratings would be: 8/10 for seasons 1-13 5/10 for season 14 (can't continue watching any further, bored of it now) Overall rating 7/10

If I continued watching it, my overall review would probably drop down to 6/10.",literal
"Klaus Schwab the Movie You will own nothing and you will be happy! I think Keanu was suckered in this movie. It came out much different than what he probably thought it was.

"A heartwarming-magical voyage of oceanic proportions! I've seen it eight times already! I just can't stop riding in the canoe along lovable Maui and Moana! Looking forward to watching it nth times! Can't help myself. It's like entering my personal holographic suite: a 1.5 hours Paradise-oceanic-adventure with such charismatic characters in an engaging and thoughtful story. Absolutely beautiful and enchanting. 

The Wonderful:

It's gorgeous in all possible ways – character design, environments, storytelling, etc. I giggle, I laugh, I cry, I sob, I feel the ocean spray! I touch the water! So vivid! Sometimes the animation reminds me of Hannah Barbera afternoon cartoons (Jabberjaw, etc.), just love it!

From the beginning, we know that Moana is qualified to undertake such a mission – to save her island and her people. Along the story, we see how she behaves and reacts to situations—hints that she will be able to overcome future adversities. I loved how toddler Moana gives up a treasure to protect the innocent: so young and already showing how big her heart is. 

I loved the storytelling embedded in Maui's body tattoos. Amazing! Cute. Maui is a rough funny guy, but he is easily lovable, once we learn what's in his heart and mind. Maui seems scary at first, but he shows us how charming he is with his song. Right then I know I'm going to totally love him! I also thought Maui was a perfect blend of Hulk, Hercules, Lou Ferrigno all hybridized into Dwayne Johnson's caricature, voice and performance (I love how Maui's smile/eyes mirror D. Johnson's eyes/smile) Brilliant! 

The emotional content and the empowering message weaved throughout the story is very strong. Moana fulfills her mission and any self-doubt is extricated. She discovers who she really is and realizes her full potential. As for Maui, he re-discovers his human heart! At first I thought the crab scene was too long, but then I realized it was necessary for Maui's hardship (which would later becomes gratitude).

Loved the songs—(I sing along in the late showings if I'm alone in the auditorium!) The lyrics move the story forward and give us insight into the character's hearts and minds. Clever! 

And with all the humor splashing about I giggled lots too. Little children just love the scenes with the pig and the rooster!

The scenes with the fleet of boats and canoes give me goosebumps and chills! It's so magical! I just want to be there myself! So many spectacular sweeping ocean vistas. Wow! Also, the workings of light and shadow, the water kinetics, the night scenes, etc. Absolutely brilliant and genius!

The voice performance is perfectly harmonized: Dwayne Johnson makes a brilliant and authentic Maui. Cravahlo infuses true life into sixteen-year-old Moana, making her full of spirit. Amazing animation! Moana's and Maui's gestures and emotional expressions are sublime, Grandma's are fantastic too!

Moana's story and animation pulses with real life. I read that the Disney-animation team visited the Pacific Islands and did lots of character exploration. (more details in www.variety.com and Moana's interview in www.insidethemagic.net).

The think-about-it: 

At first, Maui is ogre-ish, tossing Moana into the water (was this roughness really necessary?, not my favorite). But when he realizes that Moana is not alone (she has the Ocean protecting her), and that she is a highly determined, kind, and brave teenager; he learns to respect her and admire her. The climatic point of his change of heart is when Moana saves his lifeyou'll see!

Moana's desire to help her people and revive her island makes her strong and resilient, so she learns how to journey along Maui and steers him to become a good human. And precisely this adversity she faces (with a little help of the good forces that accompany her) allows her to discover who she really is/who she is meant to be. So inspiring!

Conclusion?

Never give up your dream, no matter how ""ogreish"" your adversity is! Please watch it! It's a paradise worth sailing into nth-times! It's entertaining, stunningly beautiful, emotional, and it'll warm your heart with hope and satisfaction.",figurative
"So far, not impressed I will admit to start off that ""IT"" has never been my favorite Stephen King novel, and have found some of his others to be so much scarier. However, I did enjoy both Tim Curry's and Bill Skarsgard's renditions of Pennywise at least. This series so far, three episodes in, is pretty dull and tedious. I'm enjoying the characters of the military men but find all of the kids to be tedious and the plot very slow. There is a graveyard scene that is like something straight out of Goosebumps. What is missing are the scares. No scares. I'm disappointed and haven't enjoyed a horror series since Midnight Mass. Come on. Make another series the quality of The Haunting of Hill House or The Grudge. I'm begging you.",figurative
"I can still respect the effort behind it Even though it didn't impress me that much, I can still respect the effort behind it.

Solid attempt, but it just didn't click with me the way I expected, even though the concept had real potential.",literal
Fun to watch You need to go into this movie with a open mind. The acting is terrible and the action is over the top. Arnold has a cheesy line every time he kills a bad guy. But the underlying plot is what makes it interesting. The government using tv and the entertainment industry to distract the public from their corruption. The mix of the classic 80's action movie cheese with a story line of a totalitarianism and industry corruption makes it fun to watch. Your either going to love it or hate it but if you get it you will enjoy it.,literal
"Not Who, Not What, but Why? With such an iconic 1966 animated 1/2 hour special, it's hard to imagine a reason to reimagine it as a live action movie. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. I'm not particularly angry or hate this. It's just that I couldn't stop asking Why? 

This one gives a backstory to the origin of the Grinch. He gets delivered by mistake to Whoville. The kids bully him because of his looks. In frustration, he runs away to live on the mountain. Now he is a fully grown loner. Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen) is searching for the meaning of Christmas. She tries to see the good in the Grinch, and keeps trying to bring the spirit of Christmas to him. But the Grinch just can't get into the spirit.

I don't have a big problem with the additional backstory or the greater role for Cindy Lou Who. That's to be expected for an expanded Grinch. And Taylor Momsen is a perfectly good child actor. But none of it excites me. The visual design is again expected but without the outlandishness of 'The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T.' for instance. However it is still great once we get to the last part where the Grinch tries to steal Christmas. All the sentiments are there voiced especially by Cindy Lou Who's father. That part still works. Nothing can change that.",literal
"Cow punching scenery and psychopathy It's a lot like a western. Since it's all set on the old homestead it's kind of like Bonanza, The Virginian, the Big Valley or The Big Country rather than the John Wayne, James Stewart, Randolph Scott style, man on his own oater. There's a bit of a difference in that the Cartwrights, whoever was running Shiloh ranch at any particular time, Barbara Stanwyck, and even Charlton Heston didn't go around murdering people for no more reason than that they were inconvenient.

In the good old days you had good guys and bad guys. But things are more nuanced now. So you can admire John Dutton's love of the land, his devotion to his family, or, at least, what he sees as his dynasty, his cod wisdom, and more or less give him a pass on being a serial killer.

So. So far so good. Up to the end of series 2. I'm mid way through series 4 right now and it's like a repeat, of the first two series but with a different set of adversaries.

However, there is a problem.

I'm guessing that Costner's obvious devotion to all things cowboy is part of it. But I can't help wondering whether sponsorship might also be a factor in the way that I am now constantly having to watch (actual) rodeo riders displaying their skills in long scenes that have nothing to do with the plot. I like Netflix because, so far, it's ad free, but really , scenes of riders stopping their horses (why is that even a skill) or making them pirouette, make me want to go and get a cup of tea. Jimmy's journey to cowboy land is also looking a bit like a documentary now that he's signed up with a real life Texas ranch. In between that though the story is still engrossing enough to keep me going.",figurative
"Instant Classic One of the best shows I've ever seen. For people calling it ""slow"" you are probably used to the spoon fed, big corporation sludge thats being pumped out on a conveyer belt. Everything from cinematography, character growth, scriptwriting, music, plot, and acting is downright top notch. We should applaud creativity in our time when it comes to art. This show is one of those moments. Some of the acting as well in this show is some of the best I have seen in any series.

I also think the concept of what makes a human a true human is very intriguing. I am a christian myself but find this show exploring the nature of humanity and consciousness very telling for how our culture is seeking these existential ideas.",literal
"Interesting but more The plot will certainly keep one engaged, there's some fairly high quality acting, and writing that reflects and unusual familiarity with the topics involved.

It's very much binge material. You might end up staying up too late watching this. It's not typical TV thriller stuff in that regard, it's quite addictive. And beyond that? It has some themes which for the right person, will speak loudly, perhaps stir something. Quite uncommon in TV. Hence the high rating - it's both very entertaining, and has something to say.",literal
"Feels Like We Never Left For someone that has nostalgia for the 2000s Freaky Friday, this was everything I wanted it to be. I was worried at first because this was supposed to be a straight to Disney+ movie. So I did not know what to expect. But I'm pleased to say this legacy sequel keeps everything great about that movie while still having its own heart felt moments to it. Lindsay Lohan, and Jamie Lee Curtis are back! And are as great as ever. Even after all these years they are still able to make these characters work. They are both two different characters, and they both absolutely sell it on both of them and make you believe that they are actually two different characters. It's just the right comedic timing and acting. It's so believable. And even the new cast of kids they have in here, same thing goes for them. They do actually feel like the older cast of characters. And thats whats so fun about playing a role like this, you're able to change your personality up and be over the top and make it work. It's crazy that even 20 years later, not only the actors, but the script, the story, all still works and feels like it's only been a few years after the original film. The comedy is still as funny as always, the story is still that classic freaky Friday story, but with more heart. Yes, we still keep that classic formula. But this time since there's four characters being swapped around, and kids trying to change up their parents marriage. It adds for this whole new layer of satisfaction near the end. The character arcs had a meaning and they went through something because you cared for the characters. It had more meaning because of that extra layer you decided to put on. It is not just a mother daughter banter, this time it's the whole family banter and that's why it works better. Now, this is not better than the original film. No one was expecting it to be. But it is still very much on the same par as the original film because it still keeps everything great about the original film, just 20 years later. But of course, the movie is still predictable, we've seen this formula before you seen this type of movie before you know how it's gonna end. But the journey to get there and that heartfelt ending is what makes it worth watching. If you have nostalgia for that original film or just love the freaky Friday movies this is your thing, but if you did not grow up on that, don't know what this is. Don't check this out. It's probably not for you.",figurative
"First episode and I already love it I saw this anime online once and I finally took the time to watch it. Needless to say, the first few episodes are none less than EXCELLENT! It's action packed, funny, has just the right amount of hot people for the classic anime needs. As soon as I watched the first episode I found myself watching all of them and telling all my friends to watch it; it's so amazing, something to be put to the top, next to Death Note or Fullmetal Alchemist, or Dragon Ball Z. Definitely my favorite anime currently. There's not that much to say except that it's definitely a comedy, you'll definitely laugh or have a good chuckle. It is very gory however, not that suitable for younger anime fans.

"Wow , well done Netflix and Tim Burton's! I loved this series. Jenna Ortega as Wednesday Addams was truly a match made in heaven. Pairing her alongside the character of Enid was a fantastic choice by the directors considering how their scenes together really stole the show. We got to dive into the backstory of the Addams family a little bit which I LOVED. Morticia and Gomez were amazing and I loved their characterization. Don't even get me started on Pugsley. He was such a sweet boy and an excellent (and refreshing) take on the character. Enid Sinclair surprised me with how much I grew to love her. Jenna and Emma's characters were an absolute blast to watch on screen. I wasn't too interested in the love triangle. It was strenuous and bland and left me feeling bad for Wednesday. However, I can definitely seen potential in Wednesday and Enid becoming something more. Their chemistry had me laughing and crying (especially at the end). Overall, this was an amazing show. It exceeded all of my expectations. My only hope is that for future seasons (please Netflix give me more) for the CGI to be more fleshed out.

Season 2 went downhill. 4/10. It feels to me like they were stringing fans along. Main problem is that there's not really much going on. The majority of screen time consists of angry conversions about the same issues between characters who swear every other word. It got very repetitive and boring.

I also felt like the Iris subplot was disconnected, illogical, and aimless.

"An extravagant B-movie from France with all the right matinee-adventure ingredients. This is a grandiose monster movie from France that delivers the perfect blend of slick style and unsophisticated, gothic melodrama to make it one of the most appealing film fantasies in a long while.  The international success of the film is not hard to understand; it's exhilarating in the same way that the old Hammer horror films were in their heyday.  Everything about this elaborate movie is terrifically tacky, particularly the stunning production design.  It's like seeing those artless, wilderness paintings containing hidden animal images come to life.  The characters come off as if they were lifted right off of some garish paperback romance-novel cover. Best of all, the film has some nifty  flourishes of sex and violence sadly missing from the current spate of half-baked, PG-13 Hollywood product. While some seem to be complaining of one martial-arts fight too many, faulty creature effects or simple-minded plotting; in this case, it's like bitching about KING KONG being over the top.  This is a contemporary B-movie (albeit an expensive, subtitled one) for those who appreciate a good time at the movies.  It delivers the kind of satisfaction audiences used to get seeing the work of Mario Bava or Ray Harryhausen; and that's saying a lot!",literal
"Great sincere and investing drama Roofman is a highly investing drama that mostly acts as a sincere character piece with a looming sense of doom because you know it's all going to go wrong at some point. The tonal shifts are seriously impressive as the film mostly moves between comedy and earnest emotion with a sharper tonal shift towards the end which feels intentionally jarring. Plus there's real nostalgia in seeing a Toys R Us again.

Channing Tatum gives one of his best performances to date whilst offering a welcome reminder of just how good his leading man talents can be. He's instantly empathetic and sustains the first act on his charisma alone. He only gets better once he starts sharing scenes with Kirsten Dunst who gives an equally heartfelt performance so the relationship that quickly develops between them feels genuine.

Director Derek Cianfrance is handling lighter material when compared to his previous efforts and he does it gracefully, moving through a whole film's worth of plot early on to get to the more interesting story without rushing. Andrij Parekh's cinematography switches between being extremely calm and frenetic when required, complimented by a rich texture in the image thanks to the decision to shoot on film.",literal

"Great thriller! The Beast in Me,"" the psychological thriller miniseries from Netflix, stands out primarily due to the caliber of its main cast's performances. Claire Danes and Matthew Rhys deliver remarkable acting, which serves as the backbone of a tense and intricately constructed narrative.

The series masterfully operates within the thriller genre, engaging the viewer on an almost investigative level. The plot is skillfully woven with subtle clues and calculated developments, encouraging the audience to piece together the puzzle of the truth alongside the characters. This narrative device creates an immersive experience, transforming passive consumption into an exercise in deduction and anticipation-a highlight of the production.

Central to the series' tension is the arc of Aggie Wiggs, portrayed by Danes. Her choices, at times questionable and self-destructive, are the raw representation of a psyche shaken by grief and guilt. The character navigates a ""deep limbo"" emotionally, where the pain of trauma distorts her perception of reality. The character's strength lies in her flawed humanity: despite her obscured perception, she follows her intuition, which makes her complex and undeniably realistic.

The narrative structure is largely solid, with the caveat that some minor insights into the fate of secondary characters could have been explored with a little more detail. However, these are fine-tuning points that do not diminish the strength of the overall work.

In summary, ""The Beast in Me"" is a robust example of the genre, anchored by masterful performances and a captivating thriller structure. The series achieves a level of excellence that justifies a high evaluation, close to perfection.",figurative
"Unexpected gem in the world of modern spy dramas /refers to Seasons 1-4/

This Series offers a gritty, darkly humorous, and refreshingly offbeat take on the espionage genre. Centred around Slough House-a dumping ground for disgraced MI5 operatives-the series thrives on its sharp writing, layered characters, and standout performances, particularly from Gary Oldman as the gloriously grotesque Jackson Lamb. Oldman brings the character to life with a perfect blend of abrasive wit and unexpected depth, earning near-universal praise for what many call one of his most iconic roles.

Across its four seasons, the Series steadily builds momentum. Perhaps the first two seasons are a bit slow to start, they're filled with intrigue and character development. Seasons 3 and 4, however, crank up the intensity, weaving intricate plots and thrilling twists without falling into the trap of filler episodes-a rarity in today's streaming world.

Jack Lowden as River Cartwright provides a grounded counterpoint to Oldman's chaos, while the ensemble cast-Aimee-Ffion Edwards, Kristin Scott Thomas, Rosalind Eleazar, and others-adds emotional weight and diversity to the series. Guest stars like Sope Dirisu and Hugo Weaving only elevate the show's quality further.

The Series is able to mix suspense with clever humour, never taking itself too seriously while still delivering emotional and political punch. The dynamics between generations-Boomers and Millennials navigating high-stakes intelligence work-add an unexpected layer of social commentary.

Despite minor quibbles, like underdeveloped new characters or repetitive soundtrack choices, Slow Horses remains consistently entertaining. With tight, six-episode seasons and a rich, ever-evolving plot, it's a perfect binge-and definitely one of the best spy shows in years. Whether you're in it for the conspiracies, the character drama, or just to watch Oldman be delightfully gross, Slow Horses is absolutely worth the watch. Next seasons can't come soon enough.",figurative
"A Cozy, Flawed NYC Romance I went into Materialists (2025) expecting a forgettable rom-com, but wow, it surprised me, earning a 6.5/10!

Dakota Johnson's Lucy, a New York matchmaker, juggles a hotshot client, Harry (Pedro Pascal), and her ex, John (Chris Evans), in a story that's funny, heartfelt, and a bit predictable. It's all about love versus money, and I felt that tug in my chest. Johnson's warm but could've popped more; Pascal had me swooning with his charm, and Evans made me ache for his quiet guy.

Celine Song's direction and Shabier Kirchner's dreamy 35mm NYC visuals are a treat, though the story drags in spots and wraps up too neatly. I laughed, I teared up a bit, and I didn't expect to care as much as I did. It's perfect for a cozy night with your phone nearby for the slower bits.

Materialists isn't perfect, but it's got heart and beat my low expectations!",literal
"Love Historical Fiction I Love a good Historical Fiction show with a great soundtrack . Add in accents , alcohol , greed, sex and raunchy politics and don't forget scandals . Who knew Fenians was a name used before the IRA. Love the Irish countryside, too. A Perfect series for me and my husband. Hopefully they will renew for season 2.",literal
"Demographically unrealistic Seattle is only 6.8% black but every episode has a black patient or patients...in reality they'd hardly see one at all.

Meredith Grey is the most annoying, hard to please woman in the history of TV...she looked 50 back when she was supposed to be a young intern

The only likable female in the entire show was Lexie...so she had to go

So much humping happens in store rooms that you could create new humans from all the DNA that must be on the walls

In the plane crash none of them had the common sense to keep a fire burning, or build the fire nearer to Lexie and Mark, are these really the brilliant, geniuses that we're constantly told they are.",figurative
"Obsessed I LOVE THIS SHOW.

It's different than all the same police dramas out there. I love the sleepy town vibe, not every cop show needs to be in the big city, as true crime happens literally everywhere. I really hope they do a second season and not kill it off like they do all the other good shows.

I love that it has a little romance and not completely covered in sex.

Loving Sutherland.... Keifer who?

Also, love the whole police staff.

I do miss the days when seasons have more than 8-10 episodes. I definitely would have devoured more episodes of season 1.

I've got the last episode to go and I hope it's fantastic!!",figurative
"Solid 8/10 I binge-watched it yesterday, and honestly, it was wonderful. The cast is excellent-every actor feels perfectly chosen for their role-and the overall aesthetic is stunning. The fight choreography, in particular, is on another level: precise, elegant, and genuinely thrilling to watch.

I don't enjoy action movies or series as much as I used to, unless they offer truly exceptional fight scenes. This one didn't just meet that requirement-it far exceeded my expectations.

There are a few negatives, but none of them have to do with the series itself. The only downside is Netflix's business model.

Now I have to wait over a year for the next season, if-and hopefully-the financial metrics align with what the CEO wants.

That uncertainty is frustrating, especially when a show is this good..",literal
"MGM+ stamp on-screen The series was very intriguing but the permanent white ""MGM+"" stamp in the lower right corner of the screen was so distracting that I could not enjoy the movie.

I appreciate this iteration of a cinematic classic but MGM+ needs to remove that awful tag in the lower corner.

Advertising is one thing but distraction is another.",literal
"Stupidly accurate The office in a medical center, what do you need more. As a doctor, a lot of these interactions and jokes are very recognisable from the daily work.

A good show to relax after a long day, well filmed, good actors. Interested to see where they will be taking the characters and the storyline.

Yes, the characters are gross generalisations from each discipline but there is some truth in it which makes it more funny.

Lighten up all healthcare workers who are leaving bad reviews, this doesn't put us in a bad light. Relax and laugh with yourself and your (sometimes annoying) collegues, it's just a joke!",literal
"A great film true to it origins! I have been reading and owning the Fantastic Four paper comics since 1973 (when it came to Norway for the first time with norwegian translation) and up to the last one in 1987 (altogether 43 magazines/comics editions). This new film reminded me much of original happenings from these magazines. A very good adaption.

I will not give away much more, so I will reccommend you to go and see the film for yourself!

Some changes could still be seen here as in the original Fantastic Four cartoon from the 1960s in the USA (1970s in Norway), the Silver Surfer was portrayed as male, consistent with his comic book identity as Norrin Radd, the herald of Galactus.

However, in the 2025 reboot film ""The Fantastic Four: First Steps"", the Silver Surfer is portrayed as female, specifically the character Shalla-Bal, played by Julia Garner. This version is set in an alternate universe and represents a creative departure from the traditional depiction.

Galactus was first introduced to Norwegian readers in the comic series ""Et Fantastiske Fire Eventyr"" in 1973, specifically in issue #2, titled ""Galactus kommer"" (""Galactus is coming"").

This issue featured the classic Galactus saga originally created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, which also introduced the Silver Surfer. It was part of the early wave of Marvel comics translated and published in Norway during the 1970s.

Looking forward for future episodes of F4 (if they come ;-) )",literal
"Really great At first, I thought this would be a horror movie since it's based on a Stephen King book. But what I found was something different-a movie about human values like loyalty, revenge, and survival.

The characters are well written, and the dialogues feel real and powerful. The dystopian setting in the U. S. is intense, and you can really feel the tough atmosphere. The soldiers show no mercy when killing the participants, which makes the story even harder to watch but also more gripping.

It's not the horror I expected, but it's a strong and intense film. You should definitely give it a try.",literal
"More a soap than a historical period drama It started off so promising. Lovely camera work, nice acting, but then .... The writing and directing started falling apart rapidly. Scenes started to look very over the top, the story telling very predictable, sometimes boring and sometimes even hilarious and very inconsistent. Some scenes look as if they were part of a rather bad commercial with actors looking bewildered (or like a deer in the head lights)with agonizing violins playing in the background. It's like watching a soap, but without any sense of humour. The characters are depicted so over the top, that it resembles a Disney production for kids. The bad guy is Scrooge or Cruella all over again, almost laughable. The good guy seems to have come from Homeland and plays a bi-polar role. One scene he is a social, loving and caring husband, the next scene he is a egotistical self indulging hypocrite galloping through the series on his horse. It's not the acting. Actually it is in a weird way kind of fun how the actors play these almost ridiculous and often impossible roles. Quite good in fact. A bit like a soap or a satire. So I feel a bit cheated. I wanted it to be more a historical time piece, more subtle, more realistic, less over the top. Then again, this is probably how modern entertainment is brought to us nowadays.",literal
"Only now and and then It is the case that we have to wait for every few years to pass before a true masterpiece comes our way, as was the case with Breaking Bad, the first few seasons of the Walking Dead and then, at last but not least, Animal Kingdom. I was gripped from the off, I loved the plot twists, the nod to break point, well in my mind anyway, the casting of the brothers and of course the nephew, all near perfect although I did miss the presence of Baz and Smurf in the later episodes. To the writers, cast and crew and all else involved, thank you for keeping me entertained of which was a truly stand out show.",figurative
"The good, the bad, the indifferent I've been watching L&O, all seasons over the last several months, and have several opinions about the series:

Lennie Briscoe was, for most of the run of the show, the heart of it. Well, gee, everyone knew that, didn't they? Of course, but even the obvious should be restated from time to time. Jerry Orbach was much more well known for his stage work, especially in musicals (he got his start in The Fantastiks, ca. 1960) than his often overlooked film roles, but once he became Lenny, it changed his entire life. He went from an occasional supporting role to a really fine character lead. It's too bad that his health failed him just as he had the resume and acting chops to become even better known.

Second in line: Jesse Martin. Another stage musician (original cast of Rent) who grew from the ""junior"" detective to senior investigator, and did a fine job as both.

Of the lawyers, I'm a big fan of Jill Hennessy; it's too bad she only lasted four seasons until she got her own show (Crossing Jordan) but she showed both intensity and humor in her role. Angie Harmon I never really cared for; her character was just TOO intense for my taste. The other ADAs were okay; I preferred De La Gorza to E. Rohm, the rest were pretty equal to each other.

Waterson beat both Moriarty and Roche, that is until he took over the DA role, when McCoy became so intense that the character lost me. The other DAs were okay; my favorite was Diane Wiest, with Senator Thompson better than Steven Hill (odd, since he was not a trained actor.)

Chris Noth, I thought, was better than Bratt, who was better than Farina, who was better than Jeremy Sisto, who was in turn better than Anthony Anderson. Merkerson beat out Dan Florek, that is until her last season; the cancer thing was a distraction.

I must mention several of the ""day players,"" especially Leslie Hendrix, John Cariani, J.K. Simmons, and, my ""crush"", Megan Byrne. All of them were real bright spots whenever they appeared.

I can't let Fran Liebowitz's Judge Goldberg go by without crediting her (another non-actor) for some fine comedy bits. Not bad, for three or four lines per appearance.

The entire series really took off when ""Lenny"" joined the cast, and started lessening in quality when Orbach left. The first two seasons were seemingly rehearsals for the main part; the last two were almost throw-a-ways. Overall, it's still my favorite series of all time.",literal
"Impossible plot! Horrible acting! Impossible plot! there's less than zero chemistry between Hudson and Wyman. Wyman's acting is wooden and uninspired. At the time, Hudson was under scrutiny for being in the closet gay. He needed this film to save his career.",literal
Solid but weak last episodes This is a solid true crime show with brilliant acting. Especially Evan Peters does an awesome job. It's exciting to see the horrible story of JD staged so carefully. Would have been an 8 but the last two episodes focus too much on JDs neighbour Glenda Cleveland. She surely suffered a lot when JDs crimes were discovered but 15 people had been killed whose friends and families certainly suffered a lot more. I think those people deserve more attention than a lady that indeed did a good job but was not involved in the matter so much. That's why the last episodes are a little bit slow moving. All in all worth a watch.,literal
"Captivating and brilliant true story Like so many, I knew next to nothing about the 20th President James Garfield but a great series (like a great book, which this is adapted from) makes you want to delve deeper into finding out more about what you just saw.

What helps the narrative here though is the incredible acting which there is no shortage of. I've always been a huge fan of Michael Shannon and he doesn't disappoint here as President Garfield.

If you love history, are a sponge to it, add to that an amazing cast of actors then you're in for a treat and you won't be disappointed.",literal
"Took a down turn Season 1 was absolutely terrific. However, something went horribly wrong in season 2. Not sure if they had some different writers or what. The story line sucked. The way it was filmed looked cheesy and completely different. Even the music used in season 2 was bad. I gave season 1 a rating of 9. Season 2 probably a 5.... And that's ONLY b/c of the cast! I would have stopped watching under normal circumstances.",literal
"Senseless stupidity not funny What a disappointment of a great cast. One is supposed to be funny (Kevin James) and the other a superhuman (Alan Ritchson). The script is so bad that it is not funny at all. Plot is so terrible and the characters just meander meaninglessly. Car chase is out of place and the ending is idiotic. Save your time, watch something else. All the positive reviews are likely from the production team itself.",literal
"Another unnecessary remake The decision to change how the game is played, and how the players are recruited was a nice touch. That's the only good thing about this movie. None of the action scenes are memorable, and this is partly due to the fact that there are few of those in this extremely long snooze fest. The theater was silent with anticipation of the end arriving, holding on to a small chance that something spectacular would happen eventually. Josh Brolin somehow looked like he was morphing into Gary Busey. I believe it was those strange looking teeth. Glenn looked constipated during the entire film. Cera was the only one who appeared to be having fun. This movie sucked.",literal
"Just another terrible NCIS spinoff Coming on the tails of the lousy spinoffs of Sydney and Hawaii, this spinoff is heading in the same direction. I did not find much to like about show. Actors did not seem to have much chemistry together. Storyline from the first two episodes were weak at best. Can't really cant see this getting past a couple seasons, just too boring and painful to watch. I am not sure who thought this prequel would be a good decision. The stories will get old pretty quick as you can only hash back the story of Leroy Jethro Gibbs so much before it gets repetitive. I think they will end up with non consistent storyline that will just leave viewers scratching their heads in disappointment.",literal
"Awesome One of the best kids' movies ... my daughter loves watching this every time.

Also this movie has beautiful collection of songs that anyone can enjoy.",literal
"Who greenlighted this mess? Nine writers put together a ten-episode parade of actors trying to figure out who their characters are. They're all at odds with each other. Kristen Wiig shrieks her way throughout, which is understandable given her puzzling choice of insufferable friends. Carol Burnett uses facial expressions that are very familiar to those who know her work, which adds humor to a flat scene. If I weren't stressed out, bored, confused or frustrated at all the padding (a whale?), and the cringey dialogue, I might enjoy the show. The snappy preview promised a faster pace and lots of fun situations. Just to fill in the 10-hour time allotment, they lightly touched on random social issues that don't move the plot forward. But is there a plot? Was that ever discussed among the writers? Do the writers even know each other? I watch because I like the actors. I'm just sorry they were given such poor material. I hope they were paid well.",literal
So bad Genuinely terrible. The rest of the cast made me want to overlook Kim Kardashians horrible acting but it is truly unwatchable. I don't know how all these a list acctresses lowered their standards to star in this but it is so bad. The soundtrack is also so so bad like a couple good songs but overall such a weird vibe. Ryan Murphy I am so disappointed! I really wanted to like it.,literal
"Finally a real excellent movie that will make History ! Besides the description and the breathtaking incarnation of huge characters by the actors; besides a perfect and clear script; besides the reconstitution of the trial, the movie offers many layers of interpretation and real food for questions about how it was possible and how it is still possible nowadays for human beings to commit such atrocities. The Nuremberg trial did not stop them by showing the world the depth of horrors.",literal
"Pleasantly surprised I came into this with mid expectations. I had watched HPI (wasn't a fan of the last season tbh) , and honestly the first few episodes were okay in comparison. But I've grown to like it! (I'm at episode 9)

Sometimes I used to get frustrated with the chaotic energy of Morgane in HPI- she was adorable at first but slowly becoming unlikeable. The Morgan in High Potential was a little too perfect at first but is slowly opening up and I like her. She's got her issues but she's not totally obnoxious and definitely a better mom.

The character I wish was better is Karadec. He misses that intensity the original series had as well as the palpable tension with Morgane.

I have a lot of hope for this series - who knows, it may actually live up to the hype of the original!",literal
"Exciting bringe Fresh rabbit hole. Unpredictable twists, excellent acting, enticing storyline. As soon as you think who's the good guy, who's the bad, the rug gets pulled out of your feet. Good balance between slow dialogues and fast paced action, between ups and down and in betweens. Excellent binge for a weekend. Season 2 please, soon!",literal
"Tremendous television Let me say one thing: if you had come to me a decade ago and said that Kevin Costner's flagging career would be revived thanks to his role in a modern day western, I would probably have laughed and called you crazy.

Yet it happened. Costner's John Dutton will surely go down in the annals of TV history as one of the best characters ever.

Costner played Dutton perfectly: a doting father, a ruthless ranch owner and a man who is no stranger to violence. Unforgettable.

With ""Yellowstone, Taylor Sheridan has done something quite difficult: he made us care immensely about a bunch of characters of dubious moral standing.

For example, Kelly Reilly's Beth Dutton was, for the most part, a horrible person, yet you cared about what happened for her, cheered on her successes and commiserated her failures, even when said successes might have been on the wrong side of what's right.

That's because Reilly is a brilliant actress, and because she was given top-notch material to work with.

Cole Hauser, Luke Grimes, Kelsey Asbille, Wes Bentley...all brilliant.

Sheridan is a genius.

What a show. We won't see it's like again, that's for sure.",literal
"Great concept, but main character is so annoying Like title says, the concept is great, however the main-character is always grumpy and does not seem to get to grasp with the situation. Not sure I can cope with another episode of her being negative and uncontrollable, its flat out annoying.

Big plus for the originality of it all, and how we as viewers do not fully understand what is going on.",literal
"Continues to be a time capsule of America The OG Law and Order is a show I watch religiously on Sundance, WE, and now BBC. Still upset it's not readily streaming all 20 season like SVU. With all of my love for L&O, I cannot watch anything until Lenny Briscoe arrives in Season 3 and then Jack McCoy and Lt. Van Buren in Season 4. The same social issues in the 90s are still what we experience in 2020. Definitely one of my all time favorites and will always will be.",figurative
"It kind of let itself down It had all the ingredients and all the elements of a good movie but it didn't quite come together to make an actual good movie. And the ending just felt lazy, like a placeholder that never got rewritten properly.

It seemed like it had a twist and some ambiguity and maybe it's this way but maybe she's doing that, maybe she's lying now maybe she was lying before, But it threw in so many obvious twists in how things were said and presented and from the performances and the edit and direction that the last second twist was obviously going to happen from like half way through so it wasn't even slightly surprising.

Then the closing montage was dumb and lazy after the lazy twist, so it was going for emotional impact but didn't produce any emotional weight whatsoever.

And the flashbacks and black and white scenes with a voiceover like a dream sequence were we supposed to believe the theme? The event? What was said by the people in the scene or what was shown or what was said in voiceover? Some seemed to be trying to show true events but made them not true by making them dumb and wrong and dream logic and they were just inconsistent and just sucked.

TLDR: Nearly good but managed not to be.",literal

"Phenomenal Show! Yellowstone has it all-a great cast, great acting, a great plot, great writing, several different storylines that each keep your interest, and complex characters that you actually either like or sympathize with. The best villains in any story are the ones you can connect with. Yellowstone has plenty of characters who walk the line between good and evil, but the general idea is that everyone is doing what it takes to fulfill their arcs, which takes good writing! There isn't too much of one note on this show and that's what makes it so enjoyable to watch (That and the beautiful Montana scenery in every episode). There's drama, suspense, sadness, love, humor, vengeance, violence, and family issues, all under an umbrella of a brilliant, and fresh modern Western.",literal

"Watching this may cause brain damage I cannot believe all high ratings here for this lemon. There should be new classification - N4MA (not for mature audience) created for such outrageously dumb movies.

And, some of the actors involved in this should be ashamed of themselves. Alan Ritchson, what is wrong with you? The only one fit for his role in this schlock is Kevin James.

Don't be fooled by high marks, it's probably the result of people watching whole movie and being affected by the sheer volume of brain damaging stupidity...",literal
"None-stop-fun The show is unique and actually fun to watch, Zach and Michael make an incredible team, their dark and odd ball humor shines through. A lot of hidden gems, especially if you are a fan of Oneyplays, a let's play channel, that sort of flows like a podcast, where Zach often appears with his friend Chris O'Neil, and a host of other real life smiling friends, some of which do voices in this series. Just a treat start to finish... Looking forward to more.",figurative
"Very exciting and super cool. Very worth watching I must say love this movie and wow the action scenes and fights scenes and backstory of the characters. Especially Jackie Chan's acting through this many decades its still nice and amazing. He gives the father figure in the movie and also Tony Leung wow both have father figures and also the pacing of the movie is good.

Also If you are a carat fan and also a huge fan of action movies, this movie is mind blowing especially seeing Wen Junhui and my first time seeing Zhang Zifeng the only girl in the movie can fight so well. Its so awesome and wow to see them on the big screen.

Looking forward to the sequel.",figurative
"Nowhere as good as the West End production I saw the West End production of Wicked a few years ago and I was really surprised how much enjoyed it so I was quite looking forward to this. Unfortunately it doesn't quite reach the heights of the Theatre production and in some parts it felt a little drawn out and even a tad boring. I did notice a number of younger viewers leaving before the end as it just didn't hold there attention, so maybe something to consider if you're thinking of taking under 8s.

The songs were ok, some better than others, and the voices of all singing were v good, well maybe apart from OZ himself, but we can forgive Jeff Goldbloom as he's not a singer.",literal
"The greatest tv series in history I was late to the party watching The Sopranos. I was expecting a shoot em' up, Godfather type show but couldn't have been more wrong.

I can't stop thinking about it.",literal

If one is from new mexico and worked--im retired--on the reservation, there is some things that are right,and the venues aren't bad, tho all in the eastern new mexico part of the reservation, not in kayenta, as the sory portends. The actors are mostly native, tho only a couple are dine. Of course NONE of them act like dine. They act like biligana, of course, looking directly at eachother all the time, talking aLOT, burying their dead near home.

Almost none live in trailers or bia housing, most are trim and fit instead of rural-poor obese. Alcoholism is ardly a problem.

Whatcha gonna do? Modern media production of edited hiller tales.

"Exploitative Ed Gein's real crimes were already horrific, but this series piles on invented murders (a babysitter, children, a romance) that never happened, turning him into a slasher villain. It ignores the truth: Gein was a deeply disturbed man, shaped by trauma and untreated psychosis, and in many ways a victim of the times himself. Who's to say he ever would have harmed children? By exaggerating and fictionalizing, the show disrespects both the real victims and the complexity of Gein's story.",literal
"Good Stuff Just a solid no-frills vampire movie. And by ""no frills"" I mean it does not feel too especially mired in vampire lore. Some of these movies get way into the weeds on what is true or false about vampires, like you'll have a big scene where a vampire grabs a crucifix and loudly proclaims, ""THAT WON'T WORK ON ME."" That kind of stuff.

Sinners has none of that. It assumes you know what's going on and kind of leaves it at that. It feels weird to say it, but that's surprisingly refreshing for a change.

Also wild to consider that special effects for an actor playing two versions of himself in the same scene have gotten so seamless and easy to do that I didn't even think about it here. Like, I know Michael B. Jordan doesn't have a twin brother, but it's so effortless and natural that I didn't even register it as anything. A totally invisible special effect (positive).

So it's a good vampire movie, but I especially love the epilogue. It's just a cool note to hang everything on.",figurative
"BEST SHOW EVER PERIOD!!!! Yes i write this after season 8! This is just the best show ever from start to finish in my opinion! The story, the acting, the music, the writing, the tension, the shocking moments, the entire world created...nothing can match Game of Thrones! But it's an adaptation from a series of books and it is so popular that it has a lot of pretentious viewers who are here to be the smartest and think they're writers. Of course you can be disappointed because a character didn't end up the way you wanted or because you wanted 10 episodes in season 7 and 8, yes me too! But when i hear that the writing is bad and season 8 is absolute garbage i can't help myself to think that these people don't have any opinion at all or never really liked this show or didn't actually watched the last season! The disrespect this show had after it ended is just disgraceful, damn i hate (most) people!",literal
"An honest review from a 40+ guy who read the book Really liked it, but it's not perfect.

Hard to judge how much of the liking is because of the 80:s (like Stranger Things) nostalgia, but it's far from all of it.

+ Kids act great, especially ""Ben Hanscom"". Good touch and psychology in the coming of age scenes. Dark and serious social stuff in between the jump scares. Like most Steven King stories, the best parts are in between the horrors. As a member of my own hometown's ""loser club"", as a kid, I really felt like I was one or all of the protagonists. The film has a good heart. Pennywise is a great mix of a powerful, psychopathic, godlike entity, and a playful kid. Scary and sad at the same time. Music is good too.


* The pacing feels rushed, scenes are stacked on top of each other in a ""too fast"" tempo, just to stay true to the book. We don't have enough time to really get to know our young heroes. I feel this movie could really have benefited from being 30-45 minutes longer, or even better, a 5-10 hour TV series.


I think this story is hard to do justice in 2 hours of film, but it does a good job, the visuals are also great. Art direction and all.

Overall: Way, way better than the weirdly over appreciated 90:s TV series. I saw that as a teenager, who really looked forward to it as well. It sucked then, and it sucks now. Don't understand how that production was ever talked about by fans. Tim Curry might have been OK, but the dialogue, makeup, production value, and acting (except the kids) was horrible.

This adaptation is 10 times better. Recommend it, if you like this sort of stuff.",literal
"The good thing is its not a remake Its not a remake of the Stephan King 1990 version this one last 2h but its all about the kids, its not set 20y after when they are adult like in the first one.

The effects are good, but you almost don't see Pennywise i was hoping to see more of him.

Kind of felt like how Freddy Krugger haunts in is victim in is dream a bit.

A lot in this movie does not make sense, but in 2017 what does, everything was rushed, the kids find Pennywise easy, they have a map of the swears how did they get that, and it all points to that old house that was burned.

A part from saying that those events with disappearing kids happen every 27 years that is all nothing is told about Pennywise this is kind of a let down... and there should have been more explanation on this.

Pennywise looks fantastic, but even then not enough for me to give this movie a higher rating then 6. Horror is gone its quit sad but the good old heavy metal plus horror of the 80 is done for.

Its sad but we will never ever get great movies like Night mare on elm street 3 and 4 or Friday the 13th 6 and 7.",literal
"Meh Decent storyline and cast but the cats were placed in the wrong roles I felt which made it hard to connect. Unconvincing as a mother who's lost her child and they are unconvincing as a couple.

Michael Pena isn't a tv detective either.

Could've wrapped it up in less episodes too.

Worth a watch everyone has different tastes and opinions.",literal
"Good show with some bad takes on things The show is detailed and shares a lot of relevant facts from the case. The show has an anti police narrative that exaggerates the knowledge everyone had of Dahmers crimes with the police doing nothing about it. The police certainly messed up bringing the child back to Dahmer but the neighbor (and others) in real life were not as self aware of what was going on as they were in the show. She did not know Dahmer was killing people and the show makes it seem like she told the police of that multiple times and they did nothing about it. I did not like how the show continuously pressed on that. Glenda Cleveland didn't even live next door to Dahmer in real life, she was way too relevant in the show. And so were the police who shouldn't have been. Outside of that, I enjoyed the show.",literal
"Great apart from Season 3! I ate up seasons 1 and 2, they were really well done and with intriguing plots and character studies.

Season 3, however... The first episode showed a lot of promise, and I was actually looking forward to the following episodes. However, as soon as the myriad of sub plots started I quickly lost interest and almost stopped after episode 4, but I pushed through (so you won't have to).

It seems to me like the show wanted to do a general study of infamous serial killers but needed a key character for the hook, and choosing Ed Gein makes sense, seeing as he was prolific and went on to inspire many other serial killers. But the balance is way off. There's too much fluff and non-factual plots and characters in the majority of the season compared to the actual Gein aspects.

There's characters we see a few times or even just once and then never again, some only mentioned in passing, but in a way that makes them seem important, like the son of the woman teaching ""Domesticated Husbandry"" is mentioned as someone we're supposed to know, but I could not for the life of me remember who he was, if we'd even seen or heard of him previously.

Of course there's a lot of gratuitous scenes as well, whether they be of the sexual/sensual or gory nature, classic Murphy.

The last episode especially was atrocious, as many others have attested, particularly ripping off Mindhunter, even with Happy Anderson reprising his role as Jerry Brudos, and at first I thought they had cast Holt McCallany as well, but it was just a look-a-like.

The season seems to practically celebrate Ed Gein as well as painting him as someone we should feel sorry for. Very little time is spent on the repercussions surrounding the victims and their families, as if they are just an afterthought or even entirely irrelevant.

When it comes to directing and writing, it was just messy, too many too blurred lines between reality and hallucinations to such a degree it was difficult to know how much of Ed's social life was real and how much of it was in his head.

I've had a lot of issues with several of Murphy's productions over the past few years and honestly think he has run out of original creativity and has just gotten used to churning out shows, making money and then moving on to the next. I really miss the earlier days of his stuff, the first four seasons of AHS were amazing for example. I wish the whole Murphy production team would take a break for a few years and come back with, hopefully, renewed creative juices!

I'd probably give seasons 1 and 2 a rating of 7-8 and I can't rate season 3 higher than a 2.",literal
"Be romantic through this! I wasn't certain about the reason yet I went gaga for both Joanne and Noah, their science does work...such a really entertaining show that made them laugh and grinning the whole way through. Extraordinary treatment of the points and opportune in the ongoing climate. Most certainly fun yet extraordinary messages too.

I cherished Kirsten Ringer in The Great Spot which is the reason I chose to watch No one Needs This and was compensated with a fantastic show. Adam Brody was splendid as Noah and the supporting cast were perfect and added to the fun of the show. Truly trust that there is a season 2 it is seriously mind-blowing. Energetically suggest.",figurative
Wrong Turn I really enjoyed the movie. I really like the first 3 seasons. What I don't like nor do I give a crap is Smurf's past intertwined with the story line. The girl who plays young Smurf looks nothing like her. It's not even plausible. Please stop. I don't why she is the way she is. We all know she's a heartless b*tch. Let it go.,literal
"Lovely, Heartfelt Comedy Anyone in senior living can tell you that the day to day happenings are crazy, much like what you will see in this show! But what is so difficult to convey to people not working in the building is the ups and downs you will go through and the family that you gain through the residents and staff. Every resident has a tough first day, isn't welcome to sit at the dining room tables because there is ALWAYS an unspoken seating chart that no one explains. It's couldn't have been easy but Michael Schur was able to convey the complexities of aging, memory issues, death, friendship, and family relationships brilliantly. Ted Danson did a wonderful job per usual. This is a wonderful show with humor, love, and great characters and you will fly through the 8 episodes wishing there were more to come!",literal
"Are horror films getting worse? I've been catching up on a lot of missed horror films lately, and the disappointment in the ongoing trope-leverage sinks deeper. From Barbarian to Longlegs to The Monkey, all these colossal borefests have lost touch of what horror is supposed to be: scary. Add Shelby Oaks to this list, and quite possibly the biggest offender. Nothing happens in this movie. Nothing. Even the revelation in the finale means nothing. It's another ""that's it?"" ending that is simply stupid.

One extra star for actress Camille Sullivan who has the arduous task of putting this whole movie on her shoulders and pulls it off. She remained engaging even when the film was reaching critical eye-rolling trope levels.

I don't know anything about Stuckmann, but read the reviews about he's some YouTuber who talks about what's wrong with horror films. Well he just contributed with his cliche, well, everything. I've seen this movie remade a thousand times, only it's a Frankenstein patch up comprised of everything you're used to seeing and the pace could not have been more pointless. It did not induce the fear. This is a YouTube movie that could've been made for $100k and run for 20 mins. Such an ineffectual addition to the genre.",figurative
"Too much hype for a just OK movie I really thought I was going to love Sinners even before I saw the glowing reviews, but after seeing so much hype I was really excited. Unfortunately my expectations weren't even close to being met.

Not a whole lot happens in this movie, to describe the plot would only take one sentence. The filming was done well and the music elevated the overall film but it just falls flat and it left me feeling unsatisfied.

"What??? The dialogue is totally unbelievable- f bombs we're rare in Dublin in the 1960's let alone a century earlier.

Also, the paper note on the door ( there's no Goof section yet ) reads "" an chéad uair eile"" which is grammatically & linguistically correct for late 20th century Irish; but before then would have been spelled ( spelt?) without the h and the dot over the letter I.

"It's OK but there are so many better shows.... I'm 60 and my mother is in a retirement home.

That's why I watched 4 episodes, but I'm done with it. It's OK, but it's exactly like someone wrote in a review: it does nothing for me. I don't find it funny, I don't find it touching, I don't find it interesting, nothing. I could watch it but I have better ideas for spending my time. :)

"Freeform You Will Pay For Your Crimes of Not Making More Films! No seriously, what happened Freeform!! You were doing so good in the 2010s releasing some of the best Christmas/Holiday films of the season. And even before that, I always tuned into ABC Family to watch a good holiday romcom. Ghosting: The Spirit of Christmas alone is a reason to not give up guys!! This film had all the beats of my favorite 2000s big romcoms. There was a very 27 Dresses singing in a bar while pining at each other scene that I would call an ode to that film. The female lead and her bff are very much in the style of Judy Greer and any of her main lead bestfriends, like same style of sarcastic banter with an underlying loving friendship to last the test of time. The conflict of the film reminded me of Leap Year, sort of enemies to lovers but maybe more victim turned mutually beneficial relationship to lovers lol. Another very rewatchable holiday film, romcoms aren't dead but they are very much at the bottom of the streaming site's symbolic $5 dvd barrel!",figurative
"One Of The Few Medical Shows That Gets It Right. I worked in EMS after training at a large teaching hospital. I rarely watch medical shows because the portrayal of medicine is so dumbed-down and inaccurate. I understand that it's a show and some license will be taken, but at least put in some effort to help me suspend disbelief. The Pitt puts in major effort to get it right (which I expect from creator of 'Southland' John Wells, one of the few cop shows that did it more accurately than most). ER's are places of extreme excitement, sadness and humor (the rat scene alone beat many comedies made today). It's fun to be a couple episodes into a medical show and looking forward to more instead of rolling my eyes and moving on.

Being Hollywood we get the usual moralizing, but most shows lecture while delivering inane dialogue with one dimensional characters. Give me a solid story in a realistic setting with great characters and I can sit through a fair share of finger-wagging. It's great seeing Noah Wylie in a hospital again, especially as a veteran doctor surrounded by fresh-faced medical rookies like he was in ER. The acting has been great from everyone. I recognize so many of these personalities from a career around this environment. The Pitt is a great new show.",literal
"Ploughing Through All Those Episodes At times it was a hard chore yet there was something about the series that kept me going back for more.

I have always liked Laura Linley, although most of her work has been in the lower grade of movie.

In the BIG C she was firmly established as the self-centred kind of person where everything was about her. The multiple expression of love for others never really lasted past the utterance of the phrases expressing love and there was always her concern about what others thought.

I liked the feature which included people like Susan Sarandon, Alan Alda, Hugh Darcy, and they lifted the quality of the show. Sarandon was particularly effective, which is no surprise.

One of the worst aspects of the show was the appalling ending, where the main character just gives up the ghost with not one word of summary, but just a middle class nothingness.

I also loathed the black woman, NOT BECAUSE SHE WAS BLACK, OR FAT, but because she just didn't fit into the narrative in any way.

Why did I binge watch the whole thing?

I have NO idea.",literal
"A future classic I'm not the biggest fan of musicals, but when they're very extremely well done like this one they leave me on a high for days. The level of effort and obvious passion put into every aspect of this movie is astonishing.

The main two actresses completely knocked it out of the park. Grande's Galinda is a showstopper you keep on waiting for to reappear on the screen. I was never really convinced of her acting abilities before, but now it's the complete opposite case. Ariana Grande has so much more to offer through musical and film than solely the popstar gig. Cynthia's Elphaba is striking and powerful. While she gets kind of overshadowed by Galinda in the first half of the movie, she completely takes over later on.

I can't wait to see the two of them performing ""Defying Gravity"" at the next Oscar's ceremony. It's a moment certain to happen.

I'd also like to point out what a heartfelt actor Jeff Goldblum is. Completely in love with him.

I'll be back at the cinema asap rewatching it 😁",literal
"I've seen better I've been to the Robin Hood Museum in Nottingham. They believe he is an amalgam of many forest bandits active in that period. Sean Bean is doing it f9r the money.

Eat watch ""Robin and Marian"" with Sean Connery and Audrey Hepburn.",literal
"Strong Performances, Stylish Atmosphere, but Uneven Storytelling Black Rabbit"" (2025) is a dark crime drama that brings together two heavyweight actors - Jude Law and Jason Bateman. Their on-screen chemistry is definitely the strongest part of the series. The performances feel raw and layered, and the visual style creates the perfect moody atmosphere for the story. From the very first episode, the cinematography and production design pull you into a gritty world of crime, betrayal, and family secrets.

That being said, the series often struggles with pacing. Some episodes feel longer than they need to be, with flashbacks and side plots that don't always add much. At times, the writing makes characters act in ways that feel unrealistic or hard to connect with emotionally. While the show sets up suspense well, several twists are predictable, and the narrative occasionally feels overloaded with too many themes at once.

Still, there are moments of genuine tension and intensity that make the journey worth watching. If you enjoy slow-burn thrillers with strong performances and a stylish look, ""Black Rabbit"" will likely keep you hooked, even if the story doesn't always deliver on its full potential.

Verdict: A solid but flawed series. Worth watching for Jude Law and Jason Bateman, but don't expect a masterpiece.

Rating: 7/10.",figurative
"""That Robin Stone...he's movin' on"" The network TV news business as a sleazy cesspool, with John Phillip Law as the titular news-anchor who sleeps his way to the top. Nice idea to have Dionne Warwicke do the song vocals for this movie-adaptation of Jacqueline Susann's bestseller (a la ""Valley Of The Dolls"")...though it's really too bad this sudser doesn't have Patty Duke's Neely O'Hara to spike the story. ""The Love Machine"" is unrelievedly dull. Even the final brawl (with an Academy Award as a fight prop!) can't save it. Dyan Cannon seems embalmed in her heavy pancake make-up and cumbersome fall (although her tiny, suntanned figure is a beauty to behold), Law is a handsome block of wood, while David Hemmings is embarrassing in gay-mode as a flamboyant photographer. And where is Robin Stone walking to at the end? Is he trekking out to the waterfront to pick up some sailors? After Cannon has deflated his masculinity, it would be a safe bet. In that case, ""Love Machine--The Final Episode"" might have been a more interesting flick. Certainly better than this yawn-inducing snooze-opera. *1/2 from ****",literal
"Lost It's Way NCIS was great when Gibbs, Tony, Abby and Ziva was there but without them NCIS has definitely lost its way Sure McGee is there but Sean Murray can't carry the show. So the producers brought in Gary Cole as Parker but he is overall another version of McGee. The cases barely has anything to do with Navy or Marines crimes. Also I miss David McCallum as Ducky Rest In Peace. They should scrap the Tony and Ziva spinoff and bring them back with Tony as leader. NCIS should dump Parker, Knight and Kasie.",literal
"Half baked show What happens if we remove the minutes of the characters' countless glances at the mockumentary cameras? Half the episode. Half the episode is based on breaking the fourth wall (looks at the cameras). The rest are a poorly executed series of jokes that would like to be comical, cringe, but fail miserably. I never laughed or smiled once. I imagine that this TV series will be renewed, but only because it has to cost very little, the actors are not so famous as to have a large salary, and the scenes always take place in the same 2-3 rooms and corridors. Because it's cheap, like the level of screenplay, which is the real problem that sinks this half baked TV series.",figurative
"Give Tracker a chance Tracker is a wonderful new TV series that I personally enjoy watching. There are many crime solving mystery drama shows out there that may feel a like however Tracker is different. The main character Colton Shaw finds people for reward money & at the same time, it's not about the money for Colton, he helps because of his compassion for others (some may view him having a complex of needing to save people). I am enjoying Justin Hartley's character (his good looks too). Give this show a chance. I am tired of seeing great shows getting cancelled after season 1. Especially when many great shows aren't advertised as they should be.",literal
"Entertaining with a great cast. After finishing episode 3, I can safely say this is well worth watching. Enjoy Emma Thompson who of course steals the show, and Ruth Wilson who also holds her own. Other players in the cast are all worthy as well. The story keeps you intrigued. It's not your usual crime drama as it has a bit of wackiness and its characters are all a quirky in their own way. If you're going to compare, do so with all the junk out there instead of why you deem the very best.",figurative

"Brilliant adaption. Well worth a watch. I enjoy Hillermans work and have learnt a lot about Navaho culture and conversely about my own reading his books...

Leaphorn and Chee are a solid addition to the crime genre and the first episode portrays them well.

The stories I have enjoyed on the page are brought to life delightfully. The most immediate impression is of space and silence and Dark Winds does this expansively.

Set in the 70s, an alien landscape (but recogniable from so many films) following the lives of people who live there.

Story (not canon but ok) builds nicely, the characters are strong and an awesome cast who fill aforementioned landscape with well sculptured theatre.

"Sadly not quite the real deal, though it pretends it is The irritating thing about The Diplomat is that it is an opportunity lost. At a certain level much of our lives is determined by decisions over which we have no control. We might think that because 'we live in a democracy' and 'get to vote every few years' we do have that control. But it is a fiction - we do not.

Once the man or woman we vote into office, whether at a national level or a state/county or municipal level is actually in office, the 'control' we foolishly pride ourselves on having is lost. Those men or women are - almost, but not quite - autonomous.

As far as we are concerned, all they need worry about is that every four or five years (according to the electoral cycle) they need to butter us up, 'get us onside', renew our support for them, make sure we re-elect them, then it is back to making their decisions without giving us a second thought.

Certainly, there are grand claims that they 'only have the interests of the country/nation/state at heart'. But that's only true in theory: in practice they are like you and I: they are human. And the important decisions they make - as in The Diplomat over the deaths of 40 odd servicemen and woman and how to react - are sadly as much governed by the individual human quirks and failings of those in high post as by 'the principles involved'.

This series had a chance to look at and 'explain' the goings on of diplomats and politicians at the highest level and draw us in, to involve us, to help us understand. But it preferred, at the end of the day to be what is, let's be honest, just another glossy soap opera.

That is not to say a more 'realistic' portrayal of dealings at the highest level would have been dry and dull, so we, the viewer needed something 'more human'. In the right hands such a portrayal might very well have avoided being dry and dull. But The Diplomat chose not to take a chance. It went for safe.

Safe means having a dash of this - sex both real and potential, 'relationships', the semblance of 'intrigue' and so on - and hoping that given the trappings of the show - presidents, prime ministers, official residences, helicopters and so on - the viewer will accept that what The Diplomat is 'the real thing' or pretty darn close to 'the real thing'.

But it isn't: at the end of the day The Diplomat is just another - very glossy - TV show. There's nowt wrong with that, of course, except The Diplomat does pretend to be more. But it isn't. As I say from where I sit it is an opportunity missed.",literal
"Has it where it counts As cynical as I am about Disney movies, I freely admit that I liked ""Moana"" quite a bit. It wasn't exactly a challenge with Dwayne Johnson's involvement, but the elements that are usually a turn-off . . . weren't. The songs are good, the animation's beautiful, and the formulaic heroine with sidekicks really seem to work here.

Cynically speaking, Moana is just another princess for the Mouse's stable. Having said that, you could do with a lot worse. She's got the spunk and strong personality to be a winning character, and she really makes this an enjoyable story.

I could easily watch this again.

"Best Ending The ending of Black Rabbit was, in my opinion, one of the best and most balanced conclusions a series could have. It wrapped up the story in a way that felt both fair and emotionally satisfying, staying true to the characters and the journey they went through.

What stood out to me most was how the show didn't force a dramatic twist just for shock value. Instead, it gave each character the resolution they earned, and the choices they made throughout the story truly mattered in the end. The finale managed to deliver closure without losing the emotional depth that made the series special.

In an age where so many shows stumble at the finish line, Black Rabbit ended with honesty, justice, and heart. It was the kind of ending that makes you sit quietly for a few moments after the screen fades to black - not because you're confused, but because you're satisfied.",figurative
"Nothing else but all Love for this film! It was absolutely worth the year-long wait. After the goosebumps I got from Wicked Part 1, I already had high expectations and watching this one in IMAX made the experience even more magical. I knew it was going to be great, and it truly delivered.

The music in this film is phenomenal. Every song fits perfectly, but for me, nothing will ever top ""Defying Gravity"" and ""The Wizard and I."" Those two songs remain unmatched-they're the heart-stopping, mind-blowing moments of the entire franchise.

What I loved most about this movie is how much it centers on Elphaba and Glinda and their friendship, their connection, and how their choices shape their world. Even when Dorothy enters the picture, the story never strays from the two of them. It's their journey, their bond, and their heartbreak that hold the film together.

The ending still hit hard, even though I already knew what was coming from part one. Watching Glinda break down over what happened to Elphaba was sad, but it also felt right for both of them. It was painful, but it made sense-for their good, and for the story.

Overall, Wicked: For Good is truly one of the best films of the year. The wait was worth every second, and I really hope it finally gets the recognition it deserves. This movie is pure magic.",figurative

Come on do better, this could have been SO good, it was a great idea. All the characters are so weak and it's insulting to the watcher.

"It's a special show I, like most people, enjoy shows the most when they have a combination of certain elements; quality acting, a topic of interest to me, a fitting soundtrack, proper character development, etc. Above all of those qualities though, sits the most important aspect of a television series or movie - the ability to draw emotional involvement from the viewer. A select few have had the capacity to foster the bittersweet happiness that comes from finishing something you've been so invested in. It's an odd thing when something can evoke sadness - and yet a sadness you don't wish to push away, but to wallow in, if at least for a little while. Stranger Things has met that mark.

A particularly interesting part of this series is the journey of maturation the child actors are partaking in. It goes without saying that Millie Bobby Brown is a shooting star in the acting world and is far from her zenith. The rest of the party performs laudably, and seeing them get their big break is a fun thing to behold.

David Harbour complements Millie's performance with a terrific effort as Chief Jim Hopper. Both excel in portraying the qualities which define what it is to be human; the idiosyncrasies, the varied nature of our individual capabilities, and the ways in which we cope with these strengths and weaknesses.

The plot of the show, while not bad, fails to live up to the far-reaching standards of the other aspects. Especially in Season Three, it seems a struggle to find ways to continue the plot; sometimes resulting in contrived and lackluster turns. Despite these shortcomings, this show remains a phenomenon which I'm happy to have experienced.",figurative
"A brilliant series (ruined by its final season) Gilmore Girls is a heartwarming, coming-of-age dramedy with top ""rewatchability"" factor. It's got charm, fast-paced banter and a slew of well-rounded female characters.

That said, beware the final season where it loses most of the things that made it loveable.

While it was also ahead of its time, it was still (in some ways) a show of its time - so expect a rare handful of jokes that haven't dated too well.

Overall, would recommend it for most of everyone as a well-loved and feel-good classic.",literal

She seems so much older than Rock Hudson that the love interest between them is unbelievable and seems silly. I thought she seems old enough to be his mother. Why do blind people in movies not recognize the voice of someone known prior to blindness? This also makes the story unbelievable. There is much music, mostly Chopin, in the background (coming to the foreground frequently). Rock Hudson's car is one of the most interesting items in this movie. A blind person would surely recognize the sound, smell, feel of a car like this! Based on this car and Hudson's valiant work to carry this movie, I give this a 5 star rating.",literal

It's a peculiar, unique, charming story of a real life criminal who ended up living in a Toy store after escaping jail.

Channing Tatum's performance will have you rooting for him, its a fun drama with funny moments, suspense and nostalagia. Kirsten Dunst does a good job with her character and Peter Dinklage is great as well.

"This is a painful addition to the action genre XXx (2002) is a movie I recently rewatched for the first time in a long time on Tubi. The storyline follows an extreme sports vigilante of sorts who is hired by the government to infiltrate an international crime ring, discover their ambitions and help stop them.

This movie is directed by Rob Cohen (Dragonheart) and stars Vin Diesel (Pitch Black), Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction), Marton Csokas (The Equalizer), Asia Argento (Land of the Dead) and Danny Trejo (Machete).

This concept was awful and many of the action scenes are too over the top and ridiculous. There are some great special effects and action scenes. The soundtrack is awesome too. The Danny Trejo scene was hilarious and his use of ""Mr. Funny Guy"" always cracks me up.

""Bitches come"" is also a legendary quote from this movie. Argento's character's evolution didn't make sense based on her background and the one-liners were really bad. The ending also isn't good.

This is a painful addition to the action genre where if felt like the studios were just trying to take advantage of X Games premises at the time and the success of The Fast and Furious. I would score this a 3/10 and recommend skipping this.",literal

This true crime comedy is a great way to share the story of Roofman. The story seems impossible, but Jeffrey Manchester managed to do it. There is a lot of comedy and fun throughout, with some drama mixed in to drive home the gravity of his actions. The two-hour and six-minute runtime is excessive, where parts of the movie feel stretched with no added benefit. The true story is entertaining and captivating enough for a stream when available.",literal
"if Steve Martin and Martin Short collaborate, then you're in for something good And boy are you with ""Only Murders in the Building""! This clever miniseries is a parody of/homage to true crime podcasts, with Martin's and Short's characters (along with a young woman played by Selena Gomez) investigating a murder in their New York apartment building. Plenty of surprises are in store, and there's great chemistry among the cast members (including some guest stars).

You're sure to love every part of it.",literal
"Amazing Series I really didn't think I'd like this series as I'm not particularly a fan of any western cowboy and Indian type programmes or films. But after a million recommendations, I'm so glad I tried it. I quickly became a huge fan of the family, the land and how much it meant to them. The work they put into keeping the ranch going was incredible. I must say that Beth was ultimately my favourite character all throughout with her savageness. Watching and hearing what she'd been through and then watching her settle down was lovely. I won't name anything as I don't want to spoil for anyone deciding if they want to watch. The only thing I was deeply upset about was John Duttons exit as it seemed very abrupt but now that I know what happened behind the scenes it makes sense why things went the way that they did and it was a brilliant story line. If John Dutton had survived I would of rated a 10 lol.",literal

"Brilliant It's honestly hard to find anything that I don't like about this show. It's creative, it's down to Earth, and my favorite part has to be the Devil at episode 8, he was a delight to watch.

"Wow Evan...wow!! This is so well done and Evan Peters is stellar as Dahmer! He did so well that I am concerned for his mental health after this.

The accuracy and reminder of the absolute dumpster fire the police created made me angry all over again.

Ryan Murphy once again knocks it out of the park with his amazing story telling. I really hope that he, Evan and Neicy are all recognized for their amazing abilities to tell a story.

I feel that framing this one in a mini series format allowed the full and total story to be told in the most thorough way possible. While the subject matter is disgusting, they tell the story as completely, without being gratuitous or overly gruesome, keep in mind it's a serial killing cannibal we're talking about, but it's well done.",figurative
"Love it! A well made and well acted mystery.

This show reminds my husband and I of the Jesse Stone movies with Tom Selleck. We both love a good murder mystery and these are very good, without being too gory and evil. Although, I guess murder is kinda evil.

The scenery is so idyllic. And there's a little romance too!

The Police Chief is a divorcee from a big city, who moved to this quaint sea town. The love interest is the town librarian who is hesitant to get involved with him, but of course, they get together.

Love the characters and the actors.

I still can't get over the police chief being Donald Sutherland's son.

I hope it is given a second season and time to develop further.",literal
"Every technical and style detail is wrong. They obviously did not use any sort of technical experts or cultural advisors. Not about law enforcement, aviation, wilderness search and rescue, not even hospital operations. It's clear they never spoke to anyone from Alaska or that knew anything about Fairbanks.

I get the need for creative story telling choices. But every single thing they got wrong and not just a little wrong, there was no creativity or artistic choices. The prop and production staff were clearly using by-the-book out of date style guides not intended for location driven stories. It would have worked fine for a generic police procedural set in a nondescript mainland/lower 48 urban landscape where prop and location details don't matter. But they got everything wrong.

One example; the theft of the aircraft black box, they showed the ""ambush"" taking place on a small bridge on narrow road. In reality the road from where they put their location and ""on the way to Anchorage"" would have been the Park's Highway, very wide, very flat, with the vegetation further cut back from the pavement.

It wouldn't have impressed production to use technical advisors and at the very least local knowledge. The last season of True Detective took place in Alaska while being filmed in Iceland. It was visually very different from Alaska they still managed to capture some of the feeling of a large Alaskan village.",literal
"Not About Death, Rather How We Live The movie hits like a gut punch. Brutal, unrelenting, and strangely beautiful-I came away numb, but in awe.

It's superbly written and brilliantly acted, all the more impressive given that almost the entire film takes place on the road. The premise is simple and clear from the start, but the real hook is the characters. You find yourself attached almost instantly-some you like straight away, others not at all-until they reveal their true selves, and suddenly you can't help but care for them.

At first, I saw it as a terrifying mirror of where the world could be headed. A dystopia where survival is reduced to endurance, where the system can't sustain everyone, and where lives are stripped down to a brutal contest of who can keep going the longest. It's a chilling thought, and one that feels uncomfortably close at times.

But somewhere along the way, the film became less about how scary the world might become, and more about how to get through it. What really struck me is that those who seem most at peace near the end of their journey aren't the strongest, the fastest, or the fiercest competitors. They're the ones who care for others, who seek genuine friendship, who invest in the people around them. That's what makes the walk bearable. That's what makes it meaningful.

And here's the kicker: whether or not you would choose to play the game in The Long Walk, you're already playing a version of it. We're all walking, step by step, burning energy to stay in the race. We push forward, hoping to outlast, to achieve, to matter-knowing full well that the finish line is the same for everyone.

The only real question is: how do you choose to walk your walk?",figurative
"NOT a comedy For the love of God, why is this movie categorized as a comedy?! It is a dark psychological drama, period. Not a dark comedy, not a thriller.

Rose Byrne delivers an amazing acting performance, but don't see this movie because you thought she was funny in Bridesmaids. You will be sorely disappointed.",literal
"Strong, Emotional, Deep, Meaningful With its emotional and meaningful story about strong bonds of brotherhood, it resembles life rather than a TV series. It is the most amazing production I have ever watched and it has a big place in my life. We have a lot of similarities with the character Sam. It was an unforgettable series with the harmonious chemistry of Sam and his older brother Dean and interesting characters. My first favorite is season 7. Although each season was enjoyable in its own way, I liked some of them more. Sam is deeply devoted to his brother and is always ready to make sacrifices for him. There's nothing Dean wouldn't do for Sam. They are always there for each other. Sam, who is rebellious, emotional and has a hard-to-control anger, and his aggressive, sweet-loving hero older brother Dean, who protects him, become the nightmare of the villains. Thank you Supernatural for 15 seasons.",literal
"Fantastic show that killed my spirit. This is a hard show to review. The first few seasons were incredible but I feel that they dragged it out too long. As the weeks go by I found myself thinking ""really, there are 5 seasons of this"". I am truly diverse in my tastes and don't get offended very easily at all. I love gore, gritty, sci-fi, fantasy, comedy, romance, animation. You get the picture I really do not discriminate and instead judge on it's merits. But I found that Breaking Bad exhausted me. Five seasons of disgusting, corruption, ferralness, deplorable human behaviour took it's toll on my level of appreciation for this show. If it had been shorter I would have enjoyed it more. I know it was revolutionary and truly realistic but in the end I despised it for being great and the fact that I had to see it through to the end.

I know people will think I am mad for writing this but does a show that is fantastic but sucks the soul and heart out of you make for as good TV as everyone believes; or was everyone else too caught up in the hype to admit their true feelings about Breaking Bad.",literal
"First mid-season show EVER that I actually liked If you think ABC can't get any better - you're wrong. With the great success over smash-hits, ""Desperate Housewives"" and ""Lost"" they also picked up a few shows over mid-season hoping for more success. They got ""Jake in Progress,"" ""Eyes"" and ""Grey's Anatomy"" - but ""Grey's Anatomy"" is definitely considered the best out of those three.

Grey's Anatomy stars Ellen Pompeo (who has starred in a few movies but was never really noticeable) as the narrator - Meredith Grey. Her mother is the famous surgeon and she is trying to follow in her mother's footsteps. The story revolves around her time as an intern and the people she meets and sort of is portrayed as ""survival camp for medical students."" The minute she arrives at work, she meets Christina Yang (Sandra Oh - flawless in her bitchy supporting role), George O'Malley (T.R. Knight - one word: breakthrough performer), Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heighl - very, very believable as a model who is more like the girl-next-door), and Alex Karev (Justin Chambers - plays sort of a not-so-likable person). Most of all, there is Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey - very attractive), the man that Meredith had a one-night stand with - he just happens to be her boss.

This is a show that wants to be liked. It just sort of screams in your face ""Love me!"" with all its interesting characters who are very different from each other and a nice plot that you just have to be addicted to. The supporting work is clearly a winner. It has a very lovable supporting cast with T.R. Knight as the sweet and sort of the ""average guy"" as George O'Malley and Katherine Heigl who is very likable in her role - even Sandra Oh is a clear winner on top. And my personal favorite is ""the Nazi"" - Dr. Miranda Bailey who is played by Chandra Wilson. Very, very well done.

This is sort of a soapy spin on ""Scrubs"" and ""ER"" but with light comedy/romance and serious and intense drama where character build up the plot. Some of the characters may get a bit annoying for your taste (ex. Meredith Grey) but the acting is just superb and you can't help liking it. It has a guilty-pleasure feel to it and you just can't help but stay up late for this show. This show is definitely not about ""medicine"" - when it has to deal with medicine, it has a clear soft side to it. The doctors play heroes (pretty clichéd, but yeah - this IS a hospital show) and save lives or care or has to live up to certain defeat. Just to be aware: This is a show about relationships-within-a-hospital and the life of each person that works there.

The show breaks all the ""bad"" mid-season shows record. It is just extremely enjoyable. Go check it out - you'll definitely like it if not love it.",figurative
"A Buzzing Mess That Should Have Stayed in the Hive If Bugonia proves anything, it's that Yorgos Lanthimos has officially run out of strange things to say and is now just throwing bees, metaphors, and random absurdities at the screen hoping someone will call it genius. Spoiler: it's not.

The film buzzes with self-importance but delivers nothing but confusion and eye-rolls. It's like watching a two-hour perfume commercial directed by someone who hates storytelling. Every frame screams, ""Look how artistic I am!"" while the audience quietly wonders if they should just check their phone.

The performances are flat, the dialogue sounds like it was written by ChatGPT in nightmare mode, and the plot-if you can even call it that-flies around aimlessly before collapsing under the weight of its own symbolism.

By the time the credits roll, you're left feeling not enlightened, not provoked, but simply exhausted. Bugonia isn't bold, it's bloated. It's not thought-provoking, it's thought-exhausting.",literal
"Among the best and most addictive shows there is 'Breaking Bad' is one of the most popular rated shows on IMDb, is one of those rarities where every season has either been very positively received or near-universally acclaimed critically and where all of my friends have said nothing but great things about.

Very few shows in recent memory had me so hooked from the very start that before the week was over the whole show had been watched, especially when for a lot of shows now airing watching one episode all the way through can be an endeavour. 'Breaking Bad' had that effect on me, and its reputation as one of the best, consistently brilliant and most addictive shows in many years (maybe even ever) is more than deserved in my eyes. Its weakest season is perhaps the first season, understandable as any show's first season is the one where things are still settling.

Actually everything is established remarkably from the very start, but once the writing and characterisation becomes even meatier the show reaches even higher levels.

Visually, 'Breaking Bad' is one of those shows that is both stylish and beautiful, with photography and editing that are cinematic quality and put a lot of films today to shame, where there are a lot of visually beautiful ones but also some painfully amateurish looking ones. The music always has the appropriate mood, never too intrusive, never too muted.

The writing for 'Breaking Bad' is a fine example to all shows of how to have a lot of style but also to have a lot of substance. The dialogue throughout is thought-provoking and tense, while also have a darkly wicked sense of humour and heart-tugging pathos. The stories are texturally rich, intimate, tense and layered, with the pace of them consistently deliberate but taut. The direction couldn't be better.

Can't say anything bad about the acting. Bryan Cranston is phenomenal as one of the most fascinating anti-heroes, or even of any kind of character, in either film or television. Aaron Paul has never been better and Anna Gunn is affecting. The characters are compelling in their realism.

Overall, describing it as brilliant doesn't do 'Breaking Bad' justice. 10/10 Bethany Cox",figurative
"Sheldon, Sheldon, Sheldon When Nerds and Geeks rise up and are the main ingredients of a sitcom that works quite well. Including the villain itself who's also the friend, who's also quite oblivious to what he's doing while being the smartest in the room. Well something along those lines.

There are clear lines and there are some decent jokes at the expense of certain individuals. But overall you will come to learn the main characters and love them. Cliches? Yes. Archetypes and all that. And some of the things may only apply or be funny if you indulge them.

Having said that, there is so much fun to be had. And as far as sitcoms go, this may have one of the most satisfying and best endings I can think of ... I was surprised when I saw that high rating on the final episde, but after watching it, I have to say I do agree. So if for nothing else, this may very well be one of the reasons to watch the whole thing! You will not be dissapointed (even if it contains the now outdated laugh track throughout)",literal
"Exactly what I needed! This show definitely has the same feel as superstore, which I absolutely adored. There are a couple of the same actors from superstore too, and it's fun to see them in different roles. It feels like parks and rec, the office, abbot elementary and so many shows of this style. If you don't like that style of show, then you're not going to like this, but if you do, it's a winner!

Each episode gets funnier as you get to know the characters. There are sweet moments too. I love it and I hope it's not just another one that the network cancels without giving it a chance to get grounded. I was looking for a funny show that makes you feel good and I was so pleased to find this. It's exactly what the doctor ordered!",literal
"First act doesn't equal whole movie There's a reason everything that happens in the movie is just the first act of the musical. It's not strong enough of an arc on its own to support a whole piece of work.

Yes Elphaba's first flight is a big moment, but not so big to where ending on it felt satisfying. It's like we only watched the exposition. She is labeled as wicked. Then it's over?

It feels like rather than just translate the show to the screen - which they could have done with the excellent cast as well as having Winnie Holzman and Stephen Schwartz on board - they just tried to cash in on two theatrical releases.

The songs were done well at least.",literal
"Commit To Watching The Entire Series--It's WORTH It! Where to start?

This intelligent, half-hour Showtime offering has its comic moments, but trust me, this is NOT a comedy.

""Nurse Jackie,"" a brilliant ensemble series, is worth your time and attention, for several reasons.

1. EDIE FALCO. Need I say more?

2. Some of the best writing to be found. Dialogues ring true; situations are (mainly) plausible.

3. Incredibly accurate portrayals of both ER life and addiction. As a nurse myself, I can say this is the most on-point show created in terms of authenticity.

4. Highly entertaining comic relief from the talented Merrit Wever. The show would not shine as brightly without her. Watch her superb physicality in some of her scenes. Wever is a gem! She deserved that Emmy. 

5. Although some episodes/plot arcs were a bit tedious, overall this series is lean and taut.

After a tremendous finale (truly perfect, by my reckoning), I felt somewhat emotionally overwhelmed and in need of some discussion with others. But I live in Asia, and nobody I know watches it. So I lurked on a few forums...

The most astute observation I came across said this: Jackie's primary addiction was to nursing; her secondary addiction--drugs--only facilitated (in her mind, at least) her ability to pursue nursing, albeit in an obsessive, all-encompassing way.

I've encountered nurses like this. I feel it has something to do with entering a profession that is under-validated, undervalued, and less visible than MDs, that finds some nurses becoming too intensely identified with their roles as healers/martyrs/unsung ""saints."" (Jackie was oft called a saint, and it was an important thread throughout).

But here's the kicker: (IMO) This is NOT a learned reaction stemming from their ""secondary"" roles to MDs; rather, it is a career (and life) CHOICE and DECISION (albeit unconsciously, in most cases) to pursue the saint//martyr role from the beginning. I've seen this choice played out with many nurses and EMTs. 

Looking at Jackie's obsession through this lens makes me truly appreciate the nuanced writing and acting that brings this subtlety to light.

Commit to this engaging series and just muddle through the occasional sub-par bits. It's truly worth it. And watch it with another/others if you can. You might just need some ""talk therapy"" when it's all over!",figurative
"Read the book On subsequent viewings this is not a bad film really, but i was so disappointed when i first saw it as in comparison to the book it is rubbish.

The book was written under Stephen King's pseudonym Richard Bachman and is the best thing he has produced under this nom-de-plum.  A novel which is 100% plot and consequently moves like a steam train, it also provides a bleak 'Blade Runner-esque' vision of the future, but from a lower class perspective.  I had high hopes for the film, but they were dashed utterly as the result wasn't anything like the book other than the names of a few characters and the basic premise of a game show where the prize is your life.

Social commentary? Gone. Bleak vision of the future? Minimal. Plotline? Gone. Cataclysmic ending? Gone.

A real shame and a missed opportunity for a truly great film and given the events on 9/11, probably missed permanently now - certainly no one is going to finance a remake with the original ending intact these days.

So, my advice is to see the film before you read the book.  If you like the film then the book will come as a revelation and you will see my point of view, but if you have read the book already, then give the film a wide berth as you are bound to be disappointed.

However, it is not a total loss - viewed independantly of the book it is a reasonable Arnie movie, PMG does a pretty good job directing and the effects are OK for the time too.  The score is also pretty good and in general the performances are up to the task.  This is a 'Friday night after the Pub' movie, don't expect anything too deep, the book has depth, the film is all surface.",literal
"Lots of liberties taken here If you are a Tony Hillerman fan, you will cringe like I did with the liberties that they have taken with the characters and the series.

Now having said this - My wife and I just finished watching the first season. I will say that it's a good whodunnit overall and the actors are fairly believable in their roles. I loved Hillerman's explanation of Navajo traditions and customs, and the show does tend to include some of them, which adds to the overall flavor and experience.

We're starting season two now and it appears that it will be another good whodunnit. I just have to grit my teeth with they way they have played fast and loose with the main characters.",literal
"Last cash grab standing A samurai battle royal! Where could you go wrong?

Well Netflix found a way......

After 2 episodes I find myself just bored and uninterested. The characters are pretty good and the plot is pretty bland. Rich guys making people fight to kill off the samurai I guess.

Everything just seems so cheap, there's even a scene where you can see the actor accidentally bend his rubber hand guard that should be metal. Swinging around swords as if they're weightless. Most of the violence happens so quickly or in a dark setting so you can't really see much. I really wanted this to be good but it's just a cheap squidgame recipe with a samurai coating.

Its not dramatic as Mad Men, its dramedy in feminine kind of way. And the costumes!!! Very enjoyable every scene shot has beautiful details, the years, atmosphere. Love it! Well done Apple Tv!

"just a simple detective series I find that there are quite a few inconsistencies in the script that aren't explained or resolved by the actors' roles.

Besides, I find this version a bit bland. It's a good detective series like the Americans know how to make. There's certainly the high potential aspect which adds something. But I find that the 'disadvantages', of being an high potential, are not put forward. High potentials have difficulty adapting to society, to social interaction, to authority or to an offbeat sense of humour. And I find that only the 'intelligent' good side of being a HP is highlighted here. To come to the comparison with the original French version: I find that the French version is more transparent about the disadvantages of being a HP, which makes the series perhaps more realistic and easier to identify with. It's this slightly 'crazy, shameless and offbeat' side that makes the main character endearing and the series interesting, far from having been exported to so many countries. The American version is smoother, simpler, a bit boring and more politically correct. It's clear that French humour is unique and difficult to imitate. Some people prefer it because it's less 'too much' or less annoying, perhaps less flashy, less crazy and even less focused on the lead actress, and that's a credit to them. But it's precisely the whole essence of the series that's missing from the American version. Perhaps season 2 will take these criticisms into account and be better suited to the moral of the series as intended by the original creators.",literal
"The best historical shows I've seen in years Mike Makowski has done a brilliant job in taking an somewhat obscure event from over 140 years ago and turning it into a fascinating and compelling drama.

It is not an exaggeration to say every one of the leading actors was beyond believable--they were amazing. An absolute must see.",literal

As adaptation it is very true, excellent, not perfect (not convinced perfect exists), but closest to perfect as possible. Just does everything right.

As a TV show it is solid plus, above solid and very good, with some excellent parts. Side characters are not there just for the sake of it. Story is more complex then it seems, combined with exposition reduced to bare minimum, paying attention is crucial, or of importance at least..

Overall, Fallout was, and is a pleasant surprise.",literal
"Love this show I read a lot of its not the same. Of course it's not the same. If it was then why bother doing it? I love the fact that this shows Gibbs as the Probie. Plus the fact that during that time, computers were just hitting the market. It's in sync with everything the power went out on NCIS and Gibbs told his team that they had ti do it old school. This is his learning period. When I see him starting as a Probie, it reminds me of how McGee started. It plays right into the theme. I absolutely love this. My grandkids can't believe that we didn't have computers back then. They are learning the way things worked, and that you can get the job done.

"Yes, run - away from this This is a movie with a message, and the message is: this is not a good movie. It's very badly written. The acting is awful. It isn't even well lit, making you long for an earlier era when that was kind of a minimum.

""The Running Man"" keeps hitting you over the head letting you know it's set in the future, and it's a bad future. But it never feels like anyone who knew or cared about science-fiction or action had a thing to do with it. It does feel like, some people with way more money than sense decided you didn't need to know anything about making movies to make one. And if they knew anyone with knowledge about how to make a good one, they went way out of their way not to ask them about it.

It doesn't even work as a piece of lowly exploitation, unless a few shots of Maria Conchita-Alonso in form-fitting Lycra are enough to make you blush. I was stunned to recall critics of this era said Arnold Schwarzeneger was not a good actor, since his performance is the only thing that makes this tolerable to watch for even a second. Richard Dawson's attempts to portray a malevolent game-show host are something that should have been left on the cutting-room floor of ""Family Feud.""

Lacking any type of momentum, the movie makes attempts to whip up emotion in the viewer, attempts which work out as ludicrously failed as everything else.

Not helping anything either is the fact that fashion has moved on, and people do not usually appear covered in Lycra nowadays, as they do in ""Running Man."" And for that, at least, I feel grateful.",literal
"This Show Needs More Love, Its Great I thought this was a really great mystery thriller mini series, characters are solid, story is intriguing, the mystery aspect to it allows the audience to ask questions while watching and I think that's part of what makes this mini series great.

Kinda sucks that this only has a 5.9 on IMDb, I think that is way too low.

The episodes never feel like they drag, they are paced well and I wasn't really bored through most of it I would say.

One thing that stood out to me was that Toni Collette is clearly the biggest name in the show and yet she wasn't the star in the show, I feel everyone had their time to show what they can do and I'm curious if that was by design.

Mae Martin as Alex Dempsey was a great protagonist and easily my favourite character. And being the creator of the show is also amazing, they did a great job.

Very consistent throughout, if it had absolutely nailed the finale I could have given this an even higher score but they didn't unfortunately. Not perfect but still very good.

Highly recommend this mini series.

"Just okay It's not bad, it's not great, I wasn't drawn in from the first two episodes but i'll give it a few to really decide.

The plot seems kind of meh. I think a lot of the reviews are overrated. Not even close to Breaking Bad or Better Call Saul, I loved both.

Without giving it away, it feels like they forced the storyline.. you didn't really get time to get a feel for the characters before it gets into where its heading. Where it's heading is a mystery, but not necessaril one that has me excited. Compared to something like Silo where I was a bit bored initially but they did a really good job building up the characters before getting deeper into it. That made it much more exciting and wanting to see how the plot developed. I don't get the same sense here.",figurative

"Well Crafted, A Return to the Art of Movie Making I really liked this movie. To me, it was well crafted and didn't rely on gratuitous violence, foul language, and absurdity to tell a story.

The attention to detail and cinematography was top shelf. Do they give Oscars for set and prop execution? The beauty is in the details as we follow Leo on this two and half hour journey. The film is authentic and approachable without missing any Hollywood glamor. And while it is long, it is seamless and without technical fault.

And at times it is mesmerizing, reflective art. The car ""chase"" is as suspenseful as any over the top chase, if not more so, and shot with artists and a new approach.

The movie is simply beautiful in the small and the large ways.

The characters are relatable and for such a simple film, they are interesting and dare I say complex to a certain extent. There isn't a character in here that isn't interesting. This a testament to good writing, good acting, and good direction...and good casting. My favorite in some ways was Benicio Del Toro who brings calm and down to earth grounding to an anxiety inducing middle of the movie, along with some low key humor. He's a good friend to all, and that makes a great character, beer in hand.

Chase Infiniti does a fantastic job acting, brining a strong performance to the big screen.

Leo brings his usual great acting, and his character has humor that is authentic and would be hard not to embrace.

And Sean Penn provides a master class in odd ball behavior and method acting.

This is easily a 8/9 out of 10 and should have good re-watch ability.",figurative
"Animal Kingdom : Hands Down - one of the best tv dramas ever So I judge a series (and its finale) by how emotionally bothered I am afterwards. And how long that gnawing upset lasts. I am at 24 hours past the finale and I still need therapy. Lol. What a show! What a story line! What writing! What cinematography! And most importantly - what stellar performances by every member of that cast! ""Animal Kingdom"" (a very accurate title) centers on The Cody Family. Matriarch Janine Cody (""Smurf""), Andrew Cody, Craig Cody, Deran Cody, Baz Blackwell (adopted son), and Josh Cody. Andrew, Craig, and Deran are half brothers and all biological sons of Janine. Baz is an adopted (actually stolen) son. And Josh is Janine's 17 year old grandson, who joins the family after his mother Julia Cody (an estranged daughter of Janine) dies of a drug overdose. This is the quintessential Socal white trash crime family - except that they are particlularly smart and skilled. The series follows their family exploits in present time. The last three seasons add in a parallel story arc set 30 years in the past which tells the ""origin"" story of The Cody Family. The show is captivating. And while ""bad is bred"" - as the show's tagline reads - this is a ""bad"" that sucks viewers in. And in a way that only Hollywood knows, the viewer is left rooting for and ultimately shaken by the tribulations that befall The Cody Family.",literal
"Keeper (2025) Movie Review Keeper was just an okay horror film, but I was left a little unsatisfied!

Osgood Perkins just hasn't made a movie that I love yet and I'm really trying to root for him. Because he has a great eye for visuals, especially in this film. Tatiana Maslany delivers a terror filled leading performance, and there's some horrifying imagery in the back half. Perkins also creates a dreadful atmosphere throughout the film, and that's one thing that he is the most consistently good at as a director in my opinion.

But that's honestly where my positives end with Keeper because this film DRAGS through its first two acts. But when it finally picked up the pace, my score went up dramatically. The transitions between scenes were also pretty distracting at times, and they kept taking me out of the movie. It just felt like he was spamming them to seem ""artsy"". While the pacing is really slow, the script still feels like it's rushing in the third act to get to its conclusion. That's where most of my unsatisfaction came from to be honest.

Overall though, I would recommend checking out Keeper for yourself if you're a horror movie fan to see where you land on it. Because some people are absolutely loving it! I was just not one of those people unfortunately.

SCORE CARD 2.75/5 5.5/10 ""One of the Movies of All Time""",literal
"Typical slop I'm really not a fan of this director. If you liked the IT movies he made, you'll probably like the show. I've only seen the 1st episode, so maybe it'll improve, but feels just as surface level as the movies did.

Not well developed characters. Just really poor dialogue. Setting feels more like a CGI representation of Derry than it does an actual lived in world. Multiple CGI scares that were based solely on startling you without any kind of tension. Acting isn't good so far.

I really hope they don't let this guy do any more Stephen King adaptations. I loved the IT miniseries and am a fan of the book. Mike Flanagan could've made this IP a masterpiece.",figurative
"Intricate, Fun.. Right from the start more going on than obvious, is only obvious about this show. Fun stuff is dual purpose: fun and diversion..

Particular first encounter of the two main characters after rampage fun in Filly, during which one after gained a brief info, and armed, starts walking towards the other, only for to quickly, another main arrives, and yet again rampage fun distracts, all moves on, specifics of the encounter to be ""forgotten"" or dismissed as ""plot convenience"" or ""plot armor"", while with more the story and character backstory, ""tells"" differently, and starts making sense down the line..

That is just one of many examples for the construct of this show, that is ""Show, Don't Tell"", where focusing on is rewarding..",literal
"TOP TIER Well, wow. Fallout show is actually great. Production value, sound and set design, acting, all top notch, very good writing too, the overall game feel is with it truly too. Lore is almost unscathed, only fewer than few little things, that more than half of, still are left ambiguous, making the show very true to the source material. Art-style is the mix of all, while FO 3 game and on, with FO 4 prevail, some FO and FO 2 is also included.

Very refreshing TV show, in a way quite different than most TV shows out there, also quite dynamic too, something is going on always, to extent that sometimes ""too much"" is going on, creating the need to join quite attention with watching, and then to notice and ""capture"" it all..",figurative
"cured my depression Before watching K-Pop: Demon Hunters, I never thought I would find myself appreciating anything related to K-pop. However, this film completely changed my perspective and made me second guess my views on K-Pop. K-Pop Demon Hunters surprised me with its incredible depth, emotional storytelling, and striking visuals, proving that sometimes, our assumptions can be completely wrong.

At its core, K-Pop: Demon Hunters is more than just an action-packed animation featuring glamorous idols. The film cleverly mixes fantasy, music, and emotional depth in a way that feels truly refreshing. The story follows a K-pop girl group who, by day, perform as global superstars, but by night, fight demons threatening humanity. This unique blend of worlds created an engaging plot that immediately drew me in, even as someone who doesn't enjoy K-pop music.

What stood out to me most was the emotional complexity of the characters. Each member of the group carried personal struggles, secrets, and moments of vulnerability that made them feel real and relatable. Their friendships, loyalty, and willingness to sacrifice for one another added so much emotional weight to the story. The film portrayed them not just as pop stars or fighters, but as young women dealing with fear, responsibility, and self-doubt - themes anyone can connect to, regardless of their music taste.

Another powerful element was the film's stunning animation. The visuals were beautifully detailed, from the high-energy concert scenes full of colorful lights and electric choreography to the dark, eerie demon battles that kept me on the edge of my seat. The contrasts between the glamorous stage life and the gritty demon-hunting missions were masterfully shown, emphasizing the duality of the characters' lives and adding depth to the film's overall atmosphere.

Music, of course, played a big role in the film. Surprisingly, I found myself completely captivated by the songs, despite my initial dislike of K-pop. The music in the film was not just for entertainment; it helped tell the story and express the characters' emotions. It felt empowering and inspiring rather than superficial. By the end of the movie, I caught myself humming along and appreciating the artistry behind it all.

The emotional impact of the film was what truly stayed with me. The moments of loss, fear, and hope were so well portrayed that I genuinely felt for the characters. Their growth, both individually and as a group, was moving and inspiring. It made me realize how much dedication and effort goes into not only performing but also supporting each other as a team, whether on stage or in battle.

* K-Pop: Demon Hunters* also challenged me to reflect on my own biases. Before watching it, I never gave K-pop a fair chance because I judged it based on surface-level impressions. This film opened my eyes to the storytelling potential and emotional power that can exist in any genre when it is treated with care and creativity. It reminded me that good stories and art can be found anywhere if we are open enough to experience them.

Overall, K-Pop: Demon Hunters was an unexpected and thrilling journey. It made me appreciate the hard work and heart that goes into K-pop, and even though I might not become a hardcore K-pop fan, I now respect it in a way I never did before. The film's beautiful animation, strong emotional core, and surprising depth combined to create an unforgettable experience.

I left the movie not just entertained but inspired, with a newfound willingness to explore things outside my comfort zone. For anyone skeptical about K-pop or hesitant to try something new, this film is the perfect reminder that sometimes, stepping into unfamiliar territory can lead to the most rewarding and eye-opening experiences.",figurative
"It's ok It's funny at times. Does not imake me laugh that much. I'm happy there's no laugh track, that's good. I hate these shows I have a laugh track and aren't funny. I'll continue to give it a try, but I'm not expecting much. At least there's no laugh track. It will pass the time while it work. It's okay, but not great. It's no Office.",literal
"US MARSHALS IN ALASKA I find it extremely interesting why so many dislike this show it has all the ingredients for a great tv show plenty of twists and turns to keep you guessing I almost thought it was a Movie when the trailer came on the production was spot on. Jason Clarke & Dom Cooper never disappoint, Hayley Bennett and the entire cast are also good!

Apple normally make high quality shows this is definitely one of them!

If you like great popcorn Action shows like 24 & the black list mixed in with a touch of US Marshals this is for you so forget the hate reviews they probably dislike Apple for there exclusivity.",literal
"The best thing about this is the realistic acting. In many ways, ""Sentimental Value"" reminds me of the exceptional Ingmar/Ingrid Bergman film ""Autumn Sonata"". Both stories feature a parent who essentially abandons their kids and who return years later expecting things to work themselves out...though years of hurt and abandonment stand in the way.

In this case, a famous director left his wife and kids in Norway long ago and he lived a high profile life back in Sweden. Now, decades later, he's back and wants his oldest daughter to star in a movie he's written and will direct. Not surprisingly, this churns up a lot of past hurts and resentments.

This is not an especially fun film to watch...and that's okay. The acting is quite good and Joachim Trier did a nice job of presenting a very realistic picture. While it's not great...it's very good and worth your time.",literal
Those days ain't gonna come back.. When you finish the show you'll never be the same..I guarantee you,literal
"Entertaining, but... Wednesday was entertaining. It's had a really cool look, as expected from Tim Burton. Jenna Ortega did a great job. I also liked the girl that played her roommate.

Parts of the story really didn't make sense and it's hard to ignore. For starters, if the sherif's deceased wife was once a hyde and all hydes look the same, wouldn't he suspect his son??? The same goes for the head mistress of the school. She knew that her former classmate was a hyde but didn't suspect the son? They just hoped the viewer ignored all of this and were easily distracted by shinny things.

Christina Ricci was terrible in it. Her big glasses and toupee were hard to look at.

Wednesday's dance wasn't as good as everyone says it was. She just twitched around and pretend her neck was broken. The original Wednesday dance from the 70's was much better.

Also, it was difficult to believe that Wednesday would develop feelings for the mumbling towney. That guy was such a terrible actor! He couldn't open his mouth to speak. I hope he's not in season 2.",literal
"If you mix Scarface, Robin Hood and maybe Tyler Durden with enough meth - you'll get a mean cocktail called 'Heisenberg' If you are among the few who haven't seen it yet: believe the hype, it really is THAT good. Breaking Bad may not depict reality the way 'Generation Kill' or 'The Wire' did - but then it's not about that, either. From an artistic point of view - performances, writing, direction, camera, music - this show is every bit as good as the other two mentioned above, but unlike those, 'Breaking Bad' just wants to entertain and therefore enjoys a lot more creative freedom.

The show plays like the daydream fantasy of any underachieving, struggling middle class family man who's had to bury all his dreams (I mean: who wouldn't want to be a meth-kingpin for a little while?), before it turns into a nightmare. One could almost say that 'Heisenberg' is Walter White's 'Tyler Durden'(for those who don't get the reference: watch 'Fight Club' - you won't regret it).

For pure entertainment value, this is simply the best show I've ever seen. Every single one of the main characters has already reached the status of a screen icon - when does that ever happen?! Most fun I've ever had watching a TV-show and an instant classic.",literal
"A Showdown Between Legends The Shadow's Edge brings together Jackie Chan and Tony Leung in a film that blends sharp action with an engaging storyline, and it does not disappoint.

The fight scenes were intense and well choreographed, each one driving the story forward rather than feeling excessive. The showdown between Jackie and Tony was especially gripping - a highlight of the film that delivered on every level.

Beyond the action, the film explored the clash between younger and older generations, both in the police and among the villains. This theme gave the story more weight and kept it from being just another action film.

The end-credit twist caught the audience by surprise and wrapped things up in a memorable way.

Jackie Chan, at 70, still commands the screen with ease, while Tony Leung brought strong presence and depth to his role.

The young casts were impressive, showcasing the new generation of action stars.

Notably, Wen Junhui also impressed, holding his own in action scenes alongside Jackie Chan, adding freshness to the cast.

Overall, The Shadow's Edge balances action and storytelling beautifully, making it a film worth watching.",literal
"The wrong direction I am not going to lie - I liked the pilot episode. Somewhat. It had a promise of something concrete, even if repetitive. It had the style, the passion. I could even stomach the miscreants, because... well, they had character, and that's rare among the modern ""message"".

However, from the first moments of Amazon's webseries - I knew something was off.

The animation style that got more smoothened and less emotional. The voice actors that are... I don't know... ""cleaned up""? The original Charlie had a sharp and naive voice. Now she's basically a HR manager. Her friend was equally vocal, and now is a low-voiced ""edgy for the sake of edgy"". Because they thought she's militant.

But all that could be tolerated and got used to. What couldn't be - are hopeless, dimwit, incessant and utterly pointless musicals. Not songs - musicals.

The original was 30 minutes long. It had... one song that I could recall, and at least it had a good narrative reason to it. Maybe there was another, but I wasn't too unimmersed to get annoyed by it.

Here... you hear stupid singing every 10 if not 5 minutes in a 20 minute episode. Is there a scene you are interested in, a scene you want to ""get""? Well, enjoy characters suddenly ""breaking character"" just to vocalize their monologue\dialogue. Maybe a few parts of these musicals here and there could be considered ""decent""... but largely I've facepalmed myself far too often and after getting fooled more than twice - I just can't keep watching this show. There isn't much to see anyway, even if I decided to just skip it like an ad. That's not how I consume content. Just like that's not how I consume food. I binge, I get immersed. I eat from a pot. Yet this show is like some fish, where you have to pick out bones and hope you don't choke. Ugh.

On top of that - I expected a Hazbin Hotel story. A story about losers failing twice. It's good comedy. I'm onboard with Alastor. People swallowed Simpsons for decades.

Instead I got.... uh... some worldbuilding edge for the sake of edge. To the point where heaven and hell have no meaning. Which means that the hotel has no meaning. Which means that... what exactly am I watching again?

I can't really dislike the show too much, though. If you have a stomach for musicals and for this much edge - the artstyle and the presentation are definitely outstanding. Better than watching some jap trash. Most of it, at least.

Maybe there's even some writing there. I haven't spotted it, but if there was an abridged version without songs - I'd probably watch the rest of it. Some critic compared it to other ""rude adult shows that tryhard to be adult"", among others mentioning BoJack Horseman. No. This isn't in the same league. It's not for analyzing serious matters. It's for entertainment only. Everything else is secondary and just for flavor.",literal
"Obviously the best sitcom!!! This is the most remarkable and hilarious workplace comedy created in this decade unarguably. I watched all the first 7 seasons inside a few days and I wondered how this show kept me so relaxed and wanting more and more from these characters as the story lines kept me hooked on the ever changing plot. The writers have marvellously twisted the flow of the show adding suspense, a little bit of drama and romance and a whole lot of insanely funny pranks, jokes and it really bond us with the characters. And something I felt unique about this show is that how we felt for Michael when he was desperate with his life although we hated him when he was a nuisance and he added something to the show that I find unexplainable.

So this is one heck of a show and I recently found that Billie eilish had watched this show 12 times! (worth it).",literal
"Eh I really thought after watching this show I was going to come back to IMDB and see a score around 6.7 or 6.8. It looks like that is not the case and by leaving a 7 star review I am going to be in the minority.

Here's why I gave it that score; it has appeal to the masses but does little to actually stand out as a piece of cinema. It does capture the many fun details I wanted to see as someone who grew up playing Fallout games, but it fails to break away from the recycled Hollywood template of making a modern day television show. The acting is subpar. Most of it is bad.

Walton Goggins and Moises Arias are fantastic. Ella Purnell can carry her weight but didn't particularly stand out. The guy who plays Maximus has a lot of work to do as an actor. Dogmeat did a great job.

Overall, this movie felt like another ""Safeway brand"" version of a show that could have been incredibly unique and badass. Some of the scenes were so cringe and hard to watch (ie: the BHOS chanting Maximus name at the end of the show).

It was great to finally watch a respectable adaptation of a game that I spent hundreds of hours playing in my youth and still cherish today.

A for the adaptation, but a C for the execution.",figurative
"A competent series Robert Taylor is exceptional here. His brooding quiet resolve and somewhat dangerous presence was lacking in the prior actor that played this rôle. It's hard to see him and not see the Sheriff of Absoroka County, Wyoming. Not sure I buy him as a store owner though.

Unlike other reviews here, I wasn't expecting to meet the Jethro Gibbs of the original series, even when the series was new 22 years ago, but I'm willing to continue watching and see where it goes.

Kyle Schmid is a standout bit of casting for Mike Franks. I've only seen 3 episodes so far. But, so far, so good. I hope there's a lot more of Robert Taylor in the series.",literal
"Aims High, But Doesn't Always Hit the Mark Set in 1930s Mississippi, Ryan Coogler's film combines vampire lore, racial drama and musical western to create an ambitious hybrid. The story serves as a metaphor for structural racism and cultural exploitation, with the blues functioning not only as a soundtrack but also as a symbol of collective resistance. Shot on 65mm and visually stunning, the film is characterised by a stylised aesthetic and dense, eerie atmospheres. However, despite a strong cast and some compelling moments, the accumulation of themes - from historical trauma to redemption and black identity - ultimately overwhelms the narrative, which becomes muddled and inconsistent. Violence and horror come too late to really make an impact, and some symbolic ideas, like the ""inclusive"" white vampires or the presence of the Choctaws, feel underdeveloped. Coogler aims high, but doesn't always hit the mark: the film stands out more for what it hints at than what it has to say. The result is a bold but uneven work that favors discourse rather than suspense and focuses more on thesis than emotional resonance.",figurative
Great show Love this show it just goes by to fast! You start watching and it's over. Can't wait for next year.,literal
"Just Okay! This film is an okay action piece, but it is not particularly memorable. It is the standard Liam Neeson feature, which could have benefitted from a more developed ending.

I would not say there is any spectacular filmmaking or editing on show. The fight scenes were well displayed and fast paced. Additionally, the film's antagonists were quite threatening. Usually an action film like this does not really give much presence to antagonist characters and just has them as cannon fodder. The main antagonist is effectively intimidating and is probably the most memorable part of the film.

There was quite a few plot threads that were left up in the air after the film ended. It seems like the film was cut short or some content was taken out. This does not ruin the film, but I wish the ending did not end so abruptly. Overall, it is an okay watch if you are looking for a action flick!",literal
"Shockingly evil show! I don't know what to think now. People who I did consider serious actors agreeing to be in the most disgusting, pathetic depiction of women I have ever seen. This tells me everyone in this show is desperate for work and will agree to anything just for the pay cheque.. Alls Fair is a ridiculously written show about a group of female lawyers who despise men, have zero ethics and respect for the law whose aim is to manipulate women and steal as much money from wealthy men as possible no matter what laws they break or what the situation is.. as long as they get their cut of the proceeds.

The premise of the show being female lawyers who fight for women who marry extremely wealthy men clearly for the money.. who have signed prenups hire these female lawyers to blackmail the husband so they can steal as much money as possible form the wealthy husband..even when the split up was the wives fault.. usually cheating.. The dialogue, acting and storyline is all abysmal and an insult to every thinking woman.. These annoying women might be a parody of the worst of the worst and I am missing the underlying message.. Maybe this show is written to show the most evil nasty manipulative shallow disgusting people with zero redeeming qualities.. so we feel good about ourselves.. I must add having Kim Kardashian in the show doesn't detract from the other actors with her awful acting because I don't think any of them are really trying to shine or give the show everything they have because they all suck.. or again I'm missing their appalling acting efforts to make Kardashian feel better about her shockingly bad acting .. maybe they are being kind to her.. I just don't understand how this show ever made it to the production stage.. didn't anyone notice how disgusting it was..",figurative
"Disappointed with Season2 Season 1 worked very well, but the much anticipated Season 2 has struggled with poor performances and a very weak storyline all around. I expected far more from Tim Buton and his crew! The cameo performances do nothing to enhance anything and are usually a sign of the producers need them to make up for the lack of the very weak storyline. Even Jenny Ortega is far less believable, and seems to lack conviction in Season 2. By far the best performing of all the cast is Luis Guzmán as Gomez. Comparing his performance back to the original Addams Family TV series, he is doing extremely well and captures Gomez perfectly. Catherine Zeta Jones as Morticia is also a pretty good match compared to Carolyn Jones.",literal

I'm glad to say that it lived up the hype. This is Lindsay Lohan's big comeback and she absolutely shines in this role. She's amazing at physical comedy and has the comedic chops to pull it off. Jamie Lee Curtis herself is like a big kid and she seamlessly plays the role of Tess and Lily.

"Decent on its own, BURIED by the 1990 miniseries What a weird, weird, weird movie! Here's a series of unordered considerations. 1) Moving the setting 30 years forward from the late '50s to the late '80s was a good choice: most fitting music, clothes and generally a best ambiance for the whole story. 2) NOT ENOUGH HENRY BOWERS! He's supposed to be a literal human devil, an oppressing tormenter... but what we got here is an edgy kid with a hair. 3) Why does everything looks so cheap and fake? How is it possible to have a 2017 movie with WORSE special effects than a 1990 miniseries? Worst offender is obviously the CGI department, with some parts being more suitable to some indie videogame's cutscene than a 35 million dollars Hollywood production. 4) Storytelling calls another comparison between this movie and the 1990 miniseries, and the movie loses again (deeply). There's no match: this is a series of scenes attached together, more than an actual movie; and this feels very wrong given the fact that the original material - one of the best novels from King - manages to build a unique and coherent narration even if it's divided into many different chapters, settings and time periods. This movie is just... things happening after other things, followed by other things already reasy to leave space for another set of things. It's generally enjoyable but it's also... unthrilling. It's like they were too busy following online tutorials for Adobe After Effects to care about giving the script a soul.",literal
"Massively Overhyped This show is boring. Concept interesting but just the fact that it's rated so highly is baffling. Main character is annoyingly angry, makes it a hard watch.

"It is getting a bit too much Don't get me wrong, I love the show until season 16. I am also an extremely left leaning European but the lessons in each episode are too in your face. People are not dumb. Not every injury must be tied to some lesson etc. Plus it's extremely hypocritical that they're still celebrating people in the army as if they are heroes when in reality they're just pawns infiltrating countries that literally don't need them there.

I'd love to see some episodes go back to the old style of giving life lessons etc.

I am not opposed to some wokeness but it needs to be toned down and done in a bit of a smarter way.",literal
"Eddington fully realized 2025 seems to be the year of high concept epics about fighting the establishment, appropriate given the controversy. While July's Eddington went straight for the jugular and pulled no punches, Paul Thomas Anderson's newest film tries and succeeds in balancing it with genuine heart and a good sense of humor. The latter in particular goes hand in hand with the drama and action, achieving a perfect balance. Some of the stuff, like Leonardo DiCaprio struggling with codes and getting increasingly agitated, is some of the funniest this year. And the social commentary, while a little blunt, isn't infuriatingly obvious like Eddington.

A lot of actors today don't appear to let age slow them down, especially those who specialize in big budget films. DiCaprio is one such actor, as spry in his 50s as he was in his 20s. He's as passionate and fun as ever, and he perfectly handles both the dramatic and comedic moments. Sean Penn meanwhile makes for a phenomenal antagonist, representing everything our hero hates and being as slimy, creepy, and quietly menacing as needed. Benicio Del Toro isn't in a lot of the film, but still makes the best of his limited screentime. Chase Infiniti is great as DiCaprio's daughter. And the rest of the cast is excellent, too.

Anderson's films tend to feel as long as they are, for better or worse. This film does too, but unlike some of his other films, it's never boring. It's spectacularly structured and paced, and Anderson's directing, full of his signature long shots and sharp edits, help with many of the more breakneck set pieces. The climax in particular is one of the most heart-stopping finales in recent years; I was genuinely on the edge of my seat with concern the whole time. The music is stellar, too.

Overall, One Battle After Another is, at least at this moment, possibly my favorite film of the year. It might also be my favorite Anderson film; I'd have to watch There Will Be Blood again.",literal
"Wildly, Absolutely, and Unapologetically ""Shameless"" on All Four Cylinders Wildly, Absolutely, and Unapologetically ""Shameless""

I always become furious watching ""relevant"" TV these days. Glee, Vampire Diaries, Jersey Shore its' all crap to me. I don't care about your Drama/ Music club, I don't want to know how brooding, love sick vampires get girlfriends, and I definitely don't care about how many STD's Snooki has gotten over the past several years. 

Look at where we all are, we are in a recession, schools and public works maintenance funding is in the tank, rich get richer, poor die young young, the public representation in government is nearly zip, and etc. So why is popular TV ""sunshine and rainbows"", fake, expensive tans, and rich white kids (with some of other ethnicity to have some scope in minority television ratings) singing? 

Here's the deal

I don't enjoy High School, I hate Twilight, and I don't like to date stupid alcoholics. I want a show about life, ""real life"", as it is for the majority of this now crazy and defunct America. I wanted Shameless.

Shameless is SHOTIME original drama series that centers on the dysfunctional family of single father, dead beat, and alcoholic Frank Gallagher, played by Oscar Nominee William H. Macy. While at first glance the Gallagher's everyday grind of trying to get through the day living below the poverty line in Chicago may come across as just another crass, American, and unrated, comedy series. And it is. Frank and his kin are constantly landing themselves in crazy ""stranger than fiction"" circumstances which are an absolute thrill to view. From scamming thugs to pay bills to shooting yourself in the hand with a nail gun to keep getting disability checks, the Gallagher's know how to party.

At the same time though, the comedy is also a great false pretense that I works very well in the show's favor. As soon you become hooked to the offbeat and racy humor you very soon start to see the very real stories that the actors flawlessly bring to the small screen with their performances. 

Lip(Jeremy Allen White), the oldest son in the Gallagher family, is a certifiable genius but is at odds with whether or not he is content living the way he has and could more than likely end up like his loser father, Frank. The other biggest plot line is that of Fiona(Emmy Rossum), the eldest daughter, who has to choose between her own happiness or keeping up with her supposed obligations to provide for her family since their mother ran out on them several years ago. And while the Gallagher's are a dysfunctional family, it's easy to sometimes watch in awe as they are able to still pull together at the end of the day, despite everything, and enjoy life.

This show may turn some off though, that is expected. We all enjoy different spectrums of life that we make ourselves want to believe in. But as for those of us living in this country and finding ourselves not quite getting sucked in by Glee or whatever, this is a godsend. People like us want what is real, what is willing to show us the grittiness of society. But show all of it, the good and bad. Not all of us can drive Beetles or Hummers and go drinking on the boats our parents buy us. Some of us have to worry about real life right now, probably more than we care to admit. And that's what Shameless is about, being more real than we care to admit. 

The first season is now on DVD and BluRay, and the show's second season is now on TV, pulling no punches as expected. It looks like my winter/spring is going to be one well spent with the Gallagher family. Although, I think I might tune in once or twice to Jersey Shore to watch Snooki drunkenly run head first into a wall.",literal
"On what planet did someone rate this a 10? I can't even trust these reviews now. This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. I cannot believe the caliber of movies that are available and this is by no means one you should pay to see ever. I really like Dakota Johnson, unfortunately her and the leading man and everyone in this movie was so poorly acted. It's just absolutely Not believable at all. We walked out of the movie before it was half done. It was so bad. The awkward pauses, the effort it was taking to believe any of these people were attracted to each other. The idea of the story isn't terrible but everything else about this was just awful. If you wanna see it don't pay for it.",literal
"I like this Poldark, but something is missing..... I was a fan of the 1975+ series & of the books. I like this series well enough to look forward to each week's episode. However, compared to the Robin Ellis version I find Aiden Turner's Ross a bit heavy & morose. He doesn't laugh enough. This Ross takes himself far more seriously than Robin Ellis' Ross or the Ross of the books. That Ross was a ""good guy"" but not someone ready for the French Revolution. Demelza was a little spit fire. This Demelza is quiet & subdued. In the 1975 version one saw that Ross' humor had to fall in love with Demelza's puckish spirit & vice versa. I'm not sure why this Ross fell for this Demelza. My main issue with this version & why I gave it a 7 is that the story telling feels rushed. I almost feel like we are getting the Cliff's Notes version rather than the novels. The 1975 version was well paced and gave us time to understand who was who + what & why was things were happening. I'm still not quite sure who is who beyond Ross, Demelza, Elizabeth, Francis & Verity. I'm a costumer & the history stickler in me has to point out that this story should have started in 1782 at the latest. The costumes are erratic.... some are fine, but others belong more in the 1790s. Had I been the costume designer, I'd have gone more for costumes that were a bit old-fashioned looking for the period... ca 1760s-1770s, rather than fashion forward, because Cornwall was remote & not an extremely wealthy part of the UK (too much boom & bust). Even the gentry of the area would only have had access to the latest fashions when they went to London, which would have probably only been once a year. Women's gowns & men's coats & waistcoats would have been a little behind the times & often remade to try to make them look more currently fashionable.",figurative
"Boring already This is getting stale and repetitive very fast. The third episode was a bore. The ratings are doing to drop pretty soon when the emperor's new clothes situation fizzles out.

This show's stakes feel ridiculously high and non-existent at the same time. Humanity is gone as we know it and all we see is a woman dealing with it, angrily. How could this possibly be interesting if there is no adversary? No interaction with real characters?

All the 11 people that hadn't been changed accepted this insane change in 2 days. No fear, no doubts, no anger their loved ones are no longer themselves, nothing. That seems beyond ridiculous and unrealistic to me. Imagine how would you feel if that happened. These 11 people were acting more like puppets than the actual puppets.

Vinxe Gilligan said ""I was thinking of every science fiction trope and horror-movie trope I could throw into this show, and then turn all of those tropes onto their head,""

Maybe the ""tropes"" are there for a reason.",literal
"Blunt edged adaptation wastes the potential of a  great  novella Warning - contains broad spoilers of the ""Running Man"" movie AND book, along with general spoilers of ""The Natural"" and the original ""Rollerball"". -------------------------------------------------------

I had my doubts when I learned that Arnold would be the lead for an adaptation of Richard Bachman/Stephen King's grim little dystopian novella, ""The Running Man"". And it's pretty obvious that most of the commentators here never read the original book, because for all the merits of the movie's supposed social satire and prophetic outlook, it's a Disney version of ""Bachman's"" mean, bitter outlook and ferocious plotting. At the very least, the film has a ""happy"" ending with Arnie's character not only overcoming all his foes but starting a social revolution a-la Norman Jewison's ""Rollerball"". The book ends with the beleaguered, dying hero crashing his stolen plane into Killian's building (talk about ""prophetic""! ), killing them both in a purely feral take-you-to-hell-with-me spasm of anger and defiance. 

So the movie may have gotten some of the surface trappings right, but it misses the real point and mood of the original story. Of course, the same miss-the-point-by-changing-the-ending problem holds true of Redford's role in the movie adaptation of ""The Natural"", and everyone seems to agree that ""Natural"" was a fine cinematic experience.

I'll go along with that. It's a typical Schwarzenegger movie, with the usual one liners and tag lines, gun play and punch-outs, as well as the the usual homo-erotic muscle guy stuff. The movie was obviously done on the cheap, but energetic pacing and direction pulls it off. It's the typical larger-than-life role that Arnold does very well, without ever needing to do more than to be himself on camera.

""Running Man"" misses the mark in several spots near the end. It tries to cram in a whole bunch of contrived events to make things come out as a happy ending...and it's pretty obvious that the ending only works because the Arnold is the hero, and heroes are supposed to win. The whole scenario where ""Kimball"" and company reverse the effects of decades of propaganda with ONE 30 second ""counter broadcast"" is wishful thinking of the purest kind. Also the walk-ons by Mick Fleetwood and Dweezil Zappa are god-awful enough to make me grateful that real actors, even 2nd rate ""B"" movie and TV actors, actually work hard to master the basics of their craft so they don't stink up the celluloid they appear on like Mick and Dweezil do. (I'm not saying either of them are bad people, mind you...their roles were obviously just done for a lark.) 

But I did end up liking this better than ""Raw Deal"" (the previous Arnold film) because it did a better job of emphasizing and showcasing the outsized elements of Arnold's screen presence.

There's no justifying a movie like ""Running Man"" as anything but escapist action and trashy entertainment. There's nothing wrong with that, though. And if you're going to build your movie around car chases, you might as well have the hero drive a Hummer through a plate glass window while firing an assault rifles out the door and punching his passenger in the jaw. ""Running Man"" justifies itself by getting right to the Hummer and the punching, if you know what I mean.",figurative
"Life-Changing Series Criminal Minds is the most inspirational and life-changing show I have ever watched. It has changed my life in so many ways and brought me so much inspiration and joy from watching it.

The characters and actors are absolutely phenomenal, and there are no words other than to say watch this show, and you won't regret it.",literal
"A Cool Show....Very Cool. I have seen several ""cop-based"" shows from ""Hillstreet Blues(no I'm not that old;just twenty-eight here...saw the reruns) to ""The Sentinel"" from UPN, but this show was somewhat different. I mean it has the usual victim/criminal/cop element, but it also has what some of the other shows have....humor. I mean, Toney Denoso(something like that..anyway) is a riot and Abby is really cool. Even Mark Harmon's character of Gibbs is his moments. It doesn't have the s/f/x that CSI has and it may not have big-breasted drop-dead gorgeous women like some of these prime-time dramas may have-though Sasha Alexander comes very close to hot....for a cop-but those things don't really make good TV watching anyway. So give the show a try, you won't be disappointed.

"Teenager's perspective on coming of age I want to see this movie because one reviewer said the movie was so awful. It was worth watching and I went and watched it because of that the movie is worth watching and it helps if you're older than the young woman in the movie and I'm retired so I'm definitely older.

The movie can only be described as a teenage woman's coming of age inevitableconflicts with her parents and big emotional issues. And the main character characters perspective is of everything that's happening in her life, even though she's not present to witness it . Its as if you're watching every scene in the movie through the eyes of that teenager even though she may not be in the same. And if I said any details about what happened in the movie, it would spoil the movie so it's about a teenager, her parents, her friends and her brand new boyfriend that tells you the characters it doesn't tell you the story that's all you need to know go watch it.

For that reason, I give it an A+",literal
"10/10 for Henry Cavill, 6/10 for everything else Pretty much only kept watching for Cavill and Jaskier. They both did an amazing job, especially Cavill as the Witcher, his scenes and acting were perfect. Its too bad he was surprisingly only in about third of the scenes. Found myself bored with scenes without him and just wanting to skip ahead. Many of the other characters lacked charm and interesting sub plots and felt they had too much attention paid to them and that they were overall lacklustre. Would have liked more attention paid to Cavill and monster hunting. Really disappointed that Henry will not continue with the show since he single-handedly made it worthwhile to watch. Here's hoping the new actor can do the role justice.",literal
"Highly watchable garbage Great cast. Great production values across the board. Great pacing. Unfortunately the plot can barely be called one. Internal logic is completely missing. Character actions and reactions are over the top or vastly inappropriate. I like action as much as the next guy, but the violence level is rediculous. And of course, there are the oblitory woke lectures jammed in to meet requirements.",figurative
"A great show once, an embarrassment now. The Big Bang Theory started off as a unique, captivating sitcom especially for nerds like me who cherished the jokes on interference pattern, quantum theory or be it the limbic system. The show kept its qualities intact, its jokes at par and the acting believable.

Fast forward a few seasons (around season 7, if I recall correctly) and it became a regressive, boring sitcom where the actors seem uninterested, the jokes non-existent. It makes me wonder if there are even writers for this show. The current season is as dreadful as the last season and will make you realize the importance of the time you just wasted watching it.

Watching an episode of the initial seasons and the current season/last season is comparable to hearing Adele and Rebecca Black sing.",literal
"pretty good if you haven't seen the original If I had never watched the brilliant, hilarious, charming British TV series Ghosts I probably would watch a few more episodes of this American version. It's cute, it's somewhat funny, it's an interesting premise.

But it is also inferior in every way to the original. The living couple protagonists are so much more charming, the jokes are so much funnier, the pacing is so much sharper.

The ghosts are a mix of copies the English originals (pantless politician, arrow-through-the-neck scout leader) and ghosts unique to this version (hippy chick, flapper) and I feel they might have been better off taking the idea but creating all original ghosts, simply to make it less like a pale shadow of the original.

No reason not to watch this, but definitely check out the British version. It's amazing.",literal
"A mess of a movie, with some good moments Even though it does have a narrative through line, I thought Superman is a mess. I just don't think James Gunn's surrealistic touches mesh with this character. It works best when it feels organically wacky, which is not often. Otherwise, it feels overstuffed and too cartoony. I get that that is the intention, but I'm not a 12 year old boy, which is clearly the target audience.

Probably the worst mistake of the finished movie is that so little time is spent outside of any superheroics, giving little importance to anything that feels emotionally authentic in human relationships, especially the pivotal one of Superman/Clark Kent and Lois Lane. It's hard to say whether Rachel Brosnahan was was simply not given enough to work with here as a character, or if she is simply miscast in the role. Whatever the explanation is, she nevertheless comes off as the least distinctive of any of the characters, and with how the role exist in the movie, anyone else could have been cast and had the same effect.

Nicholas Hoult has some decent moments, but most of the time he's just shouting off numbers. I get that he is playing an Elon Musk-type person, but because of the little he's actually given to do physically in the movie (he's just the evil mastermind in a tower pretty much the entire time), it feels like it's another character that's completely interchangeable with any other similar villain archetype, and that there's no justification for having lex luthor be in the movie other than to just have it being Lex Luthor.

Overall, unfortunately I found the movie pretty inane and disposable, despite the efforts of all the hard-working people involved in making it.

SPOILER ALERT: It did get me really excited for Supergirl, though, who shows up for a minute at the last minute and is the best thing about the whole movie.",literal
"Fantastic Four Brings the Spark Back in Brilliant Style Fantastic Four is nothing short of a triumphant return, a movie that reclaims the heart and soul of what makes Marvel movies truly magical. Watching this film felt like rediscovering the excitement and wonder that made me fall in love with the MCU in the first place. It's bold, fresh, and emotionally resonant, with a perfect mix of thrilling action, compelling characters, and humor that lands without feeling forced.

One thing I have to address head-on is the ongoing narrative that ""Marvel is dead."" Honestly, that's just not true. Marvel was never dead - the franchise has always been evolving, experimenting, and sometimes taking hits, but it never lost its core magic. A lot of the backlash against recent Marvel movies feels less about the movies themselves and more about viewers' preconceived notions or agendas. Too often, films get hated before they even hit theaters, fueled by internet chatter and skepticism.

Take Shang-Chi or Eternals - both had their share of early hate and skepticism, but as time went on, audiences warmed up, and many came to appreciate what these films brought to the MCU. The shifting opinions showed how much people's reception can be influenced by outside factors rather than the actual quality of the films. Fantastic Four stands tall against this trend. It isn't just good in spite of the noise; it's good because it understands what the audience wants - genuine storytelling wrapped in spectacle.

The cast delivers spectacular performances, especially the chemistry between the team. Their dynamics feel authentic, and the writing gives each character moments to shine, balancing their powers with personality and vulnerability. The visuals are stunning without overwhelming the story - the CGI is polished, immersive, and serves to heighten the emotional stakes rather than distract from them.

The movie's pacing is solid, keeping you engaged from start to finish without unnecessary filler. And while the plot touches on familiar superhero tropes, it does so with a fresh perspective and clever twists that keep it unpredictable and exciting.

If you're someone who's been skeptical of Marvel lately, I encourage you to give Fantastic Four a chance without the noise and hype clouding your expectations. This film proves that Marvel can still deliver blockbuster entertainment that resonates deeply.

Overall, I'm giving Fantastic Four a 9 out of 10 because it brings back the spark that reminded me why Marvel movies have been a cultural phenomenon for over a decade. It's a film made for fans and newcomers alike, a joyous celebration of heroism, heart, and adventure.

Marvel wasn't dead before, and with this movie, it sure isn't dying anytime soon.",figurative
"The best thriller since Big Little Lies Standing ovation!!! All Her Fault is absolutely a binge-watch-and it's totally worth every minute.

The writing is excellent, the pacing is razor-sharp, and the editing is exquisite. There's a hook at the end of every episode, and the season finale cleverly circles back to the last scene of ep 1. No wonder people end up finishing the whole season in one sitting.

The story starts with a missing boy, but what unfolds is a layered look at the humanity-and the flaws-within the families involved. Meressa's final move against Peter? BRILLIANT. It let me recall Big Little Lies soooo much. And yeah, last time I saw this level of brilliance is hands down BLL. And seeing Snook and Fanning sitting together safely with their kids in the end. Perfect.

But let's talk about the husbands. The way they kept asking their wives: ""Why didn't you...?"" or ""You should have...,"" when shit happens, was so ridiculous. Why weren't they asking themselves those questions first? That's why I practically cheered when Jenny said, ""I want a divorce,"" to her useless husband. Pure relief.

And by ""All her fault""? The writers actually meant All his fault.

A sharp, gripping thriller with unforgettable performances-and a finale that sticks the landing.",literal
"I never even giggled I wish we could communicate somehow with other reviewers so I could ask them exactly what scene made them laugh. This is a Lifetime, 80s after school special, or maybe a 70s Disney plot and message. Its so incredibly simplistic and insulting to my intelligence. But obviously not to the general public who are rating this anything higher than a 5 out of 10. It actually confirms what I already knew. That the masses are below average intelligence. The movie, I wont call it a film, is talking to the audience as if they are a bunch of children teaching us a lesson about empathy, how life isn't always fair, and spewing the Hollywood leftist. Funny thing is Keanus character complains about taxes and how difficult it is but Hollywood are the same ones that want to tax the hell.out of the hard working people and redistrute it and enable people are are just sucking off the teet and contributing nothing. The US is still a.place that if you work hard, and take.some chances anyone can still make it out of poverty. I cant comprehend how anyone over the age of 9 years could have found this entertaining. Its embarrassing.",literal
"A 2000s dramedy with a modern twist and a brilliant McKenna Grace. What could have been just another generic adaptation of Colleen Hoover's novel becomes a film with its own identity, supported by good performances and confident direction. Mckenna Grace is the standout, delivering a magnetic performance that elevates the material and makes the audience connect with her journey.

Regretting You is, above all, a film about new beginnings. Even if it doesn't explore the full depth of its drama, it wins you over with its emotional honesty and the way it transforms pain into learning. It's a romance that moves, entertains, and proves that sometimes lightness can be as powerful as suffering.",figurative
"A Nice and interesting plot This one is a Nice and interesting thriller. Good to see Castle girl back. The way the plot unfolds is really nice. Kudos to the screenplay & writers. Along with the mystery this has a great human element... how Emily reacts to the current world where she lost her family, job and everything as well as How the world including her son, husband( his new wife) and FBI reacts to Emily's return.

This series has everything a complete package crime, mystery, serial killer and Drama.

Only thing I didn't like the Camera work. Noticed many time they use unnecessary darkness , Seams they used handle cam as well.

"A Masterclass in How Not to Make Television Whatever could go wrong with a show, Sheriff Country manages to do flawlessly. The writing feels like someone spent an afternoon prompting ChatGPT and went with the first draft.

The cast? Every single one is overacting like they're trying to win an award no one's giving. It's the kind of performance you see when an actor isn't actually living the role-just imitating what they think acting looks like.

Directing... if it's happening, I couldn't tell. The whole thing is built from platitudes and clichés, but even the cookie-cutter approach would've been an upgrade. Somehow this is worse.

I forced myself through the first two episodes. That was enough. I won't waste more time on this level of lameness. Some shows take a few episodes to find their rhythm-this one never even tuned the instrument.

"Back to the eighties! Netflix did it again with Stranger Things. It's a very pleasant and easy to follow series to watch. It's like a time warp back to the eighties. A mixture of The Goonies meets The X-Files meets Close Encounters Of A Third Kind. I watched the whole first season in just a couple days. You immediately get hooked on this show. I don't know if the makers will add another season to it and if they do I'm already very curious what it will be about. Will it be a complete other story or will it just continue where the first season ended? It doesn't matter to me, I just want more seasons like this one. The cast is very good. All the actors fit perfectly well in the story. There is enough suspense to keep you interesting all the time. Watch this one, you won't regret it.",literal
"It: Not as bad as I expected, not as good as they say Remakes/reboots are a plenty at the moment and I'm ""That"" guy who gets angry whenever a new one is announced and It was no exception so naturally I went in expecting the worst.

Some remakes are direct scene for scene while others take the concept but go into business for themselves. It does a combination and for the most part it works.

With a solid Stand By Me (1986) vibe and turning the tale into a two parter we see the Losers club battle Pennywise The Clown and it turned over a nice profit at the box office and was met with critical acclaim. 

I as expected do not understand the hype and am certainly not onboard but even I can't dispute that there are some real successes here.

It looks great, its well written and the young cast do a brilliant job. As for Bill Skarsgård I have to say, meh. It's not that he did a bad job, he's just performing in the shadow of someone better.

I'm a Stephen King fanboy at heart and I love both his works and most of the movie adaptations so I'm happy to see that this isn't a black mark on his record but do not want to see anymore remade.

Credit where credit is due, this is a well made feature but flawed in places and simply shouldn't have been made in the first place.

The Good: 

Looks great

The Bad:

Yet another unneeded remake

"First season was terrific, season 2 not so much The only reason I give this show 6 stars was season one was at least 8. Season 2 is a disappointment so far. It's definitely a 4 or a 5 star season. Jeremy Renner plays Mike McClusky some kind of ""Fixer"" in a blue collar town that is known for the many prisons they have. Renner is the unofficial Mayor of Kingstown. But I still don't know what it is he does other than run around, talk to people, get phone calls all day, seeing his brother, seeing his cop friends, seeing his mother, seeing a black Crip leader, seeing some white supremacist, seeing some Russian mobster. That's what he does, see people. Making deals.

Season 2 is a mess. Season one was pretty good, but once again, I really don't know what season 2 is about.",literal
"A big fan of the show NCIS had been on TV a while when I got into the series. I used to see it while flicking through the channels, I quickly flicked over to another channel, just because I didn't think I'd like it but one night when there wasn't much of the TV, I had no choice but to watch it and as soon as the episode finished, I was so blown away by it and I have been engrossed it in ever since.

Being in the UK, I had never heard of NCIS so I didn't know what it stood for and as I watched the show I found my knowledge of the organisation growing the longer I watched it.

This show works on so many great levels. Number one is the actors, I just love the way they interact with each other, they are like a family and act like one too. Mark Harmon plays Leroy Jethro Gibbs (what a stroke of genius, giving him that name), he is a former gunnery sergeant who is the boss of a group of investigators. He is the father, who can be strict and unbending but he clearly cares for his team and goes to bat for them when they are in trouble. Lauren Holly plays the director of NCIS (Jenny Shepard) who has a past with Gibbs and they act like a married couple at times, arguing about cases. I do like the relationship between Gibbs and Tony, I always laugh when Tony says the wrong thing and gets a slap across the back of the head, that has me in fits of hysterics as the situation is never sent up in the same way. Michael Weatherly (Anthony DiNozzo), he used to be a former homicide detective before he joined NCIS. He is like a small boy who has never grown up, he is into his movies, he loves the women and likes to make fun of McGee, much to McGee's annoyance. McGee (Sean Murray) is the probie who is a MIT graduate and a whizz with computers. He is like the little brother who wants to be so much like Tony and yet at times not so such. Pauley Perrette (Abby Sciuto) is the goth forensics specialist who is the fun and exciting sister that mothers warn their sons about. Cote de Pablo (Ziva David) is a former Moussad agent, she is the big sister who everyone is wary of. She is just as wary of forming attachments as she has lost a lot of people in her life and she can defend herself which seems to bond her with Gibbs. She if finding it hard to adjust to a different environment that she is not used to. Finally, there is the brilliant David McCallum who plays Donald 'Ducky' Mallard, he is the medical examiner. He is a kind grandfather who the others go to for advice. One of the best things about Ducky is he likes to stray from a subject into his many entertaining stories. I sometimes wish Gibbs would let him tell us the end of the stories as they sound truly fascinating.

I like that NCIS investigates a wide range of crimes involving the Navy and Marines such as murder, espionage, terrorism. It is interesting to see the different procedures, the Naval Criminal Investigative Service has compared to the police.

This series is not just one type of genre, it has many layers to it. There is comedy, drama, action, tension, twists and turns in one programme. The writing just manages to show it all in a good way and the writers are able to switch between the genres to carry the plot along. They clearly have good advisers because the episodes are sensibly concluded and there is never any thought that this wouldn't happen in real life.

It is created by Donald P. Bellisario who brought the world Jag, Quantum Leap, Airwolf, Magnum P.I who seems interested in Military themes as this features in his shows in some form or another.

I do hope there are more seasons of this programme to come because now I am really hooked and it has become another of my favourite shows on TV.",figurative
"This is what i wanted Longlegs to be more like... I liked Creggers' Barbarian a lot, but he didn't entirely stick the landing for me. Weapons is his sophomore effort, and you can see the confidence in direction and story telling is more refined.

Its gonna be hard to choose between this and 'Bring her Back', as my fave horror of the year thus far...",literal
"Good Acting Unfortunately the acting couldn't carry this stinker. I don't know where to start. There's a lot.

The production quality was less than mediocre. Poor quality digital effects such as numerous cheesy nighttime outdoor skies in scenes obviously done on a set. Tons of instances of things not being period correct. There were dialogue issues; like when the car salesman bragged about the 7.2 liter engine in an Olds 442; or the home decor (interior paint colors for instance) that was more 21st century than early '70's.

The expectations regarding suspension of disbelief were a bit much as well. The story would have been better and a lot more plausible without the cliche native American paranormal hooey.

I also found it funny that people working hard outdoors in the desert had spotlessly clean clothes. No dirt and dust. No enormous sweat and/or salt stains. The cars were also much too clean for having just been driven on dirt roads in the desert.

The basic plot and story arc without the paranormal crap had potential. It's too bad about the sub-par writing and the lack of production quality.",literal
"a surprisingly light and fun watch I didn't think I would like this show at all, but I'm really enjoying it. Don't let the negative reviews deter you, try it out and form your own opinion. It's one of those shows that you don't need to take super seriously, it's just a chill and fun watch. If you liked Psych or Pokerface, you'll like this. Morgan reminds me a lot of Shawn from Psych, in that she's keenly observant but chaotic, and does the detectives job better than they do. A lot of her ""aha"" moments remind me of Psych as well. The supporting characters are mostly likeable, though Karadec can be annoying. Morgan can definitely be annoying too, which I could see being a turnoff for some people. But she clearly has a big heart, and cares a great deal about justice. Some of the crimes and solves are definitely improbable, but it's fiction. I think people need to lighten up in their criticism of comedies, because at the end of the day this has been an enjoyable watch.",literal
"Murder In A Small Town ""Murder in a Small Town"" is a gripping, atmospheric series that draws you in with its blend of mystery, suspense, and small-town drama. The storytelling is tight and layered, keeping you guessing while also giving depth to the characters and the community they live in. What makes it even more compelling is the outstanding performance by Rossif Sutherland - son of Donald Sutherland and half-brother of Kiefer Sutherland - who brings both intensity and vulnerability to the lead role. It's refreshing to see a crime drama that balances dark intrigue with genuine heart. Definitely worth watching if you enjoy character-driven mysteries with a cinematic feel.",literal
"Welcome to the Xander zone I remember in high school a lot of students were talking about this movie xXx. Staring Vin Diesel, Samuel L Jackson, Asia Argento, among others.

Then again it wasn't set up to be that way but still don't think I'm bashing the film no sir no ma'am I'm not. 

I enjoy the film it just has been so long until a few months ago that I just watch it again to see how it holds up today.

The story of the film features Vin Diesel plays Xander Cage an Adrenaline junkie who ends up getting the attention of Agent Augustus Gibbons of the NSA who recruits Cage for a job to become a spy for him.

The Soundtrack of the film has a mix of metal and hip hop songs featuring Gavin Rossdale, Drowning Pool,Nelly, N.E.R.D., Queen of the Stone Age and much more. 

The theme of the film is ""Adrenaline"" by Gavin Rossdale which in it own right match the film and the character of Xander Cage so good job by the music department to pick this song as the film theme.

What is the driving factor of the film is the action and stunts are pretty much out of this world. Some stunts almost think that was impossible for them to pull it off. But sure enough it was very well done which is enough to keep your interest. 

Some of the cast could have been do with out but Vin did well as the anti hero of the film since he wasn't intend to being in the mess in the first place but he was in it non the less.

Some of the characters could have been better off not making it onto the film but what can you say about it but still I found the film to be enjoyable.

With great stunts, tight soundtrack it's enough to enjoy the film

I give xXx an 8 out of 10",literal
"Really enjoyed the first season! ""Wednesday"" is a refreshing remake of the original series that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats with its interesting story and great acting. Jenna Ortega shines in her role, bringing depth and emotion to the character. The show is filled with suspenseful moments that will leave you guessing what will happen next, and there are also plenty of funny moments to lighten the mood. The mystery surrounding the storyline adds an extra layer of intrigue, keeping audiences hooked until the very end. Overall, ""Wednesday"" is a must-watch for fans of the original series and newcomers alike, offering a modern take on a classic story with all the thrills and excitement you could ask for.",figurative
"entertaining while you watch, but dumb when you really think about it. Now you see me, is a story about 4 magicians who are brought together by an unknown entity to do the best and biggest trick the world has ever seen. Involving a series of robin hood style ""rob the rich give to the poor"" tricks. And while it's a nice concept and starts off nice, hell even clever, it becomes entangled in it's own web of trying to make you feel stupid, or maybe make itself look smart?

The direction(by Louis Leterrier) is surprisingly good albeit shaky cam is a bit overused on the action sequences(oh god i hate shaky cam), but the magic tricks and all the quirks that come with it are very well done, and make you feel like part of them.

The acting is uneven to say the least. Jesse Eisenberg and Dave Franco play themselves very convincingly, Isla Fisher is basically playing a bland character with zero personality (mainly due to the writing to which ill get in a second). However Woody Harrelson, Mark Ruffalo and Mélanie Laurent manage to make what little they have to work with pretty good. Michael Caine is pretty much wasted here, and Morgan Freeman unfortunately has nothing to work with thanks to the script(i'm pretty sure they only hired him to narrate the exposition scenes). which brings me to my next part.

The writing. Oh god the writing, it appears that the writers were so busy coming up with forced twists and complicated plots that they forgot about writing actual characters in the movie, every character is so generic and bland that it's not even funny. Yeah thats the guy who's annoying and cocky but we still love him, thats the guy that tries to be the annoying and cocky guy but isn't, thats the girl character, yeah basically thats it, she doesn't need a personality she's a girl! the only character that had even the slightest bit of depth was Woody Harrelson's and maybe Melanie Laurents but if i had to be completely honest i'd credit that to Harrelson's acting and not the writing. I mean there were apparently 5 guys that have writing credits, couldn't they have added at least a LITTLE character development instead of another stupid exposition scene? Oh that's another thing, i know this movie is supposed to be about showing us how the tricks work, but man do they spoon feed it to us, they could do it in so much less time and leave some to the imagination or you know... common sense. But i guess that'd leave them time to make characters that don't have the depth a muddy puddle and we just cant have that.

WITH THAT SAID THOUGH: I found it actually entertaining while I've been watching it, if there's one thing this movie does right, is that it's rarely boring. The action sequences were great (except for the car chase in new york, but i guess thats mainly due to my severe hatred towards shaky cam when its not needed), the visuals were spectacular, and while the movie is going it kinda manages to make you forget about how shallow and forced it is. 

So if you want to watch a film you can forget right after you walk out of the theater then go ahead, it fulfills the role of a popcorn flick very well. But don't expect it to be smart despite looking smart, because it'll deceive you just like a true magician.",literal
The most epic/greatest thing ever! Literally nothing can match the level of intensity like the show every season has literally one or two groundbreaking episodes each and every scene tells more with the picture and talking the fights the story the buildup the music the screenplay the acting the visuals each and everything was epic and never seen before wonder!from night king to iron throne to starks and lannisters every thing was beautifully written!no wonder greatest quotes are present in here too!politics and war was like i am playing that in real life such impact full it is!Although ending 3 episodes did'nt quite felt satisfying but it was digestable!not a perfect ending yet the greatest show of all time!,literal
Standard but still Watchable The standard Liam Neeson film. This has a little less action than his other films but it moves a long. Not sure why it's The Marksman. He doesn't do much shooting in the film but when he does it's very precise.,literal
"A Deadly Samurai Game Last Samurai Standing is Netflix's explosive new limited series that mashes up the historical depth of a classic samurai epic like Shogun with the ruthless death-game thrills of Squid Game. Set in Japan in the late 1800s, after the samurai class has been dismantled, the show follows hundreds of masterless warriors who are desperate and poor. They are lured into a sinister, secret tournament called ""Kodoku""-a battle royale where the last person standing wins a massive cash prize.

The heart of the story rests with Shujiro Saga (played by Junichi Okada), a former warrior who enters the deadly contest not for glory, but to win money to save his sick wife and child from a cholera outbreak. His personal mission, and his growing bond with a young girl he takes under his wing, gives the show its emotional center. It's this human element that stops the series from becoming just a parade of violence.

However, the real star of the show is the action. This is where Last Samurai Standing truly excels. The sword fights are absolutely incredible-visceral, brutal, and expertly choreographed. The camera work is fluid, using long takes to show off the performers' genuine skill with their weapons. You can tell the show's star, Okada, also served as the action choreographer, as every duel feels fast, dangerous, and real.

While some of the side characters aren't as deeply explored as you might hope, and the Squid Game comparisons are obvious, the series uses its historical setting to create a unique atmosphere. It's a violent, high-stakes ride that's perfect for binge-watching. If you love fast-paced, high-quality martial arts and tense survival stories, this is definitely one of the best action shows of 2025 and a must-see on Netflix.",literal
"Disappointing My brothers and I, my children and my grandchildren have always loved this story and the 1966 animated version seen every Christmas. As a huge Jim Carey fan, I expected to love this too. I didn't. I love Ron Howard films, too, but not this one. I particularly disliked the scene in Grinch's lair with broken glass and onion. However, Taylor Momsen is a delightful actress and her song ""Where are you Christmas?"" was perfect and truly touching! She was, however, the only character I enjoyed watching. Sorry, I find this lavish production very disappointing.",literal
"I think you guys are missing the point The show is literally about a group of privileged people navigating a fantasy version of their lives and there's an entire genre in comedy built around that idea. A lot of the criticism here feels like it's ignoring that on purpose. That being said, the first and second episodes aren't groundbreaking but they're fun and easy to watch.",literal
Season 2 falls flat In a nutshell it feels like it was aimed at tweens and the story fell far short of what I had personally expected. It just didn't feel like it fitted with forced but watered down Addams family quirkiness and a humour that is very obviously safe for Netflix. In some ways too tame. Missed the target imo.,figurative
"No classic, but with food for thought, thrills AND Monica Bellucci naked, go for it. The presence of Robert DeNiro and Charles Grodin in ""Midnight Run"" seemed to cause many people to wildly overrate that standard action movie; similarly, the we-hate-Forrest-Gump crowd approached the quietly compelling ""Cast Away"" with too much prejudice to view it fairly. In ""Brotherhood of the Wolf"" (the English-language title of ""Le Pacte des loups""), a character says that lies told in Latin can be seen as truth; the fact that this is a commercial film in French (with subtitles so you can fool yourself into feeling clever that you're watching an art movie) may explain why some are very, very enthusiastic about it. Not that the movie doesn't deserve praise (it does in a lot of ways); it's just that I wonder if they'd have been as impressed had it been the identical film shot in English and with an American cast (or with Americans other than Mark Dacascos).

Based on the French tale of a deadly creature that roamed the Gallic countryside in the 18th century and was never caught, ""Le Pacte des loups"" plays like a better, more coherent, more frightening version of ""Sleepy Hollow,"" with the representative from the major city (Samuel le Bihan)and his Iroquois Indian blood brother (Dacascos) sent to investigate the gruesome goings-on, and gradually finding out there's far more than meets the eye - although unlike ""Sleepy Hollow,"" which went overboard with the decapitations, the murders are kept to a minimum in the early going (we do see the beast attacking two of its female victims (the beast only attacks women and children) in the first half, but most of the details are kept to our imaginations... unlike later on in the movie). The movie takes its time setting the pace and mood, slipping in a few clues to the resolution - one hint: watch out for the gun - and risking losing the audience because it really is pretty methodical; but once all the main characters have been introduced, and once past the halfway point, the movie really starts to deliver.

Director/co-writer Christophe Gans leaves several narrative threads hanging, but barring a few plot holes this doesn't damage the movie's overall effect because so much stuff is woven into it; the tunnel vision of several of the characters, religious symbolism, conspiracy, a hint of incest between a crippled aristocratic hunter (Vincent Cassel) and his sister (Emilie Dequenne) that comes up in a crucial moment of the plot... provided you don't think it over too much afterwards (for starters, why does the beast not go after men?), or simply think on the movie's impressive visuals (the first fight scene and several thereafter are in slow motion, but when le Bihan launches an attack on the baddies towards the end - for reasons I won't divulge here - they come in regular speed; some of the CGI effects are a bit awkward, but the work of Jim Henson's Creature Shop is thankfully less like the Bloop in ""Lost in Space"" and more like their usual effective stuff, with a creature guaranteed to give you nightmares), it works just fine.

Mention should also be made of the fine score from Joseph LoDuca, no stranger to scoring uncharacteristically zesty historical stories after Hercules and Xena - his cue for our heroes going hunting and the final scene are standouts, although I could have lived without that song over the credits (sung in English, by the way); of the cast's acting, with special nods to Cassel, Dacascos, and Monica Bellucci as the prostitute who turns out to be more involved with the plot than it appears (if only American actors (and while we're at it, British ones) were as multilingual as their Continental counterparts); and of the brutal but effective fight scenes, with a particularly impressive climax. While this isn't the all-timer some say it is (that first hour IS a problem), I enjoyed it in the end; despite its reputation, French cinema has always had its accessible offerings (let's not forget it gave us ""Diva,"" Brigitte Bardot, ""La Cage aux Folles"" and Luc Besson, ""The Fifth Element"" notwithstanding), and this is further proof.

As for Monica Bellucci naked - definitely one of the most memorable (and unlike the other ones, decidedly pleasant) moments in the movie, with Gans throwing in an amazing dissolve from Miss Bellucci's topography to that of the French mountains. For once, Jim Henson's Creature Shop doesn't contribute the most impressive bodywork to a film.",figurative
"Babe Who? Ersatz (Jean) Shepherd-esquire presentation of sandlot baseball life in early 60's Southern Cal. A ""we didn't realize then what a great summer that was"" sort of movie, I guess better than most of the genre. Little Scotty Smalls moves into new neighborhood, gets adopted by baseball fanatic Vitar and his band of quirky irregulars, teen adventures ensue. Vitar has presence as the local star, hard to believe he hasn't done a lot since then. Complaints include: the narration was often annoying, I didn't have to hear every 5 minutes about the ""pickle"" Scotty was going to get into (particularly when you could work out all the intimate details of the ""pickle"" not long into the movie); and the language is much too harsh for small children, who are otherwise the best audience for this. Tired ""update"" on minor characters at film's end is balanced by touching finale with the two leads.

I can't think of one critique for this movie. It has original humor, the music is so catchy, and in a sea of identical storylines, this one totally stands out. When I first heard about it, I thought the concept would be cheesy. Oh boy was I wrong. As soon as the movie started, I knew this would be an instant favorite of mine.

"So Far So Good Task is an intriguing series. At its core, it's a hyperrealistic portrait of an FBI agent-an everyman in the truest sense-brought to life with quiet intensity by Mark Ruffalo. What makes it so compelling is how ordinary he feels, how grounded, even as he moves through extraordinary circumstances.

The criminals he pursues are not caricatures but unnervingly believable, their actions rendered with a detail that catches you off guard. The realism on both sides-the hunter and the hunted-creates a tension that feels lived-in rather than staged.

It's the rare show that lingers after the credits, not because it shouts, but because it whispers in ways you can't shake. Terrific television, worth sitting with.",literal
"Jimmie Walker Loves This Film!! Kathryn Bigelow virtually owns the genre of female-directed political thrillers and she does not disappoint with this entry reminiscent of ""Rashomon"" and ""Fail-Safe"" as Rebecca Ferguson is finally set free from the sidekick role to little Tommy Cruise in a dozen Mission Impossibles to play an analyst trying to stop a nuke headed to Chicago, regardless of the Cubs having a better than usual season. The perspective switches in time and POV in a deft fashion, and Idris Elba is his usual top-quality self as the President, just wishing he could pilot a ship into that freaky-deeky albino Alien creator's ship and get it over with. They're keeping their head above water, making a wave when they can, but all in all the cast and this film is DYN-O-MITE!!",literal

"Not original, but not bad When you consider the fact that this is the directorial debut of a YouTube movie critic, a lot of things about it make sense, for better and for worse.

Shelby Oaks is a horror movie that wears its inspirations on its sleeves. I was initially very surprised by the first 20 minutes or so being a mocumentary style reminiscent of something like Lake Mungo or Butterfly Kisses. I remember thinking ""This is going on for a while, I thought this was a regular movie, not a mocumentary,"" until the big trailer moment happened, and then the ""opening"" titles played.

It is fairly derivative in its story, making allusions to movies like Grave Encounters, Hell House LLC, Lake Mungo, The Ring, Hereditary and more, but while it doesn't really do anything to stand out, it is a well-made, mostly well written horror flick with a few good scares and pretty great cinematography and editing overall.

My only other main critique is the ending felt a bit rushed. I enjoyed the mystery but felt that the ending was hurried along and things concluded in too neat a bow. I don't really want to be too harsh about it, because I did overall enjoy it, and I genuinely do think that as a debut film by a newcomer to the industry, Stuckmann did a good job.",figurative
"Refreshing humor Wasn't sure what to expect, but I was hooked from the start-laughed way more than I thought I would! Chad Powers nails that classic redemption arc with a chewy moral core that keeps you rooting for him. The chemistry between Chad (Powell), the Head Coach (Zahn), and Daughter/Coach Ricky (Mattfeld) is spot-on-funny, heartfelt, and just the right amount of awkward charm. It manages to be sweet, hilarious, and uplifting all at once. I love the way it sprinkles in the message of second chances without being preachy. Honestly, I'm bummed there are only two episodes out so far-we wanted to binge more right away. Can't wait for the other episodes!",literal

"Disappointing Ending - Season 5 Finale of Poldark The final season of Poldark was a huge letdown for many fans, including myself. Several key aspects of the story felt rushed, underdeveloped, and unsatisfying. Here are some of the main issues I had with the finale: 1. Unnecessary Storylines: The plot involving Officer Ned felt irrelevant to the season. There was a missed opportunity to focus more on Ross and his family's journey to restore their wealth and legacy.

2. Morrwenna's Inconsistent Behavior: Morrwenna's sudden change of heart regarding her son was jarring. I was expecting a more substantial reunion or a clearer decision, but instead, it was a confusing back-and-forth.

3. George Warleggan's Fate: Given his many crimes throughout the series, I was disappointed that George wasn't jailed in the final season. A more fitting consequence for his actions seemed warranted.

4. The Children's Inexplicable Stagnation: It felt like time stood still for Ross and Demelza's children. Despite the passing of time, they remained unchanged, while other characters' children grew noticeably.

5. The Closure of Trenwith: After George's imprisonment, it would have made sense for Ross to inherit Trenwith and raise Jeffrey Charles there. Instead, the whole storyline was left hanging.

6. Jeffrey Charles and the Girl: Jeffrey Charles' relationship felt rushed and shallow. His interaction with the girl he loves, where she brushes off their connection as a mere infatuation, was a disappointing way to end their story.

7. Missed Potential with Key Characters: Several key characters, were written off without proper closure. The show often introduced characters and plotlines, only to abandon them with no real explanation.

Overall, the final season felt like a missed opportunity. The storylines that were built up over the years deserved more respect and attention. The ending felt forced and left me with a sense of dissatisfaction.",figurative
"A Riveting Ride into the Alaskan Wilds - A Must-Watch Thriller From the very first moments, The Last Frontier grips you with tension, danger, and emotional depth. Jason Clarke delivers a powerhouse performance as U. S. Marshal Frank Remnick - equal parts steely lawman and deeply wounded family man. He carries the series with a magnetic presence, giving the show much more than just procedural muscle.

Dominic Cooper is a standout in his role, injecting nuance and charm even as his character operates in morally gray territory. His scenes crackle with energy, and every moment he shares onscreen with Clarke or Bennett feels electric.

Haley Bennett as the lead actress (CIA operative Sidney Scofield) rounds out the central trio beautifully. She balances toughness and vulnerability in a way that makes her character feel both unpredictable and empathetic. She never feels like a ""sidekick"" - in her own right, she's an emotional anchor for the story, giving voice to the series' stakes beyond just action and survival.

What truly elevates The Last Frontier is how it marries natural suspense with human drama. The vast, icy wilderness becomes a third character - relentless, unforgiving, and hauntingly beautiful. Yet even in the cold, there are warm moments: familial tension, grief, betrayal, and alliances testing under strain.

Yes, the plot leans on familiar tropes (escaped inmates, backcountry chases, conspiracies), but the cast imbues every scene with a spark that keeps you leaning forward. The pacing is strong; the action sequences are visceral; and the quieter interludes, where characters face their fears or regrets, are the ones that really stick.

If you're looking for a thriller that delivers both spectacle and soul, The Last Frontier - anchored by Clarke, Cooper, and Bennett - should be at the top of your watchlist.",figurative
Oldie but goldie Finished all four seasons of this show in 2021 and I must say I do enjoy finding some older shows that I missed on. I loved Cathy ( Laura Linney is excellent in every role she plays) Cathy husband on the other hand is narcissistic ego maniac that pretty much only thinks about himself. Her son could appreciate his mother more and her brother is goofy but not in a chariming way. So family is kinda all over the place. All and all I would recommend this for easy watch but the show do gets dragged on as the seasons progress and you are just expecting to see how will it end.,literal
"Awesome Show I don't leave reviews very often but I had to for this show. I have not seen the UK version and don't really care to because this show is just top notch. I had never heard of this show since I work overseas but ended up catching the 5th episode and absolutely loved it. I told all of the guys in the fire station about it and ever since we have had to catch up on all of the previous episodes. Everyone in the department loves this show and that is a hard thing to do. All of the characters are just great and have so many flaws. William H. Macy does an awesome job as the dysfunctional father. I gave it the highest review I think a show can receive because I don't think there is a perfect show, but this comes darn close. I definitely recommend this show.",literal

"It's starting out very well. I'm a long time fan of Steve Martin and Martin Short so I had to check out this series. Their past collaborations are electric. Im not aware of Selena Gomez's work but I know WHO she is.

After reading other reviews, it's fairly obvious there are many Selena fans who wanted to voice their overwhelming approval of her performance to pad the rating. Those ""reviews"" stand out because they are not really reviews, just kudos because they are ardent fans. Tell us WHY you liked it!!!! I'm sure many who stated such and also stating their admiration for the other leads' past work was a token. I can't imagine the fandom realistically includes legendary septuagenarian comedic movie and stage actors and a Disney popstar. If I had a dollar for everytime I read the word ""amazing"", I could produce the show.

I digress - this show, after 3 episodes is fabulous!! I hate most TV shows created in recent years. Comedies are formulaic, recycled crap. Drama is redundant and stale. I give some with an interesting premise a chance - 99.9% fail. The ONLY network shows I like now are NCIS, the original, and Young Sheldon. Streaming: Stranger Things and Alien TV. Yes, I'm odd that way. Castle Rock was cancelled, so.... I love quirky original concepts like 3rd Rock from the Sun, Big Bang Theory, the aforementioned Stranger Things and Alien TV ,etc. This show has it all. It's hilarious, dramatic, thrilling, mysterious, eclectic, thatrical and insane all at the same time. It's a definite rollercoaster ride of emotions. If you didn't bust a rib with the cats ""arrival"" on scene then you are dead inside.

Steve Martin is his usual sardonic self and teaming him with Martin Short's over-the-top theatrics - their sarcastic banter is always entertaining, add to that Selena Gomez's deadpan snarky often dismissive repartee with them is priceless!! They have fantastic chemistry for their 3 very distinct personality types. I'm quite impressed at her ability to hold her own with these two and it was so refreshing to hear a young woman have a lower register voice for once and NOT hearing ""super"" this and that constantly. C'mon people, there are other synonyms for that word. It makes you sound silly and unintelligent.

The storyline kept my attention and I love how they cut to each characters unique perspective in interpreting the clues they have; Short ""auditioning"" the tenants and Selena's visions/delusions. They throw in backstories with flashbacks and ambiguous habits to build the character profiles.

Finally, the supporting cast - masterful casting in my opinion. The tenants are the kookiest group of people you could ever imagine and they all live in the same building!!! Nathan Lane AND Sting as well!! Great!!

I was sad when episode 3 ended, I now have to wait until next week but it's worth it. You never know what will happen scene to scene or for that matter, what may come out of their mouth.

So yes, millennials and Gen Z...Selena was AMAZING!!!! So are the rest.",figurative
"Average but cult SF action flick Arnold Schwarzenegger, Maria Conchita Alonso, Jesse Ventura and Sven-Ole Thorsen. No, I didn't watch Predator again. :D

Futuristic action movie based on Steven King's story, published under pseudonym Richard Bachman, tells a story about modern gladiator games in which convicts get a chance to win their freedom if they survive the arena. Movie about totalitarian regime, media monopoly and a world at the edge of ecological and economical disaster. And about always current 'panem et circenses' tactics. It was made in 1987. and story is placed in 2017. Once described future comes to pass, futuristic movies usually become unconvincing, but not this one. Although actual 2017. and 2017. in this movie seemingly have no touch points, difference is only in appearance, while essentially they are much more alike than we are comfortable to admit.

"Enjoyable In two previous films we've seen how the Four Horsemen group of stage magicians/performance artists use stage magic/illusions to carry out large-scale hoaxes, heists, capers, performances in order to exact justice upon unethical power players and wealth hoarders. Well, they're back. Or, to be more precise, a group of young wannabes pretending to be the Horsemen is back. And the target this time turns out to be South African diamond magnate, money launderer, blood diamond facilitator, and all-round nasty b*tch Veronika Vandenberg.

To be honest, much of the plot is a bit far-fetched, and many questions remain unanswered. But it's a good enough excuse to see all our old friends back in action, together with some new ones. The set design is great (particularly Chateau Roussillon), the set-pieces are fun, Rosamund Pike chews the scenery nicely, and the aggressive interplay between Bosco and Atlas works well.

I classify this as undemandingly enjoyable, particularly if you enjoyed the first two.",literal

"Cournerstone of all modern TV series It took me around two years to complete the series, but I think it was for the better. I was kind of not used to this TV-show structure where the episodes are more like a series of discrete, independent from one another, complete mini-stories with barely palpable main plot thread happening somewhere in the background sewing all the episodes into one fabric of a cohesive world. That being said, I feel like I lost nothing by not binge-watching the whole series in a matter of weeks. Since there wasn't any intricated and convoluted story many details of which I would had to remember in order to enjoy it, I gave myself time to savour each episode independently from one another. Initially, you may not grasp the greatness of ""The Sopranos"", but as the seasons pass, the multifaceted and deep characters start to grow on you, levaing you no choice but to appreciate the genius of the scriptwriting as well as the perfomance of the actors it was written for. Take, for example James Gandolfini, who seems to have been born for the role of Tony Soprano. I don't think it would be an exaggeration to say that his performance in the show is the most prominent in all of the history of television. As a result, ""The Sopranos"" transformed the industry and set a new standard for TV series to strive for.",figurative
"About the songs Actually, the songs touched me so deeply. The lyrics, the music, the choreography - everything was done so well. It made me cry 😩. The genre felt like a perfect blend of old-school K-pop and modern styles, and I really loved that. I just wish there were more songs. I was really hoping they'd end with ""Together,"" but they didn't... and that honestly made me cry again.

I can definitely say it was so fun and emotional to watch. If real K-pop idols ever sang those songs, I would absolutely listen to them without hesitation.

There's just something so special about how music can connect people - even fictional performances can leave such a strong impression. The visuals, the energy, the meaning behind every lyric... it all stayed with me long after the performance ended. I keep replaying it in my mind, wishing it wasn't over yet.",literal
"Weird and Quirky Love this weird little show. 100% credit goes to the wonderful Tim Robinson, who has one of the most expressive faces in television.

In many ways the show reminds me of another quirky gem from 2010 called ""The Increasingly Poor Decisions of Todd Margaret"".

The show won't likely win any awards as The Pitt did, but is nevertheless a fun watch.

And a very special mention goes to Joseph Tudisco who more than holds his own against the formidable Robinson.",figurative
"Yellowstone My opinion of this franchise is based on the fact that I viewed 5 seasons in two weeks. I couldn't get enough, but this waiting for the new content has left me not wanting to continue watching.

The character development and storyline in my opinion is ranked in the top 10. Cole Hauser's character. Works very well in the series. I saw him in another movie and it just did not carry the same realism as it does in Yellowstone.

Kelly Riley's character is riveting, but I don't know if it would be as entertaining in a spinoff or other series.

Taylor Sheridan has come out with so many great new series. I re-watched 1883 and it was completely gut wrenching but loved every minute of it.",literal
"Surprisingly good. Roofman tells the quite extraordinary story of a small sympathetic criminal, played by Channing Tatum. He falls for a woman, played by Kirsten Dunst, that is completely unaware of his criminal past. The whole plot is based on true events which made it even more interesting to follow. Without spoiling anything, if you like a lighthearted crime/romance, you should check this one out, it's certainly worth watching.",literal
"A Nightmare On Elm Street homage that delivers I loved the first Black Phone so does Scott Derrickson's Nightmare On Elm Street inspired sequel deliver just as much as the first one does? It comes close. What I really liked was that they chose to return with the original characters and we see how they are handling what has happened to them while they deal with what happened to in the previous film. The Grabber is a very cool horror character and seeing some of his past was definitely interesting. This had great cinematography especially jumping between dream sequences and reality. The returning cast does an amazing job bringing these characters to life again but Ethan Hawke stands out once again making the Grabber even more terrifying this time around. This may not be as good as the first one but it's definitely still worth checking out and seeing in theaters!

"Gripping drama I was pleasantly surprises to see Season 3 up on Amazon's site

This show is DARK. Not bleak, full of deapair or unaettling -- it's DARK. Picking up a few months (?) after S2, Emily is front amd center, getting banged up and flipping off authority whenever possible. I'm only 3 eps in so I can't really say a lot except it's clearly going to be as stress-inducing to watch as it's predecessors. I never watched Castle, so I'n not familiar with Stana's work there, but she def has the brooding cop thing down!

Technically, overall the visuals are a little brighter (not forcing me to brighten up the picture just to see what's going on) and the audio is better by normalizing dialogue.

Glad it's back - hope there is more, but nothing seems to make it past 3 seasons anymore.",literal
"Please make more!!! My family and friends love it!

I hope this is a series that will keep going!!! We are sitting on the edge of our seats, gripped, waiting for the next episode!! It's very compelling. Would really love to see some big mountains in the show. It's the wild rugged landscape that also makes the show great to watch!

Absolutely love, Jason Clarke!!

Awesome show!",literal
"Better than expected I thought it was a solid movie which is hard to find lately. Good mix of action, suspense, and drama.

The storyline was generic, but the acting was great/felt authentic. I liked how it didn't go overboard with the action.",literal
"Great series in all departments I binged this whole series in one sitting. Such I loved every minute of it. Had me guessing. Lots of red herrings. Amazing performances, direction, writing, production design, editing - better than most movies these days. Amazing work.

The story played out in such a great sequence. I also loved the locations which became characters for the series.

Thank you to this whole team, you are all so talented. I hope you all collaborate again and make more mystery series. We need more content like this -",literal
"Keep It Coming These reviews are ridiculous for only 2 episodes!

This show is not House or Elementary!

It's WATSON!

Let the characters develop! Let the plot thicken! You people are insufferable!

I love the cast. I can't wait to see what Ingrid is up to and which way she'll go. I love how he picks at Spephensss 'sss 😂😂 Desperate for more lore with Shinwell. Love the set design and cinematography. Really love how we didn't have to wait for Moriarty. Love the ""costumes"". The cases were exciting and well blended with detective work. I enjoyed that the most.

I usually like to wait for an entire season to end, then binge watch but I simply cannot wait with this show. I'm excited to learn these characters and see what Morris can bring to Watson. He's killing it!",literal
2 different storylines both good. Seems to me like there is really 2 storylines here the Saul/Jimmy story then the Mike/Gus outside of meeting a few times not sure how they tie in together but overall a good show I recommend especially if you like breaking bad alot of characters come back. Love Mike I'd like a show of just him but this is solid glad they kept the Breaking Bad life going.,literal
"Bad Premise. Bad ending. Bad Bad. 'Nuremberg' does not work. Here's why.

1. The premise. If the USA Prosecutor (played by Michael Shannon) cannot 'win' in the trial of The Nazi High Command (primarily Hermann Goering (played by Russell Crowe)), then .... then ... then what? Does a 'loss' mean that the former Nazis will all walk free? Do you want the viewer to believe that they would not be executed in any case? Ridiculous. But there's more.

2. Premise #2. In order to guarantee victory in the courtroom, the US asks an Army psychiatrist (Ramy Melek) to work with Goering; a way to learn more about him as a man, and so obtain information to be used against him in court. Again, ridiculous. But wait, wait for this.

3. What the psychiatrist learns from Goering does indeed help to 'convict' him. But the real incriminating information does not come from the psychiatrist's findings, rather it comes from a statement read aloud by the Prosecuting Attorney representing the United Kingdom. And so the premise of the U. S. shrink infiltrating the Nazi's mind, and this being the most important event in the trial, this goes for naught. Goering does himself in. But his fellow Nazis were going to be put to death, because of the U. K.'s revelations. And - this is not a spoiler, it's public record - they were.

A waste of talent, a waste of time.",literal
"Somewhat Entertaining I was curious to give this series a try simply because it has Ted Danson and Stephanie Beatriz. I really wanted to see how they would play off each other.

While the story is somewhat entertaining, and the setting uncommon for a TV series, there were problems that made it a bit lackluster.

For one, the supporting cast were uneven in their performances. Some were good; others were not very memorable, and in a few cases even painful to watch.

Which means that Danson and Beatriz really had to carry the show. They don't quite succeed. I think that's because the script wasn't as exemplary as it needed to be.

And so, unfortunately, the dynamics between Danson and Beatriz's characters weren't really there. The two actors didn't even have many scenes together.",literal
"One Punch Man is a Must-Watch anime of 2015 Out of all the anime that I have seen throughout 2015, this anime is the climax of 2015 and I have seen many anime's. There is just something special about this anime that gets me all hyped up when watching it; I am also very impressed by the Madhouse company for making a high quality and this elegant series. As this anime is not like the typical anime with its confusing plot and plot twist, One punch man has a very basic concept but turns the concept into something so original very pleasing to watch and as the series only having 12 episodes I am very sad that it had to come to an end. Thank you very much Toei!!! Hope there are many more seasons with this to come.",figurative
"Ten starts are not enough for the show I'm happy to say that this show and by all means is the best show I've ever seen in my entire life. I've seen lots of shows as I'm addicted to them, but this one touched something in my heart and soul. If you watched 1883 and 1923 the series, Yellowstone would make sense to you and you will fall in love with the story and it's drama. I love stories that has long history like Yellowstone and how it started. The show had a great beginning and greater closure and this is very rare to see nowadays. I need to recommend this show for people and I would love to see something that has the same greatness one day.",literal
"Yellowstone - The best of Bonanza, Dallas, and Dynasty The Dutton family (the father, three sons, and a daughter) has philosophical, positional, and financial differences. The father (Kevin Costner as John Dutton) is a resolute leader, and his children share his determination and loyalty, but differ on the means to solutions. One son (Luke Grimes as Cory Dutton) finds himself outside the clan; but when his family loyalty is tested, he proves himself but at great expense.

Taylor Sheridan (Wind River, Hell or High Water, and Sicario) has done it again (creating a very interesting story with great action). His characters seem so real; and the dilemmas they face are so complex, but understandable. You actually feel Cory's pain when he is torn between his wife (and her Native American relatives) and his family. S1 E1 has a very emotional scene (Cory and his wife) that no one will dismiss; it's so real and well-acted.

Finally, no one does a better job presenting a gun fight than Taylor Sheridan. Taylor knows guns and he knows what happens when guns are fired. The gunfight in Wind River was exceptional, and Mr. Sheridan presents the same authenticity in Yellowstone.",literal
"A gripping, stressful start Great start to a show. I loved that episode 1 got straight to the point, it throws you straight into the drama, no dilly-dallying with build up. Only a few episodes in, but each one has been gripping and well-paced. I've only ever seen Sarah Snook in Succession but she's very believable in this as a worried mother.",literal
"The connections to original NCIS So far so great! I actually had the privilege of vising the set on a recent trip to Paramount Studios and it was mind blowing to see the actual office sets.

A few of the details in NCIS Origins have been changed from NCIS, but so far not enough to alter history, Vis-à-vis, Star Trek (2009) vs. The original series.

The series does a good job of filling in some of Gibbs's back story from the original, but Austin Stowell has not yet transitioned Gibbs the cold, no nonsense, loner that Mark Harmon portrays. Can you picture the Gibbs we know going out with the team socially, attending veteran support meetings, and going by his first name Leroy? It will be interesting to see the transition as the series hopefully progresses.

The best character crossover so far is Kyle Schmid to Muse Watson's Mike Franks. The attitude and physical appearance make for good continuity. Though we only see Muse Watson in one episode as a NIS agent, the connection is there. Some details like his dress code seem altered in Origins but, again, not universe altering.

It will be very interesting to see the introduction of more of the characters we know and love from the original series.",figurative
"Overdone Typical of American movies, over dramatic, unrealistic scenes and claiming their fame at the end. So much unnecessary stuff that is not telling the story. As usual, the best part was Russell Crow and his presence. Hard not to like him and how he demands attention. One scene that annoyed me the most was the lawyer with paper pages coving the floor. As if...",literal
"4th time is the charm!!! Fantastic Four First Steps is an awesome movie!!! 20th Century Fox should be a shame of themselves. It took Marvel Studios and Disney one try to get it right. They respected the material. The whole cast was phenomenal but to me the highlight were Vanessa Kirby as Sue Storm, Julia Garner as Sliver Surfer, and Ralph Ineson as Galactus. This is 2 straight movies Marvel has made that has been hits. We are heading in the right direction. Spider Man A Brand New Day your up next.",literal
"Hard to care about the characters I finished this series, it was good enough for that, and I'm a huge fan of Jason Bateman and Jude Law, but I didn't binge the series and it had very slow moments. I don't mind slow, but because these characters were unlikeable, I didn't really care about sifting through the slow, relationship-building moments.

These characters have huge flaws and the only redeeming quality is their loyalty to each other. They were annoying often, made a lot of dumb decisions, and constantly went back and forth between being terrified/stressed to laughing and joking like nothing happened.

Didn't care for the ending either, maybe because I didn't care about the characters. I felt like Jude Law's ending was too simple and kind of empty.

If you're looking for something to watch, it's definitely entertaining enough for that, but it's not as gripping as it wants to be and you may find yourself sighing with frustration a lot. But although I didn't care for the ending, the last 2-3 episodes were gripping in the way I wanted the whole series to be. So if you can stick it out, it gets a lot more fun to watch then.",literal
"Fun autumn watch I thoroughly enjoyed watching the show. And it kept me engaged the whole time:) I don't get all the hate and especially the hate for the ending, even though I wished they would have gone a bit deeper into the dark gritty cult stuff and the brainwashing that's at the core. I definitely look forward to a second season.",literal
"love the kung fu action In 1764, the beast arrives in France. In one year, the fear has spread far sending the region of Gévaudan into darkness. Grégoire de Fronsac is a naturalist from King Louis XV's court. He and his Iroquois companion Mani investigate. They examine survivors and bodies. They encounter Captain Duhamel and his men who are hunting the beast. Fronsac figures the beast to be 500 pounds.

This French movie marries a costume period piece with some kung fu action and the horrors of a werewolf. I don't find the costume drama that compelling. Other than Mani, I don't find anybody that compelling. I love the kung fu action though. It's a fascinating marriage. There are some fun moments with an interesting idea. The wolf horror isn't that scary but it's still good.",literal
"Disgusting ""poor man"" Propaganda SPOILERS SPOILERS

This movie is bad! Offensively bad! Dakota Johnson is her usual dead eyes monotone self giving monologue after monologue like a assistant forced to read opposite the real leads. There is ZERO chemistry with any of the leads. The most offensive part is when they use a rape subplot to further the romantic relationship of Dakota's character. There is literally a scene where her boss who is a WOMAN basically says ""meh it happens to every match maker"" and basically says that is how dating is you either get r8ped or get married. The poor victim is harassed by her attacker and it's used as an excuse for dakota and chris's characters to profess their love and make out. The ending of that storyline is the victim ""gets back out there"" and finds love and Dakota gets a promotion! No mention of new protocols being put in place or vetting of men. It was honestly disgusting and I can't believe it is not talked about more.",literal
"Top TV Shows of All Time I am not one to beat around the bush so here it goes:

This show is epic in its entirety. The writing, characters, plot, cinematography, the pacing and the incredible transformation just pushes this show into a league of it's own. It takes you into a world we haven't quite ever seen before, a world where the sad and unaccomplished Walter White turns into a genius mad-man. You can see the character evolve into a selfish, power-hungry villain who you just love to hate. Vince Gilligan did an amazing job not following the lead of most tv shows out there right now. He knew how to build a story without making you feel like you are underwhelmed and when he knew it was time for this show to end (although I felt a hole in my heart for days after the finale), he didn't care about the money or the fans or the critics, he just ended it the exact moment it was supposed to end.

Bryan Cranston is a power house and completely embodies first Walter White, and later Heisenberg to such amazing heights, you really cannot see anyone else acting this part. That is what, I believe, sets his character apart from most characters we see on TV. He dominates every episode and that is not the say that the rest of the cast don't put in their best efforts (they are all amazing in their own way), but he just has this energy that is undeniable and you cannot help but root for him and the crazy plans he comes up with.

Epic is the only one word you can use to describe a show like this. The only show I feel sometimes touches the bar of this pure excellence, is Vikings and it still does not come close to how well thought out Breaking Bad as a whole series truly is.",literal
"Wings of Disinterest Wim Wender's ""Wings of Desire"" has spoiled angel movies for me. It was so beautiful and so thought provoking that all other angel movies have been a ""meh"" for me. ""Good Fortune"" is the same.

I'd describe it as ""watchable."" - It's got a wonderful cast and they are funny. Keaneu Reeves quirky acting style gives his angel character uniqueness. Keke Palmer was the highlight and the only character I cared much about. Aziz Ansari's limited acting range holds back the movie a little. I think Seth Rogan was supposed to be an unlikable antagonist to Aziz Ansari but I didn't find myself hating or liking either one. I adore Sandra Oh but the script didn't give her much to work with.

The movie is a commentary on late-stage capitalism which is a solid concept but I didn't get any insights or feel any compelling emotions beyond ""the system stinks.""

I know ""Good Fortune"" is getting decent reviews but maybe those people never saw Wim Wender's masterpiece.",figurative
"A different approach to horror genre Sinners is a historical horror directed by Ryan Coogler (Black Panther, Creed) which smartly combines the supernatural with the political.

The cinematography is stunning, which accurately captures the 1930s western vibes. While the movie starts pretty slow and takes time for the build up, it picks up in the second half by delivering a haunting experience. The movie often feels very lively due to it's musical numbers.

The film's fascinating array of genres and tropes and ideas swirls together, whether be it oppression of race, or preaching of good and evil. Jordan gives a great performance, while the rest of the cast were terrific too.

Although the horror element was less than my expectations, however the political satire and the tense atmosphere makes Sinners a great movie.

The Geek Reviewer gives 4 stars for 'Sinners'.",literal
Baddd The season 1 was going pretty well and it was filled with action and fights but season 2 is the worst season because of the animation and sound effects,literal
Keri Russell is amazing I have been a fan of Keri Russell since The Americans. This series is excellent from the acting to the plot. Every episode the drama builds and the plot thickens. Keri Russell brings the same intensity as she did in the Americans. Her toughness as a Diplomat comes out the way it did in The Americans. A true badass woman who is as beautiful as she is strong is a great combination. Enough action mixed in to an acting strong show really sets it up as a series you want to binge watch. I hope it continues and builds the next season into an even important government role. Hint hint. All the actors are perfect for their roles. You find yourself attached to all the actors and the parts they play. I highly recommend this series if you like a great story line with powerful actors.,figurative
"Disappointed With as good as Bateman's previous work has been (Ozark) and the hype leading up to this, it was disappointing. Two major reasons: 1) It's SLOW. Like, really slow.

2) Why, when made for people to watch on their TV's, in their homes, almost all of which don't have a theatre room (FYI to Hollywood), is it shot so dark that most of the time it's hard to see what is going on or who is even in the room.l?

Sorry, but this seems like it was made for the directors enjoyment, not the audiences.",literal
"One of the best series ! I binge watched The Pitt in 3 days. I loved the chaos, the emotions, the realistic images of the emergency room. It felt like they were showing the authentic version of doctors and their work, the ups and downs of working in a hospital in stead of showing this idealized version like in Grey's Anatomy. Let's say I wouldn't want to be a doctor after watching this haha! They also included important topics such as gun violence, drug misuse, suicidal tendencies, misgendering, overprotective parenting etc. You really felt for the patients and the doctors! Great acting skills. I loved everything about it. I can't wait for season 2 :)",literal
"Oh so good!!! Want to put it at 8.5 stars. Just got done watching episode six of this series. This series is so intense and seems to be well written, beautifully acted and everything else. One of the best cop shows I've seen. I thought it was over with but there's one episode left.

Mark Ruffalo of course is excellent and a surprise (for me) Tom Pelphrey just blows my mind. The supporting cops, the niece, children and some bad guys are amazing as well. (Don't want to spoil anything here.)

Thank you for a suspenseful, amazing show! I think my heart is still beating fast after tonight.",figurative
"Never Miss It! Nathan Fillion's character is such a great example of how life experiences can be priceless. Even though he is an older rookie, it is obvious that the other characters are slowly beginning to realize this. Officer Nolan is thoughtful, caring, intelligent, yet respectful. The entire cast mesh so well! While I hope this show is renewed for several seasons, I'm curious to find out how they will maintain his rookie status over time.",literal
"What a fun movie... Having gone through the little league stage with my son and his friends, I thought this was really a touching and wonderful movie about what boys love to do in the summer, organized or not.  We could relate to it since we have the quiet athletic one in the family and the other characters we've all known in one fashion or another.  The goofy loud one, the pint-sized one with the stand-out ears, and the serious one without much of a father around.  Loved it - and loved the James Earl Jones part.  What a joyful laugh he has!

If you love kids, love baseball, love summer, and love a nice warm film, see it.  It has ended up in our library of films we watch again and again. Makes me smile thinking of it!",literal
"Firefighters and their daily lives Five seasons of this were refreshing and original making for entrancing, exciting and entertaining television. At launch it was a novel concept and a little ground breaking with a genuine presentation of female firefighters alongside their male counterparts. A strong blend of fire station procedural elements with the daily trials and tribulations of a decent ensemble cast.

Some great characters, particularly the fabulous portrayal of Gabriela Dawson by Monica Raymund who anchored the show for me.

Season six lost its sparkle and I only watched four episodes of seven before giving up; still not sure if the show got worse, got repetitive or 'it's not you it's me' took over - likely a blend of all three.",figurative
"This show likes itself way too much Um...I guess it's just us, but my husband and I stopped after the 3rd episode. I loved it at first but quickly realized it was just too too much. I get the realness of the chaos and stress, but it seemed like they jammed in every possible story line ever imagined. Big corporate takeover - check! Underage abortion - check! Bizarre accident - check, check, check!

And the characters -- so one dimensional. We have the stoic, tragic doctor. The straight-laced, humorless intern. The naive, farm-boy intern. The sassy, tough intern. The working-class white male racist. The no-nonsense head nurse. Single-minded hospital administrator. Hot young doctor. Hot older doctor. Hot maverick doctor.

I also found the acting over the top. The episode with the brother and sister debating whether to take their father off life support was enough for me. The actor playing the sister was too unbelievable, the sibling relationship was unconvincing, and the soliloquies to the dying father were straight out of a Hallmark Channel movie. Ugh.

Every character is so bloody earnest; makes it so unbelievable and inauthentic.

I get that the lack of subtlety or nuance is a big part of the appeal, but it turned us off.",literal
"Couldn't wait for it to end. I really couldn't wait for this to end, I felt it just dragged on & on forever, I felt I had been watching it for 20 years by the time it finally finished.

It started of OK, a black comedy but then it just got more and more serious and more and more nastier with more and more annoying accents and characters with each episode, music became less and less as episode one started with some good tunes. Constantly hearing Jesse scream yo, bitch, was making my head feel like it wanted to explode.

Really I found it all a bit daft, going round and round in circles and about 2 episodes too long. Maybe it's a cultural thing but it really didn't do a great deal for me though it was good in places, Walt played his part well turning from a nice man into a total back stabbing pos by the end.

Both my Mrs and I were relieved when it came to end, it was OK, but not as great as the hype suggest. The main message, crime doesn't pay unless your a politician.",literal
"Another Expensive Reboot with Nothing to Say Yet another costly reinterpretation of a story we've already seen and re-seen hundreds of times. Frankenstein 2025 fits the current trend where every director feels compelled to ""sign"" a classic, reshaping it in their own image - not out of necessity, but out of vanity. The result is a film that feels purely commercial, with millions spent on visuals and production, but nothing new to express.

The ending is artificial and incoherent, pushing the central idea - an inhuman being who is somehow human - to such extremes that it collapses under its own weight. There's no emotional core, no narrative tension, just a virtual spectacle.

This film reflects a time when cinema no longer renews itself but recycles myths into hollow simulations. It's not storytelling - it's aesthetic posturing. In this context, cinema feels stillborn.",literal
"I really liked the first season, but I LOVED the second I am obsessed about season 2. There are so many fascinating characters and the performance of the actors behind them is superb.

I enjoyed the first season. It was cruel, real and funny. The characters are horrible people and because of that I don't think it's for everyone. But I personally had a great time watching it.

The second explores different type of relationships (father-son, lovers, friends, employer-employees) in such an interesting and entreating way that I just wanted to see the next episode to keep watching them interacting. The focus is more on gender, which I also love. It definitely entered my top favorite shows.",literal
"Wow! Great series of 1880 politics and the Forgotten President James Garfield Outstanding. I recommend reading a synopsis of James Garfield first, as that helps provide more context and insight on the times and the names of historical figures.

Absolutely brilliant series. The actors, writers, director and crew brought together great production values! From what they put together I think this series, along with Lincoln with Daniel Day Lewis should be shown as a teaching medium to school students. The politics of now is no different to 145 years ago- polarized, divided, and ineffective. Can we not get along, and make our great country stronger? A question then, as now, and this series shows the actors and writers elegantly working through that question.

Well done in every aspect- I am not political at all, and this series was an excellent example of entertainment and teaching all in one!",literal
"Good show, looking forward tot season 2. The overall plot is a bit bleak but the acting is good and it just keeps you watching.",literal
"Disappointing rip-off of Brilliant Minds Watson is a decidedly disappointing series, essentially a rip-off of the far superior Brilliant Minds. If you are only watching one medical mystery series this year, make it Brilliant Minds, and give Watson a pass.

The stories are dull, the pacing of the show is slow, and the characters are stiff and unappealing. The weak hook of tying this series to Dr Watson (as well of Sherlock Holmes and Moriarty) does nothing to impress, and there is certainly no connection to the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle stories.

I have made it through the first four episodes but I doubt I will stick with this series much longer.",figurative
"Glued till the end!!! Watched my first ever premier screening in the heart of USA, AMC NYC times square.

Welcome watch for the horror movie fans!! You will be glued till the end of movie with secrets starts unfolding at almost 70 percent. But what a movie...Yet to watch Sinners and let me in movie but every second of the Weapon was entertaining. If anyone has watched brand new cherry flavor on Netflix, the movie is close to that, sorry for the little spoiler. But the movie still won my heart.",literal
"A welcome sequel that captures the fun and quality of the original, but doesn't bring much new to the table to make it truly stand out. Nobody was an unexpected delight, elevated by the legendary Bob Odenkirk as the iconic and likable protagonist. The continuation takes the traditional sequel route of being bigger, louder, and doubling down on everything that worked the first time. That doesn't necessarily make it better, but it's still a lot of fun-just not as refreshing.

The film repeats many of the same story beats as the original, which works both for and against it. On one hand, it maintains the charm of the first; on the other, it feels a little too familiar.

The cast is once again the highlight, with secondary characters getting more to do, and Sharon Stone stepping in as a memorable new villain.

The ending, however, feels a bit too rushed considering the buildup.

Overall, it's a welcome sequel that captures the fun and quality of the original, but doesn't bring much new to the table to make it truly stand out.",literal
"It's not Christmas without the Griswold's! I think I've seen this movie at least once every year since it's release! I love silly, off-the-wall comedy and the Vacation movies were some of the best in the day. Yes, over the years some of the jokes/stunts have become humdrum but I still have moments of laugh out loud enjoyment. Aunt Bethany saying grace before the meal is the best!",literal
"Not a great trailer I wanted to watch the trailer, but my glasses are off and then the entire first episode started playing. I got sucked in like watching a hallmark movie for men. I've been watching well past the duration of a trailer, but it's not because it's good. If the show wins an award, it's because they pretended the show sucked for however long I've been watching. Ultimately, I have no idea who this show is for and I'm left with questions, like, is this show about CTE?",literal
"A power struggle a class and cast system of raw dirt, ego and tough love! ""TNT's"" new series ""Animal Kingdom"" is one that pushes the limit of cable TV it's a brash, provocative, and outspoken family crime drama that takes no prisoners. Based somewhat on the 2010 film of the same name, the series follows the life and crime adventures of one southern California family. The head leader is the tough and sexy cougar mother and grandmother Smurf(the still sexy Ellen Barkin)who helps run the show of money, bribes, heist, and criminal jobs with the help of her sons and the one that is the standout to me is the adopted one Baz(Scott Speedman)and enter her young hormone driven grandson Cody(Shawn Hatosy)who joins the crew after his mother dies from a drug overdose. And boy I must say this series is well spiced up with plenty of vices like sex, drugs, and family drama really those themes top the blood and violence of the series. Really this is one cool wild kick butt California sun and ocean series.",literal
"Snappy dialogue and a great cast I thought this was a great start. Seen first two episodes. The dialogue really is snappy and had me laughing. Liked all the cast. It's to me like a mix of the West Wing and a political thriller. Great cast and good central characters, great settings in London.

To me it doesn't have to be all car chases and machine guns. It has some twists so far. So keeps me interested. I love shows with a bit of gritty language dropped in by powerful clever people trying to work to hold the world together and not just focussed on the usual 'baddies'. Liked the fact the woman is the diplomat and her husband an ex diplomat. The staff around them all great. British politicians played by great actors too and are not stereotypes.",literal
"Dark escapism with a shattering message at its core Two working class cousins, one of them a highly motivated activist and the younger one being mentally challenged, live in squalor together in Atlanta. The activist cousin, embracing intergalactic conspiracy theories, devises a highly quixotic kidnapping scheme in which the CEO of a prominent biochemical company is the target. He and his cousin undertake this puzzling endeavor. A genteel and majestic soundtrack belies the film's most seedy surroundings.

Jesse Plemons is raggedly creepy and pitiable as the kidnapping mastermind. Emma Stone is fierce as the brilliant CEO who doesn't roll over for her captors. Aidan Delbis is exceptional as the simple-minded cousin who becomes a mere mercenary. Stavros Halkias is effective as a good-natured but diligent local cop. An intertwining theme of class warfare and emotional bullying is starkly evident in the scenes between Plemons and Stone.

Yorgos Lanthimos can surprise his audience no matter what his approach is or the scale of his ambition. Here, just when you think you know where Lanthimos is going, his film becomes genre-bending and takes on new significance and an angle that we didn't see coming. To be sure, Lanthimos ultimately reinforces his clinical perspective, but in a way that subverts our expectations. Notwithstanding this mountain of misery and excess, the film does take moments to express wonder. After this, I might never look at honeybees the same way again. Highly recommended to viewers with thick skin and an open mind.",literal
"Please stay on the air.... Absolutely one of the most ground breaking bad ass shows on the screen, (pardon the pun). Definitely not for everyone but finally something that feels real.

I personally like the fact they pull no punches. I find myself pausing at the fact that I am so intrigued by this hard core street wise program, more than any of the other big name series. This one really hits home and gives a true behind the scenes look at what most would consider the bad guys. I'm not condoning the contents of the story, and I don't think the show is either, there is no glamor in what these boys are doing, but it's giving an insight to the darker side of many streets. 

How the denial and desperation that can occur to the common working stand up citizen, the pillar of society that suddenly changes his moral standing in a society driven by the almighty dollar. This is pretty dam close to Fallen (Michel Douglas) but with up to date street smarts nd a lot more punch. 

The characters don't over exaggerate their roles and the story line isn't filled with cleaver dialog or near to impossible feats of bravery or beating impossible odds. Just true to life screwed up events that could take place in the real world. I think they did their research on this one. Good work everyone. 

I hope we get more than a second and third season out of this great crew (every one of them). From the writing and production sets to the acting, costumes, lighting, filming and originality. I've seen a few good series lost to the wrong decision makers, hope this one doesn't end up short (long live FireFly)

"Quite enjoyable, would have worked better as a series It is good, but as the film progressed I started noticing how things didn't add up.

First of all, as usual per Netflix, they release a film with a story that clearly would have been better if it was released as a series.

That is because, despite Zoey and Mira being protagonists of this film, we do not see that much character development for them, still better than the other members from the Saja Boys that are early on hinted to have personalities - like the dude with the abs -, only for them to barely speak again later on.

So we are left with the both ""main characters"" Rumi and Jinu, so why is Rumi's character development so broken? As in, why does it feel like elements to properly develop and conclude her character are missing? Jinu on the other hand, despite having a simple premise, is properly delivered.

By the way, talking about Rumi, why does Celine (her foster mother and mentor) only showed up in the last third of the film? And we have Rumi say a cliche line such as ""why didn't you love me?"", are you for real? You are working as a Demon Hunter despite being a demon, isn't this the best approach for this situation?

Something else that slipped my mind, but I had to edit and mention is, so they are stealing their fans' souls and the news say ""thrice the amount of people are missing"", so how does these numbers add up? People are missing, are the Korean police so incompetent to connect those people missing are literally connected by the Saja Boys? Also, how do they fill a stadium if they keep on stealing souls and don't do it in one go?

As for the voice acting, it is so weird because I considered watching this in Korean, because I heard a comparison video between English, Korean and Japanese and, for immersion, I thought Korean would be the better choice, but I ended up watching in English, but I do reckon each language had their better approaches. What I disliked about the English dub was how the voice singing, except for Jinu, don't match their acting voice (not talking about the other Saja Boys, as I said, they barely speak).

The art is very nice, but the animation felt like was missing frames? Kinda like it was a bit choppy?

In the end, my pet peeve was that this should have been a series, properly develop the other two girls and the Saja Boys. Throw the conscription male idols go through and the Saja Boys, being demons, are that much better than actual soldiers so they are released; have both groups interact with those variety programs old geezers are there and they do stuff only they find it funny and people awkwardly laugh, there was so much they could do, SPECIALLY this being a western animation, you would never see a Korean animation mocking those things because their society is too rigid, they would take that jab as something offensive and not something to just laugh it off.",literal
"Sandlot of Dreams Passionate about baseball, a middle aged man fondly recalls the summer when he first learned how to play, the friends he made and the mischief they got up to in this popular comedy. While there are some funny moments to be had and the kids interact with one another credibly, the first half of 'The Sandlot' is difficult to get through at times with lots of excessively sentimental voice over narration and several silly shenanigans. The second half of the film is a blast though as a lost ball over a fence brings out the kids' creative sides. The inventions they come up with to retrieve the ball (without disturbing the dog in the yard) are delightfully wacky and inventive, especially a souped-up vacuum cleaner. The second half also features a chase sequence done with unexpected originality (if still the odd heavily telegraphed gag). Suffice it to say, footage from 'The Wolf Man' has rarely been appropriated so well. It has been said that 'The Sandlot' is the type of film that will only appeal to baseball lovers and those who like reminiscing about their youth. It is true that those from these demographics will likely get more from the film, but the project is still probably worth a look for others. The annoying voice-over does disappear for certain stretches and uneven as the first 45 minutes may well be, everything picks up once the kids get to show off their ingenuity.",literal
"Not A Bad Adaptation Except where were the crowds watching?

Masculinity, violence, death, the military and the American Way!!

The major and his make this Country Number one again. I don't remember that bit in the novella.

What does come though is the stupidness of young men. It won't be me. I'll be fine. The one writing a book, the one talking about what he will do with his money,

None of them stop to consider how executing 49 boys a year helps the economy.

5000 a year maybe, then eventually there might be less unemployment at least unskilled labour anyway.

But then it has always been pretty easy to convince people that dying - of course - others, not themselves personally - is the way to having a great world.

This no different.

Over the top! Thats what it reminds me of, and the Captains standing behind ready to shoot the poor bl**dy infantry if they didn't.

And why did they volunteer in the first place.

"Best work Sly has ever done I was absolutely blown away by this show. Its absolutely brilliant. Sly Stalone is truly awesome in this series. Sly if you are reading this and I hope may some day you do, take a bow sir. You are so good in this role. I would be seriously shocked if you don't receive high accolades for this performance. In fact I would br extremely disappointed if you don't get the recognition you truly deserve. I never write reviews generally but was compelled to do so in this instance. In fact the whole casting was very well chosen by the casting director. All of the characters and the roles were superb. Bravo. Also Fingers crossed for series 2.",figurative
"So far, so good! Only 6 episodes out so far, but so far so good! It very much feels like a spiritual successor to the tried and true workplace mockumentary shows like the office and parks and rec while still feeling original in its jokes and characters. The characters here are likable, distinct, and well developed. The humor rides a nice line of not always playing it safe while not going overboard to be intentionally offense. Great shows like the aforementioned office and parks and rec had relatively rough starts. St Denis seems to have hit the ground at least ""jogging"" if not totally running, and I think it's lead up to a very promising start to the type of sitcom many people (including me) love. I'm looking forward to more!",figurative
"Band of Idiots One of the worst movies ever. The United States apparently cannot shoot down a single missile. After launching 2 missiles that fail, the US military is apparently out of options. Every person seems like they've had no training and this is the first day on the job; basic communications can barely be established; everyone seems more focused on calling a love one or going outside for a mental breakdown. After enduring this disaster, there is no ending.",literal
"Overhyped I'm surprised by all the ""fantastic"" reviews on this movie. It's definitely an ok film but in no way is this a 10/10 movie. It's a slow burn and then it goes into character POV, which is really unnecessary. It's too long and there are unanswered questions. I wasn't rooting for any of the characters except the ending scene (and you'll know what I'm talking about). So it's really just average. It could have been so much more. I'll never watch it again but I'm not upset that I saw it.",literal
"My new favorite show I don't remember the last time I watched a show that genuinely made me laugh out loud (and multiple times an episode). Everything about this show is perfect in my eyes, from the writing, to the acting, production, sound design, everything. It gives me a very comforting feeling watching it and I would sell a kidney to be able to get a 2nd and 3rd season.",literal
"Visually appealing, but unnecessary sluggish This movie, about Elphaba and Galinda who become friends at Shiz University in the Land of Oz, is an okay fairy tale movie.

It is one of the most hyped and popular movies of recent years, and I had somewhat high expectations. The movie is visually appealing in terms of production design, costumes, and makeup, delivering musical and artistic performances and touches, and it proves itself how much work that has been put into it.

However, although I found the first act to be promising, the rest of the movie increasingly falters in telling its story in an appealing way, I think. Ariana Grande fills her character as the protagonist Elphaba's friend Galinda surprisingly enough, but I do not think Cynthia Erivo (as Elphaba) deserves an Oscar nomination. Erivo did alright, but nothing outstanding. The movie has a runtime of 162 minutes, and together with the first act, which I enjoyed, the movie feels like a grand-scaled one, reminding me a bit of The Harry Potter Octalogy (2001-2011), Barbie (2023), and The School for Good and Evil (2022), but after this act, the movie is surprisingly slow, barely developing the story at some points. It makes much room for the musical parts, which are not bad, but to me they could have been shorter or fewer. The movie did not appeal to me as much as I expected, unfortunately.

In conclusion, this movie shines visually but falters in storytelling. Despite strong production design and performances, the narrative loses momentum after a promising start. Ariana Grande impresses as Galinda, while Erivo's Elphaba feels unremarkable. At 162 minutes, the movie prioritizes musical numbers over plot, making it feel sluggish. Ultimately, it does not live up to its hype.",figurative
"Not What I Was Hoping For Ever since I became familiar with the story of Garfield's assassination, I hoped someone would make a movie. Someone like Del Toro or Scorsese or Fincher. There is a 'Taxi Driver' kind of insanity to Guiteau. And the backdrop of the corrupt New York Customs House.

Death By Lightening ruins a squalid American horror story. It is not compelling.",literal

Finally some quality entertainment The bar is low these days and normally I would give this closer to a 7 but I'm grading on a curve. Well done throughout and a good throw back to vintage HBO. I don't know what some of these reviewers were even watching that rated this poorly. I'm guessing they are the same ones rating the regular garbage so high.,literal
"Infiltration and Intrigue A Man on the Inside"" is a comedy mystery series on Netflix, crafted by Michael Schur. Inspired by the Chilean documentary ""The Mole Agent,"" Michael Schur adapted its intriguing premise into this series. Ted Danson stars as a retired professor seeking new excitement in his life when he answers an advertisement from a private investigator. Lilac Richcreek portrays the investigator who tasks Ted with infiltrating a nursing home in San Francisco to uncover the mystery of a missing necklace, a cherished possession of one of the residents. Stephanie Beatriz takes on the role of Didi, the nursing home's manager, while Mary Elizabeth Ellis plays Ted's daughter, residing in Sacramento with her family of three boys.

The ensemble of elderly characters includes Sally Struthers, John Getz, Lori Tan Chinn as the board president, Clyde Kusatsu, Margaret Avery, Veronica Cartwright, and Susan Ruttan. Nelson Franklin is featured as the owner of the nursing home, and Marc Evan Jackson as the son who enlists Lilac's services. The series presents a delightful and engaging story with endearing characters that resonate with viewers. There's a hopeful anticipation for a second season to continue this charming narrative.",literal
"Odette makes it worth watching Usually I am not a fan of real life Husband and Wife or couples playing romantic partners on screen but in this movie it's alright. Odette and Dave Annable are the leads in this rom com about 2 people having trouble sleeping not sex, except when they are together. Always have been a fan of Odette. Dave should dye his hair black - the premature grey ages him unnecessarily.

The acting and dialogue are better than the average Christmas movie.",literal
"Schwarzenegger's Hunger Games In the dystopian future of 2017, all media is controlled by the state. Their most popular TV show is ""Running Man"", a game show where convicts fight against American Gladiator style warriors known as ""Stalkers"". If the contestants are able to escape with their lives, then they are granted their freedom. After being framed for a crime he didn't commit, Schwarzenegger's Ben Richards is entered into this competition.

Of course, not all the ""futuristic"" technology holds up, but the commentary they make on media is still surprisingly relevant to this day.

The movie is vintage Arnold. It came out the same year as ""Predator"" and has him doing the action and spouting all the one-liners as only Arnold can. There is a definite cheesy charm to it. With all his quips, the title of the film could have been ""The Punning Man"".",figurative
"Good drama, but filled with liberal propaganda I really like the show for the storyline and it is well done as far as production value, acting, stories, and entertainment value.

In order to enjoy the show you have to get by CBS's woke agenda that is blatantly baked into every episode. It's actually insulting at times to think they believe I'm going to sit here and be subconsciously influenced by this.

But like I said, I can stomach that because the show is pretty decent. I'm more forgiving than most people though and expect the show will fold because of this eventually.",literal
"It tries and fails The comedy is rarely funny. And the characters are impossible to feel anything for. Nothing about any of them makes me feel any connection whatsoever. I literally don't care what happens to any of them. A couple are just plain annoying. Maybe too it's a hospital setting and the characters are so inept. Just a sitcom, but stupidity in a retail store (Superstore) or city hall (Parks & Rec) can be funny. In a hospital it just seems oddly wrong. Maybe would have been better set in an urgent care with sniffles and stitches.

They tried to recreate Superstore and / or Parks and Rec. Failed.

Probably a 1 season wonder.",literal
"Entertaining spectacle I had a fun time with this film. It's honestly worth watching just for the big reveal, as with all magic shows. The reveal is shocking, but does make you question some of the logistics involved the more you think about it. Oh well. Now You See Me is still highly enjoyable with plenty of tricks up its sleeves.",literal
"The finale was a literal disaster The finale was so flawed, made the characters look like strangers to the fans, i couldn't believe they would make it this bad. So many questions unanswered.. It really left a bad taste. For how emotionally invested the show makes you be, the ending is just a tragedy to watch on so many different levels.",literal
"Pretty Good Movie Rating - 7.4: Overall, a valiant effort for a directorial debut as Chris Stuckmann shows his potential as a filmmaker with captivating storytelling and ominous world-building, but the movie suffers from issues you would expect from a new indie filmmaker with its amateurish cinematography, cheap visual effects, and an inability to stick the landing because the final 5 minutes ruin this movie's chance of being something special; I hope Stuckmann can parlay this into making bigger budget movies as he shows potential as a filmmaker, but hopefully he uses his budget wisely because it is obvious Neon wasted the increased budget on cheap CGI and unnecessary reshoots.

Direction - Pretty Good to Good: The direction on a macroscale is built well, as they create this ominous mystery in a demented world; I really enjoyed how they weaved the documentary and found footage into the movie; I felt the filmmaking style in the dramatic moments felt a little amateurish with how it looked, which makes sense because this is a directorial debut; The direction on a microscale is pretty good, as you can really empathize with their struggle to find her sister; The storytelling is good for the majority of the movie, as they create a mystery that slowly unravels, but keeps you engaged, as you want to see how things play out; I was not a fan of how the storytelling was in the last five minutes; Tension is built well, as you are emotionally invested in these characters, so you feel on edge when something bad happens to them

Story - Pretty Good to Good: The concept is good, as it's a missing girl mystery that weaves in found footage elements to give it a Blair Witch feel, and the conflict is presented in a way that it doesn't give away too much, but at least gives you a why for why things are happening; The plot structure is good for the most part, as the movie feels like a good mystery that slowly unravels the more you try to solve the disappearance, though the resolution wasn't that great, as it felt forced; Character writing is good, as you get a sense of the protagonist's struggle trying to find her sister and the world they live in affecting them; The character writing is critical in helping connect with the protagonist's struggle, as you feel invested in her trying to find closure

Screenplay - Pretty Good to Good: The dialogue is sharp for the most part, nothing super outstanding; the symbolism is very strong, as the movie touches on issues of loss and grief as well as pagan and found footage supernatural tropes; the foreshadowing is strong in the movie, as it helps the protagonist try to solve the mystery

Acting - Pretty Good: Camille Sullivan - Pretty Good to Good (The star of the show, she shows a wide range of emotions and is the emotional core for this movie; we experience this mystery through her eyes as she is motivated to find her lost sister after 12 years), Brendan Sexton III - Pretty Bad (Honestly, it feels very stiff and doesn't have chemistry with Sullivan), Robin Bartlett - Decent to Pretty Good (Plays a real sinister character, but doesn't have much time to work with), Sarah Dunn - Pretty Good (Really shows a wide range of emotions as she really embodies the character and feels like what the lead of Blair Witch Project should have been), Keith David - Pretty Good (Feels like he was a part of the reshoots, but he does a pretty good job and has chemistry in the one scene he is in), Rest of the cast - Decent (A pretty small cast, but what you would expect from a low-budget horror movie)

Score - Decent: Helps with building tension

Cinematography - Decent: Cinematography in the documentary and found footage moments was really good and weaved well into the movie; when they switched to a traditional camera, it felt pretty amateurish and not that appealing, which makes sense because it is a low budget directorial debut

Editing - Decent: Editing for the found footage and documentary clips was pretty cool, as it made the movie feel like a mockumentary, but the rest of the movie just felt kind of bland in terms of editing

Sound - Pretty Good: Feels amplified to help heighten tension and make you feel scared of what is going on

Visual Effects - Bad: It felt very cheap, and it was obvious it was added when the budget was increased

Production Design - Pretty Good: Help create this pagan, ominous world of the abandoned Shelby Oaks

Makeup - Decent to Pretty Good: Helps show the impact of the hauntings

Pacing - Pacing is fine for the most part as the movie goes at the right pace

Climax - The climax is good and well executed, and the ending was a big let down as it basically felt like they threw away everything they built up to

Tone - Tone was a mystery and a found footage film combined; I would have really liked to see them continue the documentary style throughout the movie

Final Notes - Saw press screening at Fantastic Fest; Met Chris Stuckmann after the movie.",literal
"Just wait. The first 3 episodes were hard to watch. Really stressful. Decided to keep watching and I'm glad I did.

Love the settings and clothes. The props department should definitely get an award. Such class.

This is the first thing I've seen Ricky Matin in. He does such a good job. Really enjoyed his character. So lovable.

Carol Burnett is an American treasure and I love her in this. She's sharp as a tack and absolutely gorgeous.

Kristin Wig is also great. I love how she is able to sneak in some of her corky humor.

"Great substitute for a sleeping pill. I watched this garbage because it was recommended by a friend. I had written the title on a scrap of paper. Now I wish I could remember who recommended it so I'll know never to take his/her advice ever again.

I kept wanting to abort, but something would tell me surely it's nearly over, so I might as well see how it ends...But it never ends! It just drags on and on and on until you feel like ripping your hair out by the roots. I was cursing the unknown jerk that told me to watch it and I'm now convinced that whoever-it-was must have done it as a joke, or maybe as punishment or revenge for some horrible crime I may have commited.

So, unless you're into watching a lot of French sissies running around in the woods pretending to be badasses, be warned to stay away from this abortion.",literal
One of the Messiest Films of the Year... Average Execution One does give Playdate credit that where it heads is nowhere near where one would expect - but it doesn't mean it's the right path. Bryan Greenfield literally is throwing everything at the story - some of which works and at times it's really making no sense. Kevin James seems as lost as the audience. And what was the point of Isla Fisher in this movie? This feels like a sticky taped Amazon action flick.,literal
"Better than the usual Slop Basically a Doc Sportello Inherent Vice private eye vibe to Ethan Hawkes character. Playing JJ Cale to start the series is whats keeping me locked in so far. Other Oklahoma based artists are featured throughout, which is a nice touch. Sterlin Harjo can make the story feel very lived in already as he did with Reservation Dogs. This show feels like it was made for certain people and you'll either love it or hate depending on your personality. Go watch Mekko by Harjo. It's another Tulsa based story.",literal
"What could have been When one watches a period piece, it is necessary for the viewer to be immersed totally in the time and place. This show succeeds in this with via costumes, settings and dialogue as well as very good performances from the cast. But then, one is jolted out of the drama by musical accompaniments totally inappropriate to the period. So no longer is the viewer engulfed in the period and the drama, but wrenched out of it by a rap song or a folk song and that becomes not only an annoyance, but a serious detriment to one's enjoyment of the program. I did watch all 8 episodes and i enjoyed the story, but I will not be returning for season 2, despite the cliffhanger ending, unless or until someone on the creative team addresses the inappropriate music.",literal
"Actually not very novel or well done I came in with high expectations, as I was very impressed with Barbarian. Not so much! While not entirely predictable (no spoilers!), this plot feels like a rehash of familiar tropes. I can appreciate leaning into tropes, especially in horror, but this just doesn't deliver the depth I was hoping for. The twist at the end is brief fun but this film kind of drags, particularly if you were hoping for some sort of genius breakthrough in filmmaking. Totally over-rated in my view.",literal
"The most intense and complicated characters ever written. Better Call Saul was misunderstood at beginning. Some of the people were saying nonsense things. Some of them expected a TV show that similiar to Breaking Bad. It's definelty not similiar and it can't be.

The under-rated first season was quite an openning with its amazing twist. They build the most intense and complicated characters in this TV serie. Vince Gilligan is just brilliant at writing complicated characters. Characters even those who you hate are written perfectly, just like in Breaking Bad.

Every season characters evolving even slower. Every season adds a value to all the characters, adds a value and meaning to their purpose of actions. You're realizing even the characters from Breaking Bad wasn't complete. You're realizing, you just learnt characters motivation.

Can you imagine a complex character like Walter White, Saul Goodman, Chuck McGill, Gustavo Fring? I bet you can't find many.

Screenplay and Acting Performances are just brilliant. But also the technical details are in Better Call Saul is pretty amazing.

Cinematography is just perfect, amazingly done, so beautiful shots.

Film Editing is also so underrated in this show. Film Editing is so good. They know when to cut the scene, they know how to transfer the scene to the audience.

Costume Design is also quite good. Thanks to the costume designer, once again represents the characters motivation at the time.

Makeup is also quite good, you can't fix that easily the aging problem. I think they've managed a good job, I don't know if could it be better.",figurative
"So good Cinematography and the depth of the scene is amazing. This scene alone could win awards. The use of silence, light, and space - everything works together so naturally. It's like watching a short film inside a show. I really recommend this show, you can really feel the passion behind every shot. Super cool.",literal
"An outrage to King's vision, but enjoyable nonetheless I've read the Stephen King story about 5 times, and this movie does not follow the fable, even vaguely. But that does not make it a bad movie. In King's version, Schwarzenegger's character is a skinny, intense and relentless character, a person with integrity that surpasses all expectations and vigor, in a Dystopian world. In King's version, the protagonist is ""every man,"" just an average Joe who is lucky enough to be elected for the ""Running Man"" game show. He runs and runs and runs and kicks some serious a--. Unfortunately in the movie, it's all about Arnold getting revenge. But this doesn't make it a bad movie, just one that is a betrayal to the passion and the voice of the original story. In this regard, the movie is a fraud, and yet, it is enjoyable in the heyday of Arnold's magnificence.",literal

Definitely will be ""grabbing"" the blu-ray copy. It's so worth it along with the first film.",literal
"'Weapons' Lacks Substance and Big Flaws I'll give the pros and cons.

Pros: 'Weapons' maintains suspense in the first half pretty well. The acting is good (as it usually would be for such a high-budget film), and it has some unique shots. Sorry, that's all I got.

Cons: I really don't like bashing films (any film) because I know it takes a long time and a lot of hard work to make even a bad movie, let alone a good or great one. However, this film had several flaws.

Ensemble Cast: Having an ensemble cast can be a significant advantage or a major drawback. In this case, it was a considerable drawback because the plot was convoluted due to the presence of too many subplots competing for attention. We don't really get to know any of the characters or their motivations well; we're only given snippets about them. Justine is a drunk who cares too much about kids, Paul is a cop who commits adultery and has contamination OCD (maybe?), Archer wants his kid back (yup, that's all), and Gladys is an evil witch who traps Alex under her thumb. I don't feel that characters have to be 'likable,' necessarily, but they have to be interesting.

Setups & Payoffs: Having 17 kids run away from their homes at the same moment in the middle of the night is a BIG setup. However, if you have a big setup, you need a big payoff, and this film definitely did not deliver one. What is behind this great big mystery?... An old, dying witch. Done. Wouldn't it have been much more interesting if there was something bigger that Gladys had planned? If the stakes were raised? What if she were part of a larger coven that was planning to take over the entire town? Maybe more? Nope, she's just an old evil witch we know nothing about.

Lack of Authorities: Although they did show some cops and special agents interviewing Alex and other people during a montage and a few quick scenes, the number of local police/FBI/DOJ/DOS/HSI, etc. Would be overwhelming in this case; they wouldn't simply let it go as the unseen narrator tells us. A good story should be kept as private as possible to the world that the writer creates. However, limiting the world to only a handful of characters hurts the credibility of this particular story; the small, fictional town of Maybrook, Pennsylvania, should have been more deeply involved in the plot. The authorities would have searched every inch of that town (and beyond) and found at least one clue that would have led to at least one (if not more) of those seventeen children. After however many months, it took Archer, acting alone, to finally review someone else's doorbell camera footage and obtain a map, until he finally discovered that Alex's house was where the problem had been all along. The authorities would have known this very early on and figured out where the kids were. Lazy writing!

The Rules of the Story World: Not only does the writer not have to explain everything to the audience, but they shouldn't. However, when a writer creates rules within a unique world (especially in this genre), they must define them to a certain extent. Gladys's way of bewitching people was clear enough. She needs water, a bowl, her blood, a tree twig, and something her victim possesses? Hair too? Both? Kind of confusing. In the end, Alex casts his own spell on Gladys and has the kids literally rip her apart. But how did he do that? Can anyone just grab the necessary items and go to work? It would have been much better if there had been a chant or something more specific that Gladys did, which Alex perhaps witnessed by accident, allowing him to cast the final spell. Also, how was Gladys 'feeding' off these kids? They were just standing around when the crackhead found them. Why didn't Glady's put Alex under the spell once she had all those children? Where were Gladys and Alex going right before Archer and Justine found the house near the end? Too many open questions.

Finally, some of the shots and coloring appear slightly off. I know that is very technical, but I noticed it. Also, the pacing was slow and muddled at times, especially in the second half.",figurative
"Incredible film that deserves all the awards! I want to say this film isn't just for lovers of this genre like myself. I love and have seen most every movie/show/documentary possible related to WW2. My girlfriend who went with me loves movies, but doesn't really seek out this genre.

I want to say I absolutely loved this movie, as did she!

The character performances from Russell and Rami were second to none. The supporting cast was also exceptional.

My girlfriend and I got dinner and drinks after the show and this movie dominated the conversation.

I honestly do not want to spoil any of this movie, I just highly suggest you go see it. It's powerful, informative, mysterious, entertaining, unnerving and so so much more.

I hope this movie gets all of the accolades it rightfully deserves and I hope you enjoy it as much as we did!",literal
"John Hughes scraping bottom... Comic book junk concerns two teenage boys who invent a busty, sexy brunette with their home-computer, resulting in hormone-crazed chaos. What might've been a likably goofy slapstick ride has become a tasteless, witless affair aimed at sniggering juveniles. It is far worse than the usual sex-related teen shenanigans, which not even Anthony Michael Hall's affable charm can rescue. Kelly LeBrock, with her pouty lips and deep, guttural laugh, is definitely game, but she's used as a sight-gag, a prop, and Hughes can't even work up a genuine character for her to play. Even for low-rent tastes, the movie is swill, and staggeringly unfunny. NO STARS from ****",literal
"The closer you look, the less you see As a magician myself, I love films that look in to a magicians world, The Prestige being one of my favorite films so Now You See Me really interested me. And in terms of showmanship and effects, it delivers, its a huge magical spectacle, but, just like the best of magic effects, the closer you look the less you see. 

This film is all style and no substance. The characters are all paper thin, nothings clear about why they do anything they do, even at the end where we are given a conclusion that stretches your disbelief so far, that the mystery is shattered by just how far down the rabbit hole they go to try and fool you into thinking what you just saw was magic, when really, it was just a huge con job.

Overall, The spectacle of the show is what kept me involved, It made me smile because, even as a magician, the film feels like magic, it loves how it presents magic and thats what magic is about, presentation.",literal
"Original Horror Is Back!!!!!!!!!!! For all the idiots and those who do not know how to appreciate a horror movie as such and only rate 1 star just for a reason that makes no sense, they think they have the opinion, surely they did not even finish watching the movie, it is very good, THE THEME of terror of doing with acts and bringing together all the stories of several key characters in the story, it was very good, the movie is very interesting and to watch horror movies of all kinds of being 10 years old until now with 24 it is a movie based on an original story, showing part of what witchcraft would be with the spiritual world and that it is represented as a weapon is good, because IF YOU WATCH THE MOVIE AND LISTEN TO THE SCRIPT LPQTP, THEY RUN LIKE BALAAAS, so nothing, I hope and I HOPE a sequel to that old witch, I get very into the role and the movies, so nothing, a fight with that old woman, thank you very much.",literal
"Pretty good with a lot of potential I'm giving it 7 because from the pilot it has a lot of potential, and hopefully will mature nicely. Some bits were very very funny, some bits tried hard but weren't funny. 

The son and husbands characters need to be refined because they were not quite there, but Laura Linney was very good and plays the lead role well. The the emotion and reactions seemed believable, i hope that it doesn't try and jam morals down the viewers throat (eg. scrubs) because it is clever enough to do more than that.

I'm going to watch the next one with interest and hope it goes up to a 9/10.",literal
"When key characters are replaced, you are playing with fire (Spoilers) I was watching some episodes of Season 12 when I noticed the absence of Thomas Gibson. The story line that he is not coming back sounded a little strange. Then I read here all sorts of pros and cons on the firing of Thomas. Surprisingly enough, and coming from ""pros"" is that CBS/ABC Studios seem to have only taken a look at a little corner instead of the entire picture.

I have watched each and every episode of the entire series since Season 1 and one of the strengths of CM is the great chemistry that existed between the cast members. Sure, some agents came and went but that was OK because the main characters were always there. The resignation of Mandy Patinkin was a hard kick in the main structure of the show but, thankfully, Rossi's arrival ""fixed"" it.

Then, Shemar Moore left and you could tell there was some kind of gap somewhere. Now, Thomas Gibson was fired and swiftly replaced by Paget Brewster. What is a very weak link here is the fact that Emily Prentiss has been working for Interpol for awhile and she was over in pursuit of a criminal. Realistically, agencies like the FBI don't simply grab an agent from another agency PLUS puts him/her in charge of a division. There is something called courtesy between agencies of allied countries. It would have made a lot more sense, since Rossi did not want the position, to give it to JJ, a regular field agent with seniority from the beginning.

A structure can only take some many kicks to its heart before it crumbles. Ratings are unfortunately weakening, fans are boycotting it and Season 13 is a huge question mark. The stupid CBS/ABC Studios and their executives should have thought of that instead of their idiotic macho pride. Sometimes ""pros"" do not stand up to their title.",figurative
"It's perfect It was perfect. Edgar Wright nailed on this expensive movie. The action, everything. A lot better than the 1987. It follows the book. Glen Powell did a great Job on playing the character Ben Richards. This film feels like a big mix of Fast and Furios and Mission: Impossible. I love the chase scenes.",literal
"Interesting depiction of little-known period in American history Until I watched this miniseries I only knew that James Garfield was one of the four assassinated presidents. I knew nothing of the assassin or that Garfield was an ""accidental"" nominee in 1880.

I generally enjoy historical dramas and this one is pretty solid- until the viewer is suddenly jolted out of the 19th century by dialogue that almost certainly wouldn't have been used back then.

Examples: At the Republican nominating convention someone on the stage angrily yells ""motherf*cker"" to the crowd. Later, Garfield's wife tells her husband that people are ""on the lawn"" outside their Ohio farmhouse.

Much of the script uses very formal language even in casual settings, which may be unrealistic but is more easily forgiven.",literal
How? How did this script make it past the FIRST read? Im so sad for Bob. What a terrible film. Just ...terrible. I actually want my money back. Im so angry I paid for this nonsense. I guess thats the bonus of watching something in the theater...you can leave and ask for your money back. The first film was pretty damn good. Was hoping for more of that.,literal
"It just doesn't work Much to my surprise Kenneth Branagh's adaptation is better, for the sake of a quick comparison. There are aspects of this that are fine. It looks good, at times, but is lacking a significant amount of emotional heft. Certain characters missing, Justine for example, and the trajedy surrounding her, and a more global justification for the monster's motivations, in terms of it having been universally condemned, rather than by only Victor and a random encounter with a particular group.

Some of the visuals are good, but there's something a little too clean and plastic about it all. Would suggest avoiding 4k actually.

I also have concerns about the creature's design, rather more like the Engineer, as revealed in Prometheus, with a few big scars, rather more than Frankenstein's monster.

It's a shame, but there we go. In fact, among many less than sucessful adaptations.",literal
"One of the Better National Lampoon Films The Griswold family's plans for a big family Christmas predictably turn into a big disaster.

How do you beat this? Frank Capra III helping to direct, John Hughes writing and Angelo Badalamenti on the score? There is no way these three folks could make a bad movie. Then throw in Chevy Chase, Brian Murray, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Bill Hickey and Randy Quaid... you have an instant classic.

I could maybe have done without Juliette Lewis. I mean, she has her moments, but how did she get to be in this film? Being the daughter of Geoffrey Lewis? It certainly was not her work being Wayne's girlfriend on ""The Wonder Years"". Oh well. At least she went on to do better things.

Today, the film is considered a modern Christmas classic, and I would have to agree. It also is a strong third entry in the franchise, second only to the original. Ebert wrote, ""The movie is curious in how close it comes to delivering on its material: Sequence after sequence seems to contain all the necessary material, to be well on the way toward a payoff, and then it somehow doesn't work."" I have to say, I think he was wrong.",literal
"Fun for kids, entertaining for adults, excellent for baseball enthusiasts. ""The Sandlot"" is a charming kids film that over the last 15 years has gained somewhat of a cult following, making this a nostalgic joy for 25 year old's who remember seeing this at age 10 and laughing their heads off. To me, this is not a perfect family film, but unlike many movies that claim to be family films, this actually is a ""FAMILY FILM"". Kids like it for the relate able situations and amusing dialogue between the kids, adults will find it's very easy to get wrapped up in this, even though it is just a silly kiddie movie and anyone in between will probably enjoy this too.

Scotty has just moved to a new neighborhood, and isn't accepted by the other children. Eventually, he begins playing baseball with them at the local sandlot, and several adventures come from this. The main story is Scotty losing his step dad's (Dennis Leary) signed Babe Ruth baseball in the backyard with an evil dog the kids refer to as ""The Beast"".

This movie has some genuinely amusing scenes, and some scenes so campy, they're hilarious. One scene involves a young boys plan to make out with the attractive older girl lifeguard at the public pool, and this scene is kind of a classic, which may be seen in movies after or even before this, but it was just done so great here. Any scene involving ""The Beast"" is hilarious. Depending on the scene, this dog changes shape and size, and can be anything from a large dog to some kind of mutated super monster. This dog puts the shark in Jaws to shame. It's good the kids each have their own distinct personalities, and aren't entirely run on stereotypes. One small problem is the lack of any emotional conflict, which may or may not be a problem depending on your point of view. I would have liked something to tug at the audiences' heart strings, but nothing does. It's still a good movie however.

Overall, this is a fun movie for all...not great, but good enough to be enjoyed by the whole family.

"One star to bring the show back to a normal rating There is no way this show is a 10, 9 or even an 8 out of 10. Something feels off about the reviews and ratings. The people giving it glowing scores must not have watched many good shows. After three episodes, it is a decent show at best, around 7 out of 10, and that is being generous. I gave it a 1 to balance things out. These ratings make me question the whole system. If this show is a 9 or 10, then The Sopranos, Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul and Severance should be rated 100 out of 10.",literal
"Phenomenal show, honestly. 10/10 If you're looking for an action packed show with dozens of ups and downs in one family, this is the show for you. Me and my partner loved each and every episode from season 1 all the way to season 6. It has a mix of crude humor, things no family should do (but this show gets away with), and each episode slowly leads up to a bizarre end that no one sees coming. This show truly is a 10/10, and you'll find yourself following each character through this crazy family mob story. Don't snooze, 10/10! You won't find yourself getting bored, only wondering how it will all end up and seeking Justice for even the smallest characters in this family mob drama.",literal
"This might be the worst Christmas movie ever Talk about one of the worst Christmas movies of all time. The only thing this movie portrayed is a Christmas town and an idea of Christmas. Other than that, you could not pick a worse of cast of main characters. The whole 'hallmark' style of movie is completely butchered. You would never wish two people to never be together more than you would watching this movie. The only way this movie could be better is if they actually stayed with their opposite matches. Save yourself the time and energy and effort of watching. Trust me.",literal
"Superb adaptation a homage to Old Hollywood My Review -

Guillermo del Toro's Frankenstein In Cinemas now My Rating. 10/10

I recently lamented about the quality and attention to detail and originality that some obviously not all contemporary movie directors and screenwriters display today.

Oscar winning director Mexican director Guillermo Del Toro's work has always been a showcase for creativity, originality and attention to detail.

His admiration and inspiration is obvious for his favourite directors that include Alfred Hitchcock Sergio Leone, Akira Kurosawa, Stanley Kubrick ,Martin Scorsese and James Whale who inspired his love of the horror genre.

James Whale in 1931 directed Boris Karloff as the monster in Frankenstein and now 94 years later it's Guillermo Del Toro's turn.

Guillermo del Toro decided to follow up his version of Pinocchio (2022), with the ""Frankenstein"" story that he has always viewed as two sides of the same conceptual coin.

I agree the concepts are identical whether a wooden puppet turns into a real boy or an ego crazed doctor creates a monster by experimenting with the power of life force.

Both Pinocchio and The Monster discover the cruelty and abuse of humanity .

We all know or have seen different adaptations of British author Mary Shelley's gothic 1818 novel Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus .

Guillermo Del Torro who successfully achieves the movie Trifecta of Producer, Director and Screenwriter has remained largely faithful to Mary Shelley's novel in a similar way to Danny Boyle's superb 2011 stage production for The National Theatre that starred Benedict Cumberbatch and Jonny Lee Miller who alternated the roles of Victor Frankenstein and The Monster.

Australian actor Jacob Elordi gives a sensational performance as the monster and brings such emotion and gentleness to a role that transcends horror and violence.

I read that he was not the first choice to play The Monster ,Andrew Garfield was originally cast as the Monster, but had to drop out due to scheduling conflicts.

I think it was a brilliant choice to have one of the most handsome male actors today play the cruelly deformed monster.

In the most demanding role of his career Jacob Elordi says he loved playing the role and spent up to ten hours in the makeup chair for extensive makeup application .

Some days he arrived at the makeup trailer at 10 P. M. and stayed up all night.

To quote Guillermo del Toro ""he came to believe Elordi was ""superhuman"". ""Never once did he come to me and complain. ""Never once did he come to me and say, 'I'm tired. I'm hungry. Can I go?' And he put in 20-hour days."" From the first frames of this movie I felt it was a nostalgic affectionate homage to the Golden age of Hollywood movies the director insisted on elaborate studio built sets rather relying on CGI and this adds to the homage to old movie making.

The superb music score by French composer Alexandre Desplat reminded me of the richness of the past great screen composers Max Steiner and Erich Korngold .

The amazing gothic sets by Shane Vieau who designed Dune 2 and The Shape of Water and costumes by Kate Hawley who also designed Guillermo Del Toro's Crimson Peak add to what I consider perfection in a movie .

Guillermo del Toro's only choice to play Dr Victor Frankenstein was Oscar Isaac and he brings an almost sympathetic quality to what is often portrayed as a crazed villainous character.

The great supporting cast includes Christoph Waltz, Charles Dance and an actress I've never seen appropriately named Mia Goth who is splendid as Elizabeth who in Mary Shelley's novel is the fiancé of Victor Frankenstein but in this version is the fiancé of his younger brother William played by Felix Kammerer.

I loved this adaptation of Frankenstein please see it on a cinema screen don't wait till it streams in Netflix.

I predict many Oscar nominations next year for this superb movie and I hope Jacob Elordi is nominated as best actor.",figurative
"So much more than the sum of its parts I'd put off watching The Morning Show because I thought it would be a Sorkin-lite style Newsroom series set in a breakfast show and that felt like a tired format with nothing new to say. How utterly wrong I was. Yes it's got the big names. Yes it has clearly had a vast amount of money thrown at it, but that doesn't mean it isn't one of the most gripping tv series I've watched in years. The series builds and builds, the tension cranking up with each episode, literally at points, leaving me breathless. What I found particularly remarkable is that the #metoo movement is seen through so many different perspectives but cleverly the writers allow each perspective to live its own truth, whether or not that is a reliable truth or not, morally right or not, and in doing so it weaves this uncomfortable narrative that exactly reflects the rich and strange tapestry that is the real world. I thought that aspect of it was audacious. To not bring judgement and spoon feed an audience is a brave and risky thing to do. The performances are stellar, it's an ensemble cast with everyone bringing their A game. I devoured this first series in a couple of days and cannot wait for series 2. Can they replicate the clever and nuanced storytelling of this first series, I hope so.",literal
"One of my favourite shows of all time! I love series like this, and Criminal Minds is just so interesting and absorbing. It is very dark and somewhat grim often, but I like that side, it does make the show compelling. I will admit it was a show that started off good, but then got better and better. I love how it is filmed as well, the camera work is innovative, and the locations are always lovely and evocative to watch. The music is very fitting, the main theme is chilling to an extent and the music choices in each episode are appropriate and effective a vast majority of the time. The writing is always intelligent, witty and thought-provoking and the episode ideas are brilliant with moments that are chilling and moving. And of course the characters are wonderful, especially stone-faced Jason Gideon, Spencer and Hotch(as well as Rossi and Prentiss), and they are brought to life brilliantly by a sterling cast, both lead and supporting. Overall, I just love this show, it is true that some episodes are better than others(then again it is like that with most shows), whenever it is on I always watch it. 10/10 Bethany Cox",literal
"Masterpiece Oh man. This show is absolutely amazing. I didn't originally want to watch it, and the only reason I did is because my friend kept telling me and telling me to and I don't regret it at all. I'm watching better call Saul and I've seen El Camino but this show started it all. While season 1 is a bit lacklustre, the rest of the show is a masterpiece, and it never disappointed. I once heard that the first episode tries everything to get you on Walt's side, and the rest of the show sees how long you're willing to stay with him, and I fully agree with that sentiment. At the beginning, you agree with Walt and think that he's reasonable in his actions, I mean he had to kill krazy-8 or he would kill Walt's family. But throughout the show, even if you don't notice, you don't continue to agree with him, but you still like him. I believe this is because of that first episode. Everytime Walter White does something bad you think back to the first episode and think ""Look how far he's come."" But Eventually, He isn't Walter White anymore, but fully Heisenberg. This is when you truly see him as a villain. The Question is, Did the Cancer change Walt into becoming this monster, or Did it just reveal who he always wanted, nay, who he was all along?",figurative
Disturbing but good This is definitely the best portrayal of Jeffery Dahmer I've seen. Evan Peter's was great in this. Eat your heart out Jeremey Renner. No pun intended. It's about time someone made a mini-series about Dahmer's life. Mostly because this psychopaths story is way too intricate to squeeze into a two hour film. The 2002 Jeremy Renner film was terrible and the 2017 film My Friend Dahmer didn't do the story much justice. This show gets into much more detail. I had no idea his mother was on tons of psychological medication while she was pregnant. Or that she was a suicidal UFO nut. I never knew he spent time in Germany as a US Army combat medic. A lot of the events that took place were news to me. I'm glad I decided to check this show out. It's definitely worth a watch. 8 stars.,literal
"Only because I can't rate it ZERO stars... There is absolutely ZERO plot through this movie. Nothing makes sense. Someone asked if ChatGPT wrote this script, and that was a perfect description for this. This movie was beyond boring. I only stayed because we bought tickets and ordered food at the movie theater. I truly can't believe these actors signed on for this... There really is nothing more that can be said positive about this movie.

Impressive high kicks from Wendi McLendon-Covey, there's someone who takes their personal fitness seriously! But, David Grier's character steals the show (such as it is) he's got the best lines and doesn't waste them.

"I was there during this time period I really loved the 2 seasons of this show. Suspenseful, griping storyline and great acting.

I lived on the Navajo Reservation in Shiprock during this time period when I was 8 years old. The look and feel really brought a lot back. The beauty of the desert is hard to capture just how stunningly gorgeous it is, but the film crew does a very good job.

My dad was an OBGYN and we lived there in 1972.

We went to Jim Charley's church and his son Wilton drew an amazing picture for us that I have hanging up today! (He was loved by the people and of course did not sterilize the women) I have lot of Native American art from this time period which I love and treasure.

Apart from that I will say this is a fabulous show and I highly recommend it!",figurative
"A Must Watch for Fans of House MD (and Beyond!) I can't believe I only heard about Doc through a random TikTok! As a longtime House MD fan, I clicked out of curiosity but within minutes, I was hooked. I ended up watching all 15 available episodes in less than 24 hours. This show has the formula down sharp writing, emotional depth, medical realism, and characters that feel genuinely human. Dr. Amy Larsen's story hits hard: the mix of memory loss, identity, and redemption is beautifully balanced with intense hospital cases and heartfelt moments. Molly Parker completely commands every scene, and the supporting cast adds layers that make the story believable and addicting. It's rare to find a medical drama that feels both intelligent and emotionally grounded, but Doc nails it.

If you loved House, The Good Doctor, or New Amsterdam, you'll find Doc even more compelling. I just hope they keep the momentum going - because I'm absolutely ready for the next episode!",literal
Boring I love Missy Peregrym from Rookie Blue & was excited to see her back in a police drama. But this is nothing like Rookie Blue. There was not a boring moment in RB if it was similar then i'd Be happy. This show is too slow and hard to keep interest.,literal
"How Atrocities Happen After reading some of these reviews, it's a mistake to compare this film with Kubrick's excellent film because this film isn't focused on the Nuremberg trials as courtroom drama. The main focus is on Göring & the ""relationship"" he develops with Dr. Kelley, & how Kelley comes to realize the depths of evil Göring's capable of committing behind his often charming, intelligent, narcissistic--and sometimes disarming--facade, & that this evil isn't a trait of a ""Nazi mind."" A secondary focus relates to the difficult task of establishing trials when no precedent existed for such trials; the allies weren't even sure what crimes to charge the Nazi leaders with, but it was absolutely necessary that once charged & tried, the Nazi leaders had to be convicted because the world was watching. That sounds simple. Who could imagine them not being convicted? But it wasn't as simple as it seems decades later; Göring made escaping justice not outside the realm of possibility.

Crowe is simply amazing as Göring: alternately haughty, defiant, warm, funny, & even vulnerable--but always there's an underlying menacing aspect to him. He has great affection for his family, for his country, for his leader, but he can casually sign off on the death of millions of people & feel no remorse nor regret. And he is always in control of himself.

Malik is also good, but sometimes his reactions are, imo, exaggerated. He gets reeled in by Göring, & it's not until he physically sees the results of Göring's actions that he truly sees the real Göring.

The entire supporting cast was top notch, most notably Michael Shannon as Justice Jackson, a man of principle, who was the driving force behind the tribunal, & Leo Woodall as Sgt. Triest. (There's been some criticism of John Slatterly, but he captures Colonel Andrus.) It's easy to see how Göring, & those like him, manipulated & captured an entire nation's people given the devastation to Germany after WW I. It's also easy to see that this type of manipulation didn't end with the Third Reich.",literal

Not better or worse than the UK Version I loved the UK version so when I heard they were bringing it to the US I was sure they were going to screw it up. I was sorely mistaken it's so good. It starts off a bit rough but really comes into its own. The Halloween episodes are the best. Jay ( the male lead) has way more character development than the original . I love how the writers are finding creative ways to involve jay with the ghosts. That's always been one of my gripes with the UK show. I love how the ghosts now have more to do. This version is more zany and heartwarming. If you like zany humor you'd probably like this. If you like dry humor you'd probably like UK version. I wouldn't say one is better than the other it's just different and it depends on your humor. Like all sitcoms it takes a bit to get good.,literal
"This show should never end!!! I am not a Breaking Bad fanboy, although I must admit that I binged through it, when I was watching it, and liked it very much. The thing I liked the most was the Quentin Tarantino-esque element of it : Unpredictable situations leading to outrageous outcomes.

If you too liked that about Breaking Bad, there is no better show for you than Better Call Saul.

Right from the opening scene, and especially for people who are aware that this show is about a key chracter from Breaking Bad, this starts at such a faraway place in terms of story that you just do not know what to make of it!

And that is exactly what is fascinating about this show. The story and character development. This show is not a spin-off. It's a parallel prequel, and a brilliant one at that. Slow- burning, outrageous, funny, smart. And it gets you a HUGE shot of Breaking Bad Nostalgia because of the key characters that it brings back. I will name only the biggest one : Gus Fring!!! (Yaaaayyy!) Rest is for you to figure out as you watch and get delighted!

I, however, watch it for Rhea Seehorn. Oh what a delight she is. Just brilliant. The dressing down she gives to Lalo Salamanca for tormenting Saul in the penultimate episode of Season 5 is stunning. Go watch it!

"Black Phone 2 proves that the sequel curse is breakable Black Phone 2 nails what so many horror sequels fail at: honoring the original with clever callbacks while carving out a fresh, eerie story of its own. The jump scares are sharp, inventive, and land perfectly-no lazy repeats here.

The film weaves together nods to classic horror-from Freddy Krueger and Nightmare on Elm Street vibes to echoes of M. Night Shyamalan's Glass universe of clairvoyants-creating an atmosphere that feels both nostalgic and chillingly new.

At its core, Black Phone 2 is Gwen and Finny's story-two kids caught in a relentless fight against pure evil. Their bond, courage, and raw defiance give the movie its beating heart, turning the terror into something strangely hopeful. It's a horror sequel that doesn't just scare you-it makes you care.",literal
"Entertaining but Jonas Bros should stick to singing I think I would've rather liked a concert to watch rather than this movie; but it was not that bad.

The singing was bad as it's pretty obvious that while singing - they were not singing and a guitar that suddenly shows up while they're in the middle of the woods was pretty stupid.

These men are very cute and have had a great career and they had a lot of great actors in the movie, but again it really was not well done with storyline that was far-fetched and then messing with their singing into the movie where they should've been singing not a higher pitched pipped in sound.

Even as they were acting as themselves, they're pretty poor actors and she should stick the music videos and not some hour long movie.",literal
"A Brutal Vacation Timo Tjahjanto's Nobody 2 is a relentless, bone-crunching sequel that doubles down on the first film's blend of suburban angst and bloody mayhem. This time, Bob Odenkirk's Hutch Mansell is on vacation, which of course becomes a backdrop for an insane series of creatively staged, over-the-top fight sequences. Tjahjanto, known for his work on action films like The Night Comes for Us, brings a distinct, stylized flair to the violence, turning the tranquil setting of a small town and an amusement park into a series of deadly playgrounds. The plot is thin and largely exists to string together these incredible set pieces, but that's not a criticism-the movie knows exactly what it is. It's a joyful, unpretentious action romp. The action is more outlandish and even more graphic than the original, with a dark, cartoonish sense of humor that differentiates it from the more grounded, noirish tone of the first film.

Some critics have noted that the sequel loses some of the original's gritty charm in favor of a more comedic, outlandish style, but praise the film for being an entertaining and satisfying follow-up.

Is it worth watching? If you're a fan of the first film and are looking for a fun, fast-paced action movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, then absolutely.",literal
"An average Netflix Christmas movie Look, this is your typical streaming Christmas movie. Is it anything special? Naw. But does it work as a Christmas movie? Totally.

The story follows a separated couple trying to celebrate Christmas together before finalizing their divorce. You've got the new girlfriend, the hot guy who conveniently takes his shirt off, and a Harry Potter-obsessed Nigel (I actually loved that dude). It's super predictable, but honestly, that doesn't hurt it at all.

The cast works well enough, and there are a few fun familiar faces. The small-town Christmas setting is always a win, and that's exactly what we get here-cozy, simple, and right on theme.

"Why must sequels always be poorer? I enjoyed SISU 2, but it suffered from the same flaw as other Finnish sequels: It lost its originality and did not expand upon the strenghts of its original (yeah, that seems obvious).

The film offers quite a few amusing moments of action that defy all laws of physics, but it made the mistake of making the protagonist emotional, while at the same time removing anyone from the story that he could save with his exploits (except himself and a bunch of wooden beams. That is just poor writing with an eye to the formula of the original.

"This rating is caused by the huge disappointment after the last season I was a big fan of Game of Thrones ever since it first aired on HBO. However, after waiting for two years, I (as probably also a lot of others) felt that the season didn't rise up the rest of the show. I believe the writers and producers didn't do the show justice and rushed the story. In these 6 episodes and pretty much destroyed most of the major character lines. It took 7 seasons for these complex story lines to evolve, just to be shattered in 2 episodes. That being said, taking in consideration that season 8 is a part of GOT, I don't believe anymore that the show deserves the 9.5 stars.",literal
"Depends on your mood. 'Playdate' is the kind of movie you're either going to really enjoy, or really hate. It sort of falls in the vein of 'Nobody' and 'Novocaine', but without the emotional punch. This is action for the sake of action and comedy for the sake of comedy, and there isn't really an in-between. The humour also mostly edges towards slapstick.

Regardless, I still had a good time with 'Playdate'. I guess the moment makes the big difference. If you're in the mood for this kind of movie, then you will be satisfied. If you're in the mood for an action comedy with a bit more substance and emotional depth to it, then you will be disappointed. Since I was in the mood for light entertainment with enough action to keep me interested, I was satisfied.

Ok, so Kevin James stars as Brian, who has just lost his job. His wife Emily (Sarah Chalke) suggests he stays at home with her son (his stepson) Lucas while she works extra shifts. (I must also add, there was absolutely no chemistry between Kevin and Emily and they did not come across as a married couple.)

While trying to bond with Lucas, they meet Jeff and his son CJ playing ball. Jeff and CJ instantly connects with Brian and Lucas and invites them to their home, which starts a very unconventional friendship. Things quickly spiral out of control when CJ tells Brian that Jeff isn't his Dad, and that he was taken. And soon they find themselves on the run and being shot it, and it becomes clear Jeff and CJ are not who they appear to be.

Some moments definitely were more silly than funny, but in general it was mostly entertaining, and there's plenty of action and excitement. Its not exactly the kind of movie I'd watch again and again, but it was cool for a once off. I really enjoyed hunky Alan Ritchson as Jeff, who - despite being a hugely built action junkie - liked to cuddle and hold hands. He was so sweet, actually! In fact, I think he made the movie more enjoyable.",literal
"Crazy like a fox-... i mean wolf Oh man, there's a lot going on here. A detective story about a monster rampaging the French countryside, a mash of competing genres (romance, horror, martial arts, political) . . . And Monica Bellucci thrown in for good measure. Makes you wonder how they sold this project to investors (how much cocaine it took to grease those wheels?). And yet, it all comes together somehow. Despite his lack of dialogue , Mark Dacascos was the enigmatic allure for me, and I'll admit I was disappointed when his part of the story came to an end. The fight scenes are engaging, the locations really help this setting come to life, and the story is just crazy enough to work. Bottom line, it's a trip, and well worth the time.",literal
"Pretty solid horror but lacking a story Shelby Oaks is a pretty solid horror movie,the film kind which carries that horror flick tension that you expect and stretches throughout the movie intensity,brilliantly conveyed by the cast, whose performances anchor the mounting terror. Definitely has its positives during the first half of the movie with its dark plot and unpredictable twists but as it gets to the half way point it then lacks its consistency and it's pace of it's storytelling.

The cinematography was great, even better soundtrack,the spooky atmosphere was pretty good aswell and the visuals were enjoyable to watch and felt it was well directed.

But I think the storyline was its weak point and abit of a let down There's some strange moments where the characters and the movie scenes didnt play out logically but minus the negatives it was a pretty decent watch.",literal
"ER on steroids As many others have noted, The Pitt is very realistic in terms of the emergency medicine. Additionally, without the limits of network television, it has fewer guardrails. However, throwing F-bombs, pissing and pooping on people, and occasionally showing genitalia does not, by itself, make The Pitt better. What ER did have was engaging storytelling and characters with lives outside the ER, which so far The Pitt does not even try to do. I have yet to see anything in Pittsburgh other than stock shots of the city. Moreover, for a show set in Pittsburgh, it would be nice to at least have some of the minor characters speak with a Pittsburgh accent (i.e., yinzers). True, the doctors would likely come from elsewhere, but the patients and nurses should speak with the local accent, and not sound like they're all from Southern California.",literal
"Horrible Messages About Modern-Day Dating Let me preface by saying that my wife was a matchmaker for over 2 years in L. A. She lived the life of walking around asking people ""hey are you single?"" So naturally, she and I were excited to see this movie. While there were a few nods to the common (and hilariously ridiculous) issues that matchmakers deal with and some all-too-relatable moments for my wife, we were ultimately very disappointed.

1) I'll avoid spoilers, but essentially the messages sent by this movie to all the single people out there are depressing and incredibly shallow.

2) For a movie called ""Materialists"" that makes references to money consistently throughout, there was a shocking lack of eye candy in the film. Dinner scenes showed no food. Fancy homes were decorated by a beige monster. Not even travel porn.

3) I'm a fan of Dakota in general, but wow this is a stale performance. She's monotone and lacks any chemistry with the main characters. They interact as if she has a restraining order against them in real life but already signed up to do the movie together.

4) Everything. Is. So. Slow. The character's speak at a snail's pace. They also don't have conversations. Instead, they take turns reciting long monologues to each other. Scenes are drawn out in order to create drama and the soundtrack must just be a Pandora station called ""Melodramatic Elevator Music."" For a movie that centers around human connection, the main characters interacted like they were written by AI.

The marketing/pr for the film made it seem like this was going to be light, airy, and more of a rom-com. Sadly, that was not the case.

Verdict: Don't Watch.",literal
"I Just Didn't Care...and Knew I Wouldn't (Flash Review)

Watching this more out of curiosity and for something easy, this is a movie makes pyrotechnics lots of money. Vin Diesel, who is a terrible actor, blows a lot of stuff up after being forcefully recruited by the government and thrust into a special mission without any training; just on his instincts, large muscles and tough guy charisma. The plot (who cares?) is a forgettable sushi wrap thin excuse for the mindless action. He needs to stop some stereotypical Russian crime mob; nuff said. However, it actually had some decent non-CGI action moments. And it was about time someone has been shot by a sniper at a raging concert, fell backwards onto the crowd and crowd surfed....dead.....finally! (Sarcasm)",figurative
"Do Not Resusitate Don't get me wrong, the premise for Nurse Jackie is great. Edie Falco plays Jackie Peyton, a Vicodin addicted nurse whose whole world (and this series, it turns out) are held together by the hope that nobody will discover her dirty little secret. During the day, she's the Champion ER Nurse of All Time, showing both compassion and brains while bucking the system that promotes and protects profit-hungry hospitals and rock star egomaniac doctors at the expense of the everyday working man and woman. Bravo Jackie.

Not so much so to the show's creator's Liz Brixius and Linda Wallum, who, it seems, had every good intention when they dreamed up this little show, which has, since season one, devolved into a horribly solipsistic mishmash of retreads from all the most forgettable network TV hospital dramas and bad nighttime soaps.

See, NJ has one card to play --- the one stated above --- and after that ace is revealed, the rest of the show goes on life support. Season two ended promisingly enough (after 85% of it was recycled St. Elsewhere hubris) with some much needed suspense revolving around that ace.

I've only watched a few episodes of season three but it is mind numbingly horrific.

One of the big problems is the roster of bland, two-dimensional supporting characters (not the actors, with the exception of teeth-grindingly cutesy Merritt Wever). They run the gamut from Thor (not fleshed out enough...really just a gay cardboard cut-out) to Ackolidas (Anna Devere Smith utterly wasted in the 'bad boss with a heart of gold shtick' --- did I actually see her talking to a monkey in one episode or did I dream that?) to unbelievably dense (Falco's husband on the series....just a weak-willed cypher who's decades too young to play opposite Falco, at least in appearance).

The first season had some interesting subplots, including the one about the OCD daughter. The newer episodes have as subplots: 1) Will Wever get together with her hunky slob of an EMT boyfriend? 2) Will Peter Facinelli (another great actor in a wastoid role) make up with the male nurse who punched him after he screwed his girlfriend? Add in the Xanax-induced doze of all the hacky ""zany"" ER episode-length plots that try so earnestly to win our hearts and funny bones. They get neither.

It's too bad Showtime didn't see the broken railroad tracks at the end of this speeding freight train when they green-lighted it. I'm sure they thought Falco alone could save it. Sorry....pull the plug and DNR it if you value your time and sanity.",literal
"Dated, But still entertains This Arnie veichle made in his 80's heyday is one of his better ones, It's a movie based on a Stephen King book of the same name.

"Slow-Burn Storytelling Black Rabbit is a masterclass in slow lingering suspense, a series that rewards patient viewers with a deeply satisfying and thought provoking experience. While some might be initially taken aback by its deliberate pacing and dialogue-heavy scenes, these elements are not a weakness but the very foundation of its strength. The show understands that true tension isn't always found in frantic action, but in the quiet, charged spaces between people, in the unspoken histories and simmering resentments.",literal
"Couldn't get into it. I saw all the good reviews for this and decided to give it a go. I'm so disappointed cause I really expected this to be good. It was just ok. Felt kind of forced and a bit too silly for me.

I enjoyed Martin Short's character but I didn't think Steve Martin was that funny in this which was a shame. Kind of felt like a male version of Grace & Frankie... with Selena thrown in to widen the viewer age range.

I like Selena but for whatever reason she put on this dull, monotone voice throughout the whole thing which began to really grate on me a couple of episodes in.

I'm hearing impaired and the deaf episode just felt too much. All the hollow, muffled sound in that episode was just really annoying for me and left me turning my hearing aids down. I understand that they are trying to be inclusive but just felt weird.

Not the worst thing you'll ever see but definitely not an 8/10.",literal
"Good review Absolutely riveting! It's astonishingly original epic show in. It's refreshing to watch something so new, well rounded and rought with suspense and drama at every turn.

A dystopian futuristic drama in the vein of Blade Runner, Dune, and other sci-fi magnum opuses, RBW draws you in from the first episode with this forboding feeling that something unexpected is going to happen. The vivid and awe inspiring world building rendered in large part by an FX department that spares no expense.

The series lead seems to be the mysterious and at times seeringly haunting Mother, played to perfection by relative newcomer Amanda Collins. It certainly is the most complex and exciting role so far. Vikings fans will sport wood once they gaze upon the space mulleted Travis Fimmel swaggering into the frame in the first episode. This is Fimmel in fine form with a substantial role not too dissimilar from the iconic Ragnar Lothbrok. He's tough, layered, and it feels damn good to have him back on the small screen.",literal
"6 is a realistic score People have either gotten very generous with extending 10 ratings or they are simple minded and easily entertained. This show is a 6 at best. The writing is predictable and the acting is pretty terrible. When you can guess what's going to happen next, that's not excellent TV. Taylor Sheridan shows no diversity in the characteristics of his male leads. Literally always the same trait. Old tough guys who get the hot women and can beat up anyone regardless of their age, skill or weapon. It's a male boomer fairy tale. Billy Bob in Landman. Kevin Kostner in Yellowstone. Jeremy Reiner in Mayor of Kingstown. Stallone in Tulsa King...all the exact same character. Drab and repetitive writing. Lazy.",literal
"Oscar worthy Performance. Take away all the historical liberties and the shortened trial you get left with a film full of strong characters, emotional silences and one of the greatest performances from Russell Crowe you will ever see.

Not only is his German flawless, but he holds ever scene with dominance and arrogance that Goering showed during the real trials.

He deserves to win as many accolades there is and to think he filmed this and four other roles back to back is an amazing achievement.",literal

"disappointment I went into James Gunn's Superman with high hopes, but I walked out feeling deeply disappointed. This didn't feel like the Superman I grew up with - it felt like a joke.

From the start, the movie tries too hard to be funny, throwing in quips and gags at moments that should have been serious. The bright, cartoonish visuals and fast pace made it feel more like a Marvel comedy than a DC epic. I wanted a Superman with heart, depth, and moral weight; instead, I got something that often felt like a parody.

David Corenswet is a fine actor, and I think he could be a great Superman in a different kind of script. But here, his character is overshadowed by forced humor and by Krypto, the CGI super-dog, who kept pulling me out of the story. The stakes never felt real, and the emotional moments just didn't land.

As a lifelong Superman fan, this movie left me frustrated. It was colorful, yes, but it lacked the soul and seriousness I believe Superman deserves.

Verdict: A missed opportunity - fun for some, but not the Superman movie I was hoping for.",literal
"The best characters in San Francisco I believe many pieces of fiction naturally have a goal to make you think something along the lines of ""It was an honor to share in the lives of these fictional characters"". This show hits that goal undeniably well. Even those coming for the mystery, which granted it focus less on, should be captivated by the humanity that is carried out not only in the writing but in the performance of all cast members. Props to all departments involved.

Although Netflix has been tough on series renewals lately, I hope they fulfill this shows potention in granting them a season 2 as I hope to see more of these incredible characters' journeys.",literal
"The Emperor Has No Clothes Where do I begin? I would be forced to nominate ""The Sopranos"" as the worst television show of all-time, the worst THING of all-time. It is pretentious, derivative schlock masquerading- and passing- as high art.

Martin Scorsese's ""GoodFellas"" is probably my favorite film of all-time, and it tells the TRUE story of a REAL gangster in his OWN words with wonderfully vivid characters, rich dialogue, scenes of shocking violence and outrageous humor with brilliant visuals and mood so strong you'll feel nostalgia for people you never knew. David Chase clearly loved this movie so much he decided to re-make it as a TV series. And take credit for it. And fail.

The twist? Tony Soprano, our gangster protagonist, sees a psychiatrist because he feels bad about being a gangster protagonist. When he's not desperately endearing himself to the audience by confessing his secret love for animals in thrice-weekly sessions he's living the good gangsta life: smoking fat stogies (always a sign of success) and cruisin' round Jersey in his gas-guzzling Cadillac Hog.

But wait? Is there ANY reality to be found here? Would any mafioso ever voluntarily visit a psychiatrist and confess his guilt over his crimes? Does this not kill the vicarious gangster-fantasy ostensibly promised by the premise? Who are we rooting for? Tony Soprano to be ""cured"" of his criminal lifestyle or Tony Soprano to earn dirty money and outrun the law? The shrink to successfully rehabilitate him? The FBI to bring him down? David Chase never figured it out... and you won't either. Movies have run-times and lead to specific endings; a TV series runs indefinitely and cannot maintain a morally, ethically, legally conflicted hero. Billy Crystal said it best as the shrink in ""Analyze This,"" a film with the same premise but played for COMEDY, when he said, ""So my goal is to make you a happy, well-adjusted gangster?""

Fatally-flawed blueprint aside, the show MIGHT have been successful if characters faced authentic criminal scenarios and their consequences. Instead Chase & his writers take carte blanche in concocting kooky capers, money-making schemes, and meaningless violence that would make anyone who reads the paper burst out laughing. The gangsters own a strip-club so the viewers get to see some background ass, but they also own an Arthur Ave-style deli so we can see them eating wedges at sidewalk tables- convenient, no? Chase & Co. never figured out what it is that gangsters DO, and you can see them scramble each week to invent a new routine. They also tried to buy legitimacy by poaching EVERY actor who appeared in Goodfellas- over 20 of them appeared in The Sopranos. What does it tell you that DeNiro, Liotta & Pesci were also asked to appear?

What does it tell you that DeNiro, Liotta & Pesci all turned him down?

The show's story-arcs were so poorly-planned that characters would appear and do nothing for an entire season before the requisite whacking... (Buscemi anyone?) The killings became the worst crutch in dramatic history: characters and story lines were only and inevitably resolved by over-the-top murders, which dissolved almost immediately into self-parody.(Quentin wants his act back.) The only consistency in the show was story lines starting strong and fizzling almost instantly. The stop-and-start production of the series is painfully obvious- there is a disjointed, slapdash feel to characters and episodes that were rushed and neglected. Worse, every labored plot line in the show begs to be associated with the Shakespearian tragedy of ""The Godfather"" films or the black-comic seduction of ""Goodfellas."" By reaching for both, ""The Sopranos"" achieves neither.

I wish I could find a single element that worked: even the portrayal of the East Coast Italian family is botched. They walk and talk like industry Angelenos- even flirting with a film-production storyline- until a plot twist demands they return to Roman-Catholic guilt and neighborhood respect. Who are these people? 

Now a word on Gandolfini: he's not Brando. Or DeNiro. Or Pacino. He's not Liotta, Pesci or Duvall. He's not even James Caan. He is a good actor, swept up in the hype of the most over-rated show in history. And a word on the press: the HBO hype machine was working overtime for 7 years to insist this series was one of the all-time greats... they bought themselves awards, they silenced those who dared question its quality, and they used an ironically Mafia-like approach to intimidate viewers into submission. A word on the 90's: you either loved ""The Sopranos,"" or you never spoke about it. It was socially unacceptable to declare that the Emperor wore no clothes.

Listen up, goombahs... the man is nude. Buck. Naked. The Sopranos blows. It offends me as an Italian, an American, and a film fan. Cranking up the Stones and hiring every actor from Goodfellas does not make you Scorsese, Mr. Chase. Fat men sipping cappuccino does not equate you with Coppola. Skunk-headed clowns and greasy wax museum escapees do not legitimize a series that shamelessly steals from some of the best movies ever made. David Chase is a fraud and The Sopranos is a joke. The one nice thing I can say about the show is that it had a wonderful theme song and title sequence.

Everything afterward was trash.

Tremendous performances all round, great script, excellent cinematography and pacing , it's a movie that will also reveal a lot more of itself with repeat views.

"Better Call Sau vs Breaking Bad ! After Breaking Bad, I had come to a vague conclusion that no show ever could match its brilliance. So, even though I was very much aware of the fact that Better Call Saul is a well-made spinoff of Breaking Bad which is regarded by many as the best show ever made on earth, I was not to indulge any more in that world of good vs bad, family vs cartel, right choices vs wrong choices. It was my dear old friend who almost forced me to start giving myself a chance. And upon his persistent persuasions, I finally gave in and began my tryst with Better Call Saul, lovingly referred as BCS by us. And the first lesson I learnt within just a few episodes, never come to any conclusion purely on the basis of perception without having the first-hand experience of something. Better Call Saul is an experience of a lifetime, to be savoured and to be shared.

Breaking Bad with its cult storyline has many similarities with its successor (or predecessor?). In BB, it was the transformation of a simpleton school teacher to a drug monster. It was the transformation of family loving Walter to money loving Heisenberg. In BCS, its about the transformation of the happy-go-lucky Jimmy McGill to the notorious conman Saul Goodman. But Breaking Bad didn't try to be non-linear for a single moment. Maybe that was the moot point why it had gained such universal approval. BCS takes the tougher path and shines gloriously. It is like a time travel. It is about stories within stories. BB was happy to portray human angst and desperation in time of crisis. It was about how greed turns a man to a monster. But it stayed within the boundary of a thriller. Better Call Saul is more about exploring the intricacies of human relations, changing dynamics of inter-personal complexities, decaying values. It's perplexing, non-linear and sheer experimentation with human emotions where a scene of smear of blood oozing out from a skull is succeeded by Goodman chomping on a piece of meat dipped in red sauce. Marvelous!

Breaking Bad was about hellraisers. BCS is about that hell. Breaking Bad had wider scopes to explore every single character as the narrative was straightforward and the number of key characters was less. BCS had the tougher task as it had to show the background of some of the already known characters and it introduced so many new characters. Just think about the character of Nacho Varga. Even though you don't really appreciate his ways or choices, you cannot stop loving or rooting for him in some nail-biting scenes. Chuck is another character built with so much care, so much passion, so much craft and so many complex layers. Same about Howard Hamlin. You tend to forget what is right and what is wrong which I think an aspect of BCS conspicuously absent in the mother show. Comedy in BB was limited to the chemistry of Walter and Jesse. BCS takes comedy seriously! And transformation from a comic scene to gory murder is frequent and flawless. Camera works in both the shows are top-notch but BCS is a bit ahead maybe because of the advanced technology in the time gap between the two shows. Another aspect where BCS overpowers its illustrious predecessor is music. From the Bengali song Henna Henna to the mellifluous adaptation of Nancy Sinatra's Sugar Town, from the classical Laundry Workers to the foot tapping romantic Something Stupid, music of BCS is a revelation. Did I forget to mention that Rhea Seehorn made the show much more exciting than Breaking Bad where the protagonist ladies often played spoilsports.

Both the shows in my opinion are unparallel, incomparable and unique in their own style and right. Nothing can ever take the credit from Breaking Bad for what it has done to the TV industry. But Better Call Saul deserves standing ovation in its own right. Personally, I found BCS more enchanting. But that's absolutely a personal choice. Let's celebrate the victory of Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould who have given us such back-to-back masterpieces. Life of a film buff like me would have remained incomplete without these two.",figurative
"Del Toro's Melancholically Radiant Vision for Shelley's Classic Experienced Del Toro's latest on the big screen in 35mm print and was left speechless. The film is far from being compact in length but managed to present some of the best cinema of 2025, an expertly crafted culmination of multiple decades of experience from Del Toro.

Visually, the film is nothing short of a masterpiece. The set design, costumes, and cinematography are stunning, and every frame is a joy to look at. The visual effects (admirably, mostly practical effects) are spot on, and Desplat's score, albeit a little bit overly dramatic at times, is hauntingly beautiful and elevates the experience to a whole other level.

I will admit this is the first film adaptation of Mary Shelley's classic tale that I watched, but I am familiar with some of the artistic liberties Del Toro took in his adaptation, and I think the vast majority of them are beautiful and help breathe life into the tale at modern times, while also helping differentiate it from other adaptations and giving Del Toro's unique spin to it. Similarly to his work on Pinocchio (2022), you can see his admiration and respect for the source material while you can also see his personal footprint and soul poured all over the project.

Oscar Isaac is brilliant in his role as Dr. Frankenstein, and Jacob Elordi shines in a career-pivoting role. Goth and Waltz are great as well, and the film features some other pleasantly familiar faces, like Game of Thrones alums Charles Dance and David Bradley. An all-around great performance from the amazing cast completes the craft of the film as another career highlight in Del Toro's magical filmography.

I will say the movie is a little bit too long while ironically the plot also takes some shortcuts and contrivances to push things forward; but that's not as dire as it sounds, and the film is enjoyable from start to finish, with great writing and directing from Del Toro.

A poetic tale that mourns and dazzles, Del Toro's adaptation of ""Frankenstein"" is one of the most beautiful and well-crafted films of the year. While preserving the heart of the original tale and taking brave liberties to unify it as Guillermo's personal work, Frankenstein works on every level and manages to serve as 150 minutes of pure cinema and breathtaking entertainment.",figurative

"Best Film of 2025 - Nuremberg This version of (Judgement at) Nuremberg is, in my opinion, superior to the original. Rami Malek matches Academy Award winner, Maximillan Schell scene for scene, and thensome. There are actually very few scenes that this version has in common with the original.

Director James Vanderbilt, along with writer Jack El-Hai, both did an outstanding job of re-creating the courtroom atmosphere of the world-famous trial of the century in 1946. I found the segment of Hermann Hess fascinating, and thought it should have been examined more closely, but then the film would have been an unwieldy three hours.

There are several top-notch performances in this film. Outside of Malek's Oscar-winning performance, there is Russell Crowe's Oscar-winning performance. Leo Woodall and John Slattery (Madmen) also give great performances.

So, aside from Best Film, Best Editing, Best Screenplay, Best Actor, and Best Supporting Actor, this film should win at least 5 Academy Awards (probably more), or I don't anything about reviewing films. I will go out on a limb on this one. Do not miss this one; it is EASILY the best film of 2025.",literal
"Great Cast and Great Plot I'll start by saying that if you have watched the UK version of this (Which by the way was made by Channel 4 and Company Pictures and NOT the BBC as these other reviews suggest) You probably won't enjoy this first episode. Its a straight transition of the script with some adjustments.

However having seen shows that were changed beyond all recognition I can say that is a good thing.

The cast are excellent in their roles and the story which is far from the usual tame fodder of American drama is handled with honesty and realism. The characters mostly have their own interests to consider as well as the kids trying to keep their family together. 

William H Macy is ideal in a role which doesn't allow him much initial screen time but I'm sure future episodes will focus on him since Frank is such a fascinating character. Can't wait for episode 2.",literal
"Douglas Sirk is the Man When churlish, spoiled rich man Bob Merrick foolishly wrecks his speed boat, the rescue team resuscitates him with equipment that is therefore unavailable to aid a local hero, Dr. Wayne Phillips, who dies as a result. Phillips had helped many people, and when Merrick learns Phillips' secret, to give selflessly and in secret, he tries it in a ham-handed way.

""Magnificent Obsession"" was an early starring role for Hudson, and, according to Wyman, he was very nervous. Some of his scenes had to be re-shot thirty or forty times, but Wyman never said a word. Reportedly, years later at a party, Hudson ran into Wyman and said, ""You were nice to me when you didn't have to be, and I want you to know that I thank you and love you for it."" Douglas Sirk mastered the melodrama, and had the greatest color palettes. He also really knew how to utilize Rock Hudson. I don't know much about his personal life, but it strikes me as interesting that Sirk is now championed in some gay circles. Did Sirk know his star, Hudson, was gay? He certainly could have... though this would have been unusual in the 1950s.",literal
"Stick around If you look at the entertainment we have today, you'll have noticed the way reality TV is going nowadays - shows featuring people willing to put themselves through anything for five minutes of fame, and producers all too willing to let them humiliate themselves on TV. It's not too far a leap to imagine that some vile TV exec out there has been trying to get the right to show people be executed live on TV. We've already had that, however, with the ghoulish al-Qaida hostage beheading videos posted on the internet. It seems that in the current climate, at least some people are perfectly fine with watching real death on their television sets.

With that in mind, and coupled with the fact that everything these days appears to be a revival of the 80s, you have to be impressed by the far-sightedness of this film. Of course, we haven't reached there yet, as it's terrorists, rather than the mainstream media, who have bought us easily available programs featuring real human death, but you just have to wonder how long it is before some exec decides to see if he can find a way of pitching a show that combines people's desire for entertainment and desire to indulge their morbid curiosity...

As a fan of Arnold, I could easily say that this is his most realistic and relevant movie. It almost perfectly predicts what happens in our current world from hunger to societal unrest to technology's dominance over people. With a stunning performance from our main hero as well as spectacular action scenes, this movie earns a yes from me.

The story was far ahead of its time, and its well depicted in this movie. The first time I watched this, it was ""brains off"", and enjoy the popcorn and the movie. It's just a Schwarzenegger movie. But now, when you think about it, it's no longer far-fetched. Bur most of all, it's still entertaining, and my favourite one-liner movie.",literal

What frustrates me even more is that the other characters support her instead of correcting her when she is rude and disrespectful to her mom. I don't think anyone should talk to their mom that way, especially when the mom hasn't done anything to deserve it. Lurlay seems like an ungrateful daughter and a rebel, I find Rory annoying when she tries to speak in that angelic tone with her voice.",literal
"Great storyline A great movie , good storyline...Almost the same with Murder next door

Karl Alberg moves to a quiet coastal town to soothe a psyche that has been battered by big-city police work, but finds himself needing to call upon all his skills to solve the murders that continue to wash up on his shore.

Detective Karl Alberg comes to Gibsons at a moment of change and upheaval - in his own life and also in the small, seaside community. Now Alberg and his team - his brilliant protégé Edwina Yen, old-hand Sid Sokolowski, and roguish rookie Andy Kendrick - face an array of unexpected challenges: secrets stir just beneath the beauty of the small town's surface. Recently divorced, Alberg finds himself falling for Cassandra Lee, a striking librarian whose deep ties in the community complicate both his role as Chief of Police and a tricky relationship with his teenage daughter, who has followed him across the country.",literal
A Bit Disappointed I found that the new Predator film certain parts of it i liked but there were some parts of the film that i did'nt like and to me seemed kind of formulaic .The first part of the film i liked alot .We get a glimpse of the Yautja culture where there is no room for weakness etc. Watching this the Klingons came to mind .Great effects and the make up job on the Predator was really good very convincing. I grew a bit disappointed with certain aspects of the film about halfway through things like the cute alien that pops up and the the evil corperation which was represented by the synthetics androids .It got a bit predictable at about this point .I kind of left the film disappointed. I gave it 5 stars for the great effects and the make up.,literal
"Movie Within the Movie Spoilers herein.

We all live in our own movies. Most Hughes films deal with adolescent elements of this in simpler ways than here. In this case, we have a movie about two kids who create their own `movie.""

All the humor is movie humor: characters from another movie invade for instance.

The problem is that Hughes usually plays it both ways: he demonstrates how artificial the imaginings of the teen are and at the same time sucks us into the warm sweetness of those same imaginings. The fulcrum is usually Molly Ringwald who knew to support this enterprise, I presume intuitively. She made Hughes a success, not the other way around.

And isn't that what this is all about?

"Amusing and frivolous, but NOT a very clever story, although it really wants to be... Amusing heist movie about several heists performed by magicians.

The good: the actors are great, because they simply are: Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, these guys are always worth watching.

The not so good: this story is intended to be really clever, but anyone who has ever seen Ocean's Eleven wont be impressed by this supposedly clever magic trick story.

"Overstuffed but great filmmaking There's a 1 hour 50 minute cut of this that would be a fantastic film. As it stands, its a little overlong and a bit of a mess in the last act with a prolonged scene towards the end that will have you wishing it would wrap up.

The technical side of the movie is excellent. Beautiful to look at, solid score, great sound & amazing acting make this a worthwhile experience. I saw someone describe the vibe as ""Elevated South Park"" and I agree in some ways.

The commentary is sort of surface level & heavy handed but on rewatch I was more able to accept it for what it was & pick up on things I missed as well.

Aster's previous Beau is Afraid had a lot I admired about it but ultimately felt more like a therapeutic allegorical exercise than a great story like Eddington.",figurative
"The Greatest Xmas Movie Of Them All My family only has 1 tradition, every year during the holiday season we all get together to watch Christmas Vacation. We have been doing this for a long time so I have watched this movie a lot and it still makes me laugh.

Its just about the perfect film much better than other xmas movies like Die Hard and Lethal Weapon!",literal
"It's Predator, just more comic book than movie! This movie was highly anticipated by me. I am a fan of not only the movie, but more importantly, the comics! Anyone who is only watching the movies, is missing the backstories and sequels to the movies. I won't make this a long winded review, you can scroll anywhere else and read those. This is more of a ""why"" to the direction of the movie.

I'm glad I allowed myself to be open to new ideas regarding the franchise. This movie played to the comics ideas of the Predator aka the Yautja, and showed actual depth to them. It's very easy to get caught up in the idea of them being a villain only, and never understanding who they're an actual villain too and why. Like running into a tiger in the woods. It could kill you and still look majestic asf later while playing with its cub lol. The movie Predator gives us the look into the culture and family life of the Yautja. You don't see human interaction or hunting of humans. You see the evolution of a Predator and why its honor and anger are so one and the same. The lust for a better hunt is explained in the comics well and now for the first time, on screen from the side of the Predator. This is again, comic driven. Yes the comics get gory and graphic, but not all of them are about that too. This was a wonderful set up for future movies to follow. The action was on point. The comedic relief was needed. It's Disney being Disney and grooming the next wave of fans. Some of the characters are added in there I believe to make this less of a monster movie and more of an action movie. We have the horror style Predators. I feel like those did very little to expand the fan base and secure it for more generations to come. The horror style played to the already existing theme that older fans wanted to see.

Go see the movie and make your own conclusions. After that, look up the comics. There's so much more story that is explained outside of the big screen.",literal
"Hilarious This show is hilarious. I laughed so hard at one point I cried. Russ has the opportunity to reinvent himself and the stuff he's come up with for Chad is absolute chaos and has me in stitches.

Doesn't take itself seriously and just great entertainment. Yes the humour is childish at times, but the show also has a lot of heart and I'm really enjoying seeing Russ/Chad's character development.

"Disappointing outing from Hughes Lonely teenagers Wyatt (Mitchell-Smith) and Gary (Hall) decide to make a woman that fits all their requirements from a computer, only to find not everything fits perfectly.

There were two words that attracted me to this high school comedy, John and Hughes. The mastermind behind the conceptual excellence of skiving school to live in Ferris Bueller's day off to the film that showcased how teenagers really felt about their suffocating parents in the Breakfast club, the man seemed to have his knowledge spot on regarding teenage life.

What emerges is a pretty standard and very degrading depiction of lonely lust, containing two teenagers who are the good guys, but are hard pushed to maintain that.

Anthony Michael Hall, a hero from the Breakfast Club, feels repetitive and loud in another role for Hughes. Mitchell-Smith likewise feels weak and a stereotype of high school repression and against Hall, we have the most conventional and boring comedy duo ever mastered, which is a great shame for a director and writer who also created some of the best teenage comedy ever.

The premise for the story sounds promising, two lads attempt to break science through some technological mastery in an attempt to fulfil their lust on a weekend away from their parents.

So after some degrading and embarrassing perversion by the lead duo on cheerleaders and a head turner away from dropped pants do the duo retreat to their sanctuary and form an hyperbole of illogical science to fulfil their uses and gratifications. Through some fast flowing wires and a bemused science guard to the pair get their just deserts.

One thing John Hughes usually does perfectly is introductions and Kelly LeBrock's opening shot is the equivalent of Megan Fox in Transformers, a slow panning from her legs upwards in a small Barbie styled costume, a beautiful introduction which is maintained through the nest few scenes as she jumps into the shower with the two lads, uses provocative gestures such as late drinking and kissing practice to keep any horny male teenager hooked.

Certainly LeBrock hits the nail on the head, acting flirtatious and forward to justify her character as perfect female, until the inevitable outcome the plot always has in mind, there is more to a person than looks tag.

Through some careful shots and repetitive music we see the story pan out as any other romantic comedy would and there are minimal surprises to generate a good watch, particularly when the humour is gross out and shamefully degrading to the actors.

The final nail in the coffin is the change in personalities of the final act and as predictable as the coming of next year will have you shaking your head.

Certainly not too much consequence came from this film as there were Ferris Bueller's amongst others to follow and create a reputation of teenage comedy mastery.",literal
"Really enjoyed this show! I understand people objecting to the ideology of some of the show, but that's not the point. I am a conservative, but to each their own. This being said, the show was really great! Mae Martin did an excellent job portraying her character. Obviously, Tony Collette was spectacular as always. Please don't review shows if you only watched part of the first episode.",literal
"Not great, but stays fresh. xXx is mediocre. While, it haves some enjoyable moments (action scenes, sex scenes etc.), plot It's mediocre. And the voice acting, is OK, but still this movie will stay always mediocre. And it haves a predictable ending, which makes it worse. However, I recommend it for action fans.

The main part of the story is poor, but it haves some incredeble moments, that really saves this movie. And by showing cool technology, It even shows some unnecessary scenes. 

Voice acting is OK. But, they really know how to do the Russian accent. 

I don't recommend this, but for action fans, maybe It's worth.

"Amazing!! I had high hopes because I love the musical and was blown away! I will definitely be seeing this again in the theater. The casting was perfect, the talent acting and singing was astounding!! I love the music and the musical and it was so hard not to sing along. Chu is such a good director and so glad they got him to direct yhis movie. It has been 10 years since I've seen the musical but he seemed to stay true to the Broadway adaption of the book. I can not wait until part 2 or when I can watch this at home and sing and dance along with the movie. Don't miss this in the theater, it is so big it needs to be experienced on the big screen. Fabulous job everyone!!!",figurative
"This is real This is, without a doubt, the most realistic ER show I've ever seen. From the depiction of gunshot wounds to the intensity of emergency scenarios, everything feels raw and authentic. Every episode has moved me to tears-some hit so hard emotionally that I found myself completely overwhelmed. One episode, in particular, struck so close to home that I was absolutely bawling.

What sets this show apart is its commitment to realism. There are no over-the-top romantic subplots or breakroom drama-just the gritty, honest reality of life in the ER. This is exactly what a medical drama should be.

HBO, you absolutely nailed it. The level of detail-from the exit wounds to the emotional weight carried by the characters-makes it all feel incredibly real. I love this show, even if it leaves me in tears every time. Bravo.",literal
"Ugh! Horrible. This is a half hour show so I guess it was supposed to be funny but the only thing that made me even crack a smile was the ankle monitor on a cheerleader. The premise made me want to watch it, but the casting was awful and the humor wasn't humorous. A little too raunchy as well. Not for me, but give it a try. Be your own judge.",literal
"Toss a coin to your witcher This has the potential to be a great show. So far I'm impressed. Season 1 feels a little disjointed, but knowing the source material, it's understandable. Henry Cavill is Geralt of Rivia, Anya Chalotra clicked as Yennifer and Freya Allan has the potential to grow into her character. Some of the design of the monsters is questionable, but overall I very much enjoyed it.",literal
"""I did it."" Maybe I don't love this film as much as some of the other commenters here, as some of the slapstick gags feel a bit laboured and some the festive joviality seems a tad forced on occasion.

But this is still a very enjoyable and eminently rewatchable holiday movie, full of warmth and humour. It is very easy to understand why it's considered essential viewing for a lot of people around this time of year.

So grab your stogie, your lineless lingerie and your well-oiled metallic sledge and let's all climb into the camper van together and relive the hilarious Christmas misadventure of the Greaseball family again. And again. And... 7/10.",literal
"This is horrendous I couldn't even finish the first episode, it was that bad. It's just inane. Not entertaining on any level. I don't understand how something this bad even gets green-lit. It reminds me of equally appalling British shows like The Job Lot and The Smoking Room, which are also unwatchable.

Tim Meadows deserves better.",literal
"What a shame...Season 17 is all Political &Covid I've been watching Grey's Anatomy since season 1. Safe to say I am a fan. For anyone who is new to the series, the first few seasons are great, naturally over the years, it's lost a bit of steam but still very watchable. However, come 2021 and I am so disappointed like never before.

The show has become very political- racism, inequality and COVID are the main themes. In as much as I am all for this...... BUT not when I just want to be entertained and watch a tv show to escape/switch off from the realities of life.

There were a few episodes this season that were not necessarily political but fell flat and boring which I put down to the issue of COVID and maybe the writers unable to use what they had initially planned for the season.

Honestly, they would have been better off skipping this year if this is what they were going to produce. Just not entertaining and fun anymore. It's become quite bleak really.

I've noticed this is not the only show that has gone down this route, few others have as well. I personally find it very frustrating. Yes let's bring about change but can we do so on a different platform.",literal
"one the best shows ever made Season 1-4 were practically perfect, there is not much to say. It had so many great moments, so many great episodes there. But then... well the writers kinda ran out of books to adapt. Season 5 and 6 were pretty boring most of the time. But they truly had their moments even having some of the best episodes of the show. Season 7 you could really see the dip in quality. Everything just felt so rushed most of it was really stupid. And then ofc. Season 8 the biggest disapointment I have ever seen. I have never seen anything more terrible. The ending was the stupidest thing i have ever seen. All of the characters were just so stupid. Everything felt even more rushed. And all the characters were basically ruined because of the writing. Overall i still give it a 9/10 just because of the first half of the show. And ofc it did still have its moments. I would still consider this show a masterpiece and I would 100% recomend. It is truly a must watch show.",figurative
"Cringe K-Pop Demon Hunters is flashy and fun-there's no denying its catchy songs and eye-popping visuals-but it ultimately feels like style without sufficient story. The emotional arcs are undercooked, the pacing erratic, and the themes undeveloped. It's a bright, shallow dazzle rather than a film with depth or staying power.",literal
"The most intense day in TV history-and it's only one shift The Pitt grabs you from the very first minute and doesn't let go. It's chaotic, packed with dense medical jargon, and yet completely engrossing from start to finish. Set in a fictional hospital in Pittsburgh, the series follows the emergency department staff through a single 15-hour shift-brilliantly stretched across 15 episodes.

The show offers a raw, unfiltered look at the everyday trials of frontline healthcare workers: understaffing, lack of resources, corporate-driven management, and the emotional toll of it all. The realism is staggering. What feels like a lifetime of events is, incredibly, just one shift for these professionals.

Exceptional writing and character development elevate the series even further. At first, the premise might seem overwhelming, but give it time-it delivers. By the end, The Pitt leaves a lasting impact and a deep appreciation for the people who hold the healthcare system together.",literal
"Fab show =) I love this show!

I had been recording this show but didn't get around to watching it, I never really felt like it as it can take time to get into a new series. However, one day when I was flicking through the channels trying to find something to watch, I came across Chicago Fire episode 10, already 15minutes in and as I watched I became hooked! I couldn't even make myself stop watching it and start from the beginning of the series! I watched episode 10 and then episode 11 the following night and then I went back and watched the series from the beginning. 

I love the story lines, and the characters are brilliant. Nobody cares if the show isn't 100% realistic, it's not a documentary! If you want realistic shows then don't watch Drama TV! It's classified 'Drama' for a reason. I can't wait for the next episode and I really hope this show keeps going for more series to come.",literal
"Great, often magnificent, series- one of the highlights of 2015 television Admittedly, not everything on television interests me. Love the detective and period drama shows, and still get much enjoyment from animation and some cookery shows, but daytime television is often littered with talk shows and evening stuff often variable soap-operas and incredibly trashy reality shows with only two exceptions.

'Poldark' interested me immediately, and right from minute one of the first episode this reviewer was absolutely hooked. There are minor flaws. Occasionally the pacing is a little off, occasionally dull and also occasionally the story can feel jumpy and rushed. Phil Davis' Jud is also played a little too straight for my liking for a character who is very funny in the books, of which the series does a laudable and actually great job adapting.

Minor flaws aside, 'Poldark' is a great and often magnificent series. And is it one of 2015 television's highlights? Yes, bar none. The series looks great and very evocative, particularly standing out is how beautifully shot it is, the Cornish scenery which ranges from the splendid to the exquisite and very striking and evocative costumes and attention to detail. The music is suitably haunting and melancholic and only used when it's needed, not being intrusive or being so spare that it's forgettable.

Writing is thoughtful and often very rich, and story-wise much it is very well paced and the drama is constantly compelling, with many harrowing and poignant dramatic parts that are too many to list. The characters are richly developed and compellingly real, the heroes are not too virtuous and actually have flaws and the villains are not stock or one-note.

Regarding the acting, that is fantastic pretty much all round with minor reservations only relating to Davis. Aiden Turner smoulders in his sex appeal and provides a haunted and brooding characterisation in the title role that is commanding and heartfelt. He shares sizzling chemistry with Eleanor Tomlinson's very touching and spirited Demelza.

In summary, not much else to add to what has been said already so well. Thoroughly enjoyed the series and it was a refreshing change to most of the shows airing now. There is even a second series due to be aired in a couple of weeks which is very much eagerly awaited. 9/10 Bethany Cox",literal
"This Thief Will Almost Steal Your Heart This enjoyable, mostly true movie may not rank as a cinematic masterpiece, but it is perfectly-crafted. Channing Tatum dominates the film with a natural and charming performance that mostly glosses over the reality that he is playing a morally bankrupt thief. Kirsten Dunst seems to get better with age, and she is thoroughly believable here. This generally buoyant movie has only two probable outcomes - the titular character will be caught and returned to prison, or he will flee the people he loves. For all the joy watching most of this movie, the ending by necessity will be something of a downer.",figurative
"Honestly pretty good for a sequel! I don't usually have much hope for sequels but this was honestly a pretty good time! I'd recommend watching the first one if you haven't already but you'd probably still have a good time without it. The actresses look great after so many years and did a phenomenal job portraying their ""swapped"" characters. Not one second was I confused who was who. Lots of genuine laughs and a few tears. Overall a good time!",figurative
"A tragic sequel to a brilliant film The whole story lacked the drive and darkness that the first one had. It felt more like National Lampoon's Vacation meets John Wick.

Instead of holding back the violence until it needs to be used, it's now used more like slapstick.

Sharon Stone's interpretation of an evil boss feels more like an interpretation of the dr. Seuss Grinchen.

Unfortunately, the film turned out to be a wasted opportunity for something truly great.",figurative
"An incredible show. This show starts out as a trashy, glossy, action-packed and very, very watchable entertainment. Successful bank heists are celebrated with a sky-dive, for no other reason than to have a very cool skydiving sequence set to pumping music.

The genius of this show is that it very, very gradually starts to deepen, uncovering layers to the main characters and slowly revealing their depths and complexities. It does this so gradually that you don't even realise it until realise you're watching some of the most beautifully-drawn characters on TV for a long time.

It then becomes as much a character- study, and a character-driven drama - as it is an action-packed heist show. The issues, plotlines and brilliant twists and turns are consistently unpredictable and original.

Some of the heists stretch credulity - as action sequences often do, but the whole thing is so skillfully-woven that it doesn't matter - you happily buy into the lack of believability in the heist/action sequences, because they're so well integrated into the brilliant character studies and first-class storytelling.

The casting is perfect - everyone is bringing their A-game but Shawn Hatosy is astonishing and Ellen Barkin is hitting a career best.

It's a Breaking Bad-level achievement, possibly exceeding it at times. One that flew under the radar.",literal
"Hoping it improves 🤞 The first episode feels lazy - the writing is cliche and almost camp at times and the ""creature"" isn't scary. Dialogue, green screen usage and acting (mainly the adults) leave for a sub-par show so far; the scene at the military base with the guys wearing gas masks is beyond stupid. Needs to improve or I'm out but the fact it's an origin story makes me think there's going to be a lot of filler.",literal
"Slow... slow.. oh wait!... nope, still slow. But maybe good? I must admit - the idea behind this show is quite original and Apple did a phenomenal job creating this world and making it look incredibly believable... like something that could actually exist for real. The cinematography is great, the production is great, the writing... is good, the acting is great... Not really many bad things I could say about this other than the super slow pace at which it moves. It's not really until the last episode that things get exciting. There were a lot of scenes that didn't really go anywhere but from what I understand they will be explained in the 2nd season which is now apparently on pause so may not even happen. I was quite disappointed with the massive cliffhanger at the end of season 1. I felt like I spent all that time watching this show and then in the end - nothing. Not cool!",literal
"Ed Gein story review, atrociously made I loved the first season of Monster, the Dahmer story - was fantastic. The second one on the Menendez family was a decent watch too. I was looking forward to getting to know the Ed Gein story, as I had heard of him, but watching this season, what an absolute mess of a series.

The series lets us know that many epic Horror movies made were actually inspired by Ed Gein, e.g. Psycho, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, which ok is good to know BUT there are episodes spent cutting to these movies being made, taking us back to the movie set, casting, making of those movies......why?? We don't need so much time spent on such things, we are watching to get to know the Ed Gein story. These break aways to such scenes were totally unnecessary.

The other downside to this is the time spent on fiction, it doesn't exactly give us factual Ed Gein storylines, instead a lot of time is spent on characters such as Adaline (who was real) but we get led down a path of fiction, focusing on Adaline, and what she did, going off to NYC, etc, which is not based on any solid facts at all.

My review is as poorly constructed as this 3rd Season of Monster. I got through all episodes but can safely say it was one of the worst things I've ever seen on Netflix. Take nothing away from the main actors performance as Ed Gein, he was great.

Whoever signed this off, hang your heads in shame.",literal
"What is supposed to be a joke, honestly leads to perfection One Punch Man is obviously selfaware, and meant to be over the top and funny. But it honestly is still a badass, superhero show. I wish their were more episodes, this show could go on so much longer by showing more of the side characters. Everyone is so interesting. I fully understand now why people always recommend this show to people just getting into Anime. The English dub is very good as well, the voice acting fits the characters very well.",literal
"Who polices the police? Good entertainment. Having said that, most of the officers would have been dismissed had they had the issues and the lack of self control and poor judgement that these officers have. Does no credit to the police. I truly hope that the series is in no way representative of the NYPD SVU.",literal
"Solid, but surprisingly average... The movie is definitely not a disaster. You're not sitting there thinking ""wow, what a trainwreck."" The action hits, a few set pieces are genuinely exciting, and technically the movie is solid. But by the time the credits roll, it all feels surprisingly generic, especially considering who directed it.

Edgar Wright is usually a guy with a really recognizable style; very sharp editing, playful visual flair, a real sense of personality. But here it honestly feels like the studio sanded most of that off. The whole thing comes across weirdly safe and standard, like a ""we don't want to scare anyone"" studio project. If his name wasn't on it, I'm not sure you'd even guess it was him. It feels more like work-for-hire than something he was burning to make.

The good stuff first: when the movie goes into full action mode, it works. The chases and fights are shot clearly, you can tell what's going on, there's some good impact, and it's rarely boring while bullets are flying. The other big positive is Glenn Powell as Ben Richards. He really carries the film. He sells that mix of desperate dad who just wants to save his family and slightly unhinged guy who actually stands a chance in this rigged death game. You do end up wanting him to make it through and at the same time enjoy watching him tear into the hunters and this messed-up system.

The world itself is also cool in theory: a dystopian future where a media mega-corporation basically runs the country, a show called 'The Running Man' where three contestants are turned into public enemies through AI-generated videos and propaganda so the whole world hates them and wants them dead, and they're hunted by both regular citizens and professional killers. If they survive a month, they get a billion dollars and a new life. Ben signs up because his daughter is sick, he got blacklisted from every job for trying to do the right thing, and now he can't even afford basic medicine. The media/propaganda angle is not subtle at all - it's very on-the-nose; but that's fine, the concept can handle being blunt.

On top of that, the tone is all over the place. The world they're showing here really calls for a more serious, heavier approach: poverty, desperation, public executions as entertainment, a father throwing himself into a death show to save his kid... it's dark stuff. But the movie keeps dropping in jokes and light banter. It's not full-on Marvel quip spam, but it's enough to keep undercutting the seriousness. And the problem is, most of the jokes aren't even that funny.

You can also feel the strain of trying to stay closer to the Stephen King book. On paper that's a smart move and it definitely has nothing to do with the cheesy 80s Schwarzenegger version beyond the basic premise. But on screen it sometimes plays like they tried to cram in as many book elements as possible without giving them enough time to breathe. That leads to some bloat, weird pacing, and a general sense of ""there's a better, tighter version of this story hiding in here somewhere.""

As a straightforward action movie, it's watchable and even pretty fun in parts. You get good action, a strong lead performance, and an interesting world that's at least engaging on a surface level. But if you walk in expecting a new Edgar Wright classic, you're almost guaranteed to walk out disappointed. As a random action flick, it's ""okay to good."" As an Edgar Wright movie, it's firmly on the weaker end of his filmography. For me, it is entertaining enough for one viewing, but nowhere near as good as it could've been.",figurative
"One of the best movies of the year After being trailer after trailer at the cinema for what seems the whole year, I was fearing this would be a total flop.

I need not have worried because this is an action packed, well scripted remake of the original.

Everyone is cast perfectly and all performances are great.

It keeps you guessing throughout the movie and the twists and turns keep it going.

Thoroughly enjoyed it. Well worth a visit.",literal
"Wild Ride Without Any Depth Sisu is a Finnish historical fiction action film inspired by the works of Nicolas Winding Refn and Quentin Tarantino. This movie features a quiet, isolated and gritty protagonist facing dangerous challenges as in the movie Valhalla Rising and the movie is subdivided into different chapters introducing new locations, characters and sudden outbursts of violence as in The Hateful Eight. The story revolves around a former Finnish soldier living isolated in Lapland after having lost his family. When he finds gold, he decides to ride to the next town in order to exchange said gold to lots of money. However, several Nazi soldiers come across him and make the simple mission a seemingly impossible challenge.

This movie convinces on several levels. First and foremost, the stunning isolated landscapes of Lapland are a thing of beauty if you favour the wilderness of the northern hemisphere. Up next, the quiet protagonist certainly has a certain rough charme that will make viewers root for him. The side characters varying from sadistic Nazi soldiers to rebellious female prisoners add some spice to the movie. The action scenes are quite brutal but also exaggerated in a way that will provide some laughs throughout the movie. Especially the scenes in the river are quite memorable in that regard. The film's showdown is completely over the top and will have genre fans crying tears of joy.

On the negative side, the film's plot is extremely predictable as it has been done time and time again in the past. The movie is also completely exaggerated and throws any attempts at historical accuracy violently out of the window right from the start. At times, this movie feels more like a video game in the key of Far Cry.

At the end of the day, Sisu is worth being enjoyed once at a local theatre with plenty of cineasts applauding, cheering and laughing throughout the film. If that isn't possible for you, make sure to watch this film with a friend and a selection of fine drinks. Switch your brain off and go along for the ride. Once the wild ride is over however, there is no interest in going on it again. This is why I wouldn't recommend purchasing this film. Sisu is no memorable highlight but a brutal action flick that should be enjoyed by its target audience.",figurative
"Overstayed its welcome years ago I used to LOVE this show. Like many, I was sad when Stabler left and kept hoping he'd return but, hey, at least we still had Munch, Cragen and Fin. The show should've ended when Munch and Cragen left. Since then, it seems the sole purpose of this show is to surpass the record set by the FAR SUPERIOR original ""Law & Order"" which NEVER should've ended (or, at least been given the proper send-off it deserved). The last several years of SVU have been completely unwatchable. Not because of the so-called ""leftist propoganda"" some viewers have accused but because the writing, acting, and overall feel and tone of the show has descended to the immeasurably low quality formerly found only in embarrassingly inferior ""Law & Order"" wannabe franchises (CSI, NCIS, Criminal Minds, et al).

This show doesn't deserve to have the record for longevity when the quality has been sorely lacking for at least the last 1/3 of its run. Just END it already!",figurative
"Freaky - But til the end To be honest, I wanted it to be as good, if not better than the first in this series of ""switch up"" movies I've watched over the years. At first, when the flick started, it was like a lot of others, slooooow - and it sadly stayed that way for nearly the first 40 mins of the film. And as I sat thru, what I began seeing as another train wreck, I thought this film should've went straight to Disney+

But, after the first hour (which it should not have taken that long to gain my attention) the film got gradually better. But, it was not til the final 30 mins when the film began to win me over. Was it Disney's best - far from it, but once it showed itself to have a bit of ""heart"" it was a fun watch.",figurative
"emtaha ""Breaking Bad,"" truly one of the best TV shows in history, masterfully blends suspense and drama, leaving viewers intrigued. With Vince Gilligan's creative genius, you find yourself breathless as you watch an ordinary chemistry teacher, Walter White, unexpectedly descend into a life of crime. The rising tension in each episode, the depth of the characters, and the twists in the story keep the audience glued to the screen. Bryan Cranston's unforgettable performance and the show's compelling storytelling make ""Breaking Bad"" not just a series, but a masterpiece. That's why I highly recommend this amazing series to all of you.",figurative
"Season one was a masterpiece, but season two felt like just an ordinary show The first season had a simple yet deep story, with cleverly written events and details. The focus on Wednesday's character, brought to life by Jenna Ortega's strong performance, made the series truly captivating.

In contrast, while the writers created an interesting story for season two, the excessive additions and some unnecessary events that quickly resolved created a sense of over-expansion and confusion, which took away the charm that season one had.",figurative
"Seriously one of my favorite shows right now. It really gets your adrenaline going, and I do like how every story line is different but still relates somehow. Coming from a daughter of an law enforcement officer, it's a great show and I tend to always love cop shows. I hope they keep continuing with the show and hope to see a third season.",literal
"A beautiful horror A genuinely notable adaptation that treats the source material with thoughtful passion and clear reverence. Anchored by a truly stunning gothic backdrop and faultless cinematography, every frame is a visual feast. The acting ensemble delivers seamlessly integrated performances that never falter. This film sets a new standard for Frankenstein adaptations and deserves to be mentioned alongside Shelley's novel itself. Seeing the premiere at the British Film Festival in London, the grand scale of the big-screen viewing was utterly engrossing.",literal
"Now, this is a game show! Are you bored with all those lame shows like Survivor and The Amazing Race? Then, we have a reality show for you. I bet this would be the number one show on TV. Nothing else would be close. People could get their hatred of criminals satisfied every night.

Arnie is back with a hit that came out long before all this reality TV. He plays the same character that he does in Commando, the Terminator series, and other shows. Nothing new. If you like Arnie, then you will like this show. If you don't, well...

Where has the hot Cuban beauty Maria Conchita Alonso been? I haven't seen here since this film. Arnie is one lucky guy. I hope his wife wasn't watching. :-) Oh, our Family Feud host (Richard Dawkins) was cast perfectly in his last movie. Since Feud started a year after this movie, I bet someone else thought so too.",literal
"The Apple didn't fell far... *The Black Phone* was a well-chosen film within its genre. It has a dense narrative structure and a harsh, straightforward theme, where young people and children were relentlessly crushed - yet, in defiance, they fought back. In this context, a sequel is both a risk and an opportunity. In my opinion, it does not disappoint and stands as an interesting continuation of the original. It remains to be seen whether this is, in fact, the Grabber's final waltz.",literal
"DAYUMMMMMM!!!! This show wasted NO time amping up the scare factor. DAYUMMM!!!!

This is going to be one hell of a series. From the normal looking family offering one of the protagonists a ride in freezing winter to the buildup on all the main characters (all children) meeting in ways not so coincidental, they were smart to release this just before Halloween.

Stephen King's brand of horror is so effective because it doesn't depend on haunted houses. His horror happens (mainly) in Maine, or New Hampshire, and New England in general, is the perfect setting for horror, as the population is so sparse, and there are so many small towns in New Hampshire and Maine. You never know WHAT is watching you, do you?

Couple that with the 1962 setting - long before any of the modern conveniences, when we still had telephone booths every 4 blocks and not enough street lights, this setting in rural New England should make you look over your shoulder a few times. It scared me and I am now in the GREAT grandpa stage, and i remember when the original Dracula was scary. This show definitely keeps up with anything from that era, when all horror was in black and white.

Yeah, Baby!",literal
"started to get old Really enjoyed the show at first but then the constant screw ups by members of Dwight's group especially Tyson just got too frustrating. How would I guy that just spent 25 years in prison put up with all those people constantly messing up? Every time Dwight steps away one of them goes against his orders, takes matters into their own hands and/or runs their mouth about sensitive info. All of which jeopardizes either everything Dwight is building, his life or his freedom? Liked the premise and not sure if Taylor is or ever was doing the writing but they need to re-evaluate the story lines and remember what the central characters background is. Not sure if I'll continue watching or not. Definitely my least favorite Sheridan series. I mean the writing quality of this compared to Lioness is crazy.",literal
"Weapons Is Messed Up in the Best Way, Creative, Disturbing, and Surprisingly Funny From the director of Barbarian, Weapons delivers one of the most intriguing, interesting, and downright messed-up horror thrillers of the year, it takes a bold and compelling approach to storytelling, one that may not work for every viewer, but i personally found it both creative and engaging, the film presents different perspectives from various characters within the same timeline, and it adds a unique structure that pays off when everything connects at the end.

If i had any issues, it would be that the film feels just a bit too long, and there's one character whose arc didn't feel as compelling as the others, though i wouldn't say i dislike or hate the characters.

The rest of Weapons is as intense and weird as you'd expect, yet surprisingly funny, somehow the humor lands without undercutting the disturbing tension that runs throughout, the performances are great across the board, and Zach Cregger direction proves once again that he knows how to deliver smart, stylish horror without relying on cheap jump scares.

Overall, i do think Barbarian is a better movie but Weapons is still a good second feature from Cregger, a strong follow-up that shows Cregger is a director worth watching, i had a good time with it.",literal
"Munch The soul of this show. He was not in most of the episodes in the incredibly long run of the program. But when he was, Belzer often was written as the most interesting character. His sense of morality and what is Right balanced the show. Munch loved his coworkers and had a marvelous sense of justice even with the (sensible) conspiracy thoughts. He Always cared about the children in the best ways - Munch knew who mattered in any situation in a program that consistently entertains & tells relevant stories.

Rarely was he featured. Some of the greatest episodes happened when he was.

I wish that he was still alive to receive the additional praise his work deserves.",literal
"Had Me In the First Half *Written after watching the season 19 finale* Grey's Anatomy started as such an incredible show. It had heart, was clever, and really got you invested in the lives of each character. Each season got better and better for years as a world was created around our favorite hospital and cast members moved in and out of our lives. Watching an episode makes you feel that you are in the hospital, working alongside your friends. This was truly a treat to watch and I wish I could continue saying that about the current seasons. Around season 10, there became a drastic dip in quality. Many of the original cast had since left the show and were replaced with characters that had no character, just 1 or 2 qualities that ruled their existence. The writing tanked, the acting became subpar, and the characters all became shells of who they once were. It saddens me to continue watching this show as it now feels like your group of friends have all lost their minds in a disappointing manner. Each season brings my opinion on this show lower and lower and I yearn for the days before it went downhill. I would love for this show to get cancelled, just to finally put these characters to rest and stop desecrating their near decade long dead corpses. That is the most respectable thing to do at this point.",literal
"Average show but stop! The historical inaccuracies are lazy. STOP!, with the needless diversity and inclusion. Little John was not black and you didn't need to check that box. Nobody is going to watch this show because Little John is black but people will not watch it because of this. People will also not watch because of all the historical inaccuracies.",literal
"A Heartfelt Look at a Forgotten President It really impressed me, especially the acting by Michael Shannon and Matthew Macfadyen. Shannon's take on James Garfield is refreshing-he's not your usual politician but a genuine guy who just wants to do good work without playing the usual political games. He feels like a simple family man with big ideas. Macfadyen nails the role of Charles Guiteau, one of the creepiest villains we've seen recently.

Even though the story happened almost 150 years ago, it hits close to home. It shows how anyone trying to change the political system for the better faces serious pushback from those who want to keep things the way they are. They twist public opinion to make the changemakers look like the bad guys. Garfield's story deserves way more attention, and hopefully, this show helps with that. It's a shame his time as president was so short. History tends to remember the ""smart boys"" instead of the good-hearted ones, which is a real loss. The show also reminds us how important modern medicine is-Garfield might have lived longer with proper healthcare, but back then, that wasn't the case.

One of the best parts is seeing the real love between Garfield and his wife, Crete. They really had each other's backs through everything, and their support adds a lot of heart to the story. It's a beautiful reminder that behind every great leader is someone just as strong. In the end, the series tells us you don't need to be a hero to make a difference-just a decent person willing to stand up and sacrifice a bit to do what's right.

And hey, the soundtrack? Spot on. It's mostly in the background but really sets the mood without getting in the way.",literal
"What would it be if made now and actually follow the novel? Like other reviews already said, The Running Man hits many very actual notes - especially in the '20s we're living in. The use of deep fakes, the reality tv formats, the manipulation that was predicted for 2019 is all there nowadays. But what if this novel by the brilliant Stephen King would've been adapted again? So no blockbuster entertainment but how it was intended by King? That means no Schwarzenegger as the main character was a weak loser type. No 'game arena' but running in the actual world. Formats like this are already there, a new movie adaptation would be awesome right? This film shows the potentional and needs to be told again. But then true to the original idea. I'd love to see that.",literal
"Sack them, just sack them Whoever came up with this House meeting Pecky Blinder nonsense should be sacked.

It was never going to fly and the acting and chosen actors doesn't help it either.

So they take old scripts from House MD scrip our all the humour, all the decent medical stuff, add in some character from Sherlock Holmes and give a Peaky Blinder sidekick and simply put them in a room with a supposed ill person.

Come on people, your time is worth more than this and mean certainly is. This is the worst thing since Crossroad. Nothing here tempts me to watch another episode, in fact I lasted less then 30 mins in the first one. I want my time back please.",literal
You need funny people This show is supposed to be a comedy however it doesn't have any funny people in it. It has a couple old women with absolutely terrifying faces due to all the Botox and surgery plus a failed SNL actor. What does that result in?

"Stellar performances, yet unpleasant viewing As ""Die My Love"" (2025 release; 119 min.) opens, we get to know a young couple, Jackson and expecting Grace, as they settle in their remote country home. They are madly and lustily in love. The baby boy delivered by Grace brings instant joy. We then shift to a pre-birth family gathering with Jackson's mom and uncle... At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie.

Couple of comments: this is the latest from director Lynne Ramsay (""We Need to Talk About Kevin""). Also important to note is that Martin Scorsese produced this (and brought the novel on which this is based to Jennifer Lawrence's attention). I will be frank to admit having conflicted feelings about this movie. On the one hand, I can readily see, and appreciate, the stellar performances, first and foremost by Jennifer Lawrence, whom i already predict will not only get another Best Actress Oscar nomination but likely will win it too. I've never seen Robert Patterson acting better. Sissy Spacek, as Jackson's mother, is likely to get (and certainly should get) a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination. The original score (co-written by Lynne Ramsay I might point out) and the song placements are terrific. Then why did I not enjoy this movie more than I did? Because frankly there is nothing much to be joyful about in this movie. Grace's behavior descends into (mental) hell, and I felt bad, and uncomfortable, watching it all unfold. Yes, Jenifer Lawrence is brilliant in portraying it, but that does not do anything to lighten the situation. In fact one might argue it only deepens the situation. When the movie's closing credits started tunning, I was frankly relieved that it was over (although I never contemplated leaving the theater before the end).

""Die My Love"" premiered at this year's Cannes Film Festival to considerable critical acclaim, and rightfully so. The movie is currently rated 76% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes and I can certainly understand that rating, even if my own viewing experience is slightly lower than that. The movie opened in US theaters this weekend. The screening where I watched it here in Cincinnati early Sunday evening was not attended well (about 10 people), and its opening weekend box office (less than $3 million across the country) does not bode well for a long theatrical run. If you are in the mood for a movie experience that is definitely not your mainstream one, or you are simply a fan of Jennifer Lawrence or Robert Patterson, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",figurative
"good movie This was a good movie.  I didn't understand some things completely, but that was okay (as far as historical background).  The only thing I thought wasn't necessary was the rape scene.  It could have been left out more, and implied more.  Otherwise, the movie was worth every minute of the 2 hours and 22 minutes, and the subtitles didn't bother me, even though I missed a few seconds of the words because I was busy musing over the cinematography, which was so beautiful.  I didn't get bored during any scenes at all, and many movies have approx. 4 scenes total where I get bored.  This movie has a good love story in it, too.  Was fitting for Valentine's Day.",literal
"Odd French horror film In 18th century France, Gregoire de Fronsac (Samuel Le Bihan) and his Indian companion Mani (Mark Dacascos) try to capture a beast which is killing people in a remote village.  That's the main plot, but there are many others thrown in.  Among the elements put in--a love story; politics (LOTS of it); racism; incest; rape; murder; gratuitous female nudity and kick-boxiing!  A few of the fight scenes would not be out of place in a Jackie Chan movie.

**SPOILERS AHEAD**

Basically, this film is all over the map...way too much.  The film tries to cover too much material (and characters), it runs over 2 1/2 hours and there are HUGE plot holes (the explanation of the beast makes no sense and one character is killed and then brought back to life, yet we're never told how or why!).

On the plus side it is well done and Dacascos' Mani is a very interesting, complex character (as Dacascos is a good actor, is very handsome and has a great body).  Le Bihan is OK as Fronsac.  Also Monica Bellucci is on hand looking great, giving a wonderful performance and really boosting the movie.

So, it's too long, too serious, too plot-heavy but somewhat worth seeing for the fight scenes, the beast (which is incredible), Dacascos and Bellucci.",literal
"A quest for lost redemption and understanding. Douglas Sirk is often praised some 50 years after his career ended for being one of the most subversive and bittersweet of Hollywood directors of the 1950s. Born in Germany, he began his film career in the German cinema, only to flee when the Nazis took control. By the mid 1940s, he was a full-fledged Hollywood director assigned by studios to churn out as many films as possible. However, even after all these years, it is clear that like fellow immigrant directors Billy Wilder and Ernst Lubitsch, there was a dark undertone in all of Sirk's works that continues to amaze today.

The first of Sirk's most well-known films was Magnificent Obsession, a glossy Technicolor melodrama that on the surface appears to be as soapy and exploitative as any daytime television drama. However, many critics and scholars in recent years have instructed us to look closer, to try and understand the hidden meanings and undertones of such a story. Clearly, it is obvious that Sirk used such a decor and platform as that was what he was given to work with. Melodramas were becoming quite popular in the 1950s, this itself being a reflection of the growing artifice and superficial decadence that would come to characterize postwar America. Sirk, being a European immigrant, would know and recognize this better than almost anyone. Therefore, he brilliantly used American settings, characterizations and story lines to subject to American audiences the very ideas and social graces he saw through. Just as expected, people fell for the bait and came in droves to witness what they though was simply a tearjerker exploring the relationship between a spoiled rich playboy and a well-meaning widow of a revered doctor.

Though it may be impossible to truly grasp all of Sirk's secrets after just one viewing, it seems to me that one of the critiques most notable here is the motivation these characters possess. Another reviewer described this film as a quest for spirituality. Redemption and understanding may also be added to this list as nearly all of these characters attempt to find consolation and faith in things that reflect their own artificial emotion and feelings. Do any of these characters truly have a moral center that guides their everyday actions? Or are they simply living out of guilt, fear, jealousy and self-loathing? These are loaded questions to be sure, but the more I write the more I am convinced that Magnificent Obsession is a loaded film.",literal
"No thanks I couldn't make it thru the first episode. Wooden acting, uninteresting characters, and a plot worthy of a bad 1970's movie of the week.

And Amy. Are we supposed to feel sympathy for her? What a horrible person. If I ever had a doctor speak to me that way I'd be speaking to her superiors and filing a complaint... at the very least.",literal
"Intricate police work in an exciting setting This is the living proof we can still make good cop shows today: Most episodes are well paced, and few if any scene feel unnecessary. The scenario for each season is complex, built around very different mysteries and a cast of colourful but credible secondary characters. It is neither soapy nor trying to be funny, it keeps the 'spiritual' element in the distant background, it does not reinvent the genre but does a great job of projecting it in its unusual setting: the reservation is a living and concrete community, with its insiders and outsiders, its institutions and traditions. We get a strong sense of couleur locale without ever feeling on a guided tour. Politics and history are broached sensitively without being preachy, and I (a European who, as far as I know, never met a native American) feel after two seasons like I have some minimal sense of Indian daily life in the seventies, and an emotional connection to the dilemmas and ambivalences of Indian identity. Doubtlessly it is primarily because of the fine writing (terse and occasionally punchy) and the excellent cast (Joe, Bernadette and Chee are all remarkably acted).",literal
"A Childhood Classic I've recently introduced my son to this classic and he enjoys it just as much as I do.

It's not going to make cinematic history, but that's not its goal. It's a feel-good movie that can be watched as a family. And it greatly succeeds in that.

Just watch and enjoy. Don't over-analyze. Remember what was great about being a kid.

The boys' adventures are things we all might have done, once upon a time, if we were lucky enough to live in a kids' neighborhood.

I like that the cast is a mix of any kids who may come together. They don't all match like cookie cutters. The ""bad language"" is tame enough for me to watch with my son, but still add a smidge bit of naughtiness.

Just watch out for The Beast.",literal
"Awful and bad message for kids! What a rotten Christmas movie. I have avoided watching it for years, angry that every wonderful little thing from the 60s must be redone and RUINED by Disney. This grinch is abandoned by his father because his mother slept with her boss? Really, this belongs in a Disney movie? Then he is apparently adopted, bullied in school and so runs away. Sweet little Cyndy Lu wants to save him and invites him down to town, and when he comes he sees his adoptive parents and says ""you're still alive?"" That's it! No emotions or love anywhere. Then, he morphs into an awful monster because of more bullying by the town. Got the message kids? Monsters are always created by bullying, never by wrong choices! If you can get past this you have a stomach stronger than mine.

Terrible, terrible messages for little kids unfortunate enough to be subjected to this sad, long and terrible movie. The original animated one is lovely. THAT is the one that everyone should watch. Last, the movie suggests that you can be terrible, rotten, criminal and cruel for a long long time and it's going to be okay in the end. Haven't even finished the movie yet and shaking my head. Two points because Anthony Hopkins is always a joy.",literal
"Flogging a Slow Horse When you see so many positive reviewers feeling the need to refer defensively to the bad reviews and contradict them, you know something is wrong with a show or a movie. And so it proves to be the case here. You do stick with it to see what happens, but mainly it becomes a hate watch. Ruth doing her usual impression of Mr Toad and making even worse decisions than he ever did, posh Emma doing her darndest to be common (a fully paid up member of the Dick Van Dyke appreciation Society). All those scary black men! You can tell from the start Mrs. Baddiel is involved.

Early on we have the nasty posh man wiping his hand on his trousers after shaking hands with a black man. SLEDGEHAMMER PLEASE! I want to make a point! We have ultra badass Emma (she wears a long leather coat and boots, that's how we know she's BADASS) telling a priest to F Off on her way to the police station where she makes the officers look sooooo silly, because she's cool and clever and has all the answers. It helps that the scriptwriters have provided the officers with the dumbest lines this side of Car 54 Where Are You? And then there's the Malcolm Tucker clone... My, how we love our fancy talking politicos swearing their heads off! The makers of The Thick of It should be bending m'learned friend's ear as we speak.

Utter trash, but yes, I'll watch it to the end.",literal
"I don't like Maggie There were a few episodes when she left and the show was better. I don't think it's realistic or reasonable to expect us to believe that the head of the FBI ""goes by Maggie's feelings.. her gut tells her something so that's the way they proceed. I like the character OA when Haley from Chicago PD was partnered with him. I think Maggie should go in another mission and leave the show. I am on the fence about the woman running the department because she so often goes with feelings instead of facts. The other team (black woman and white man) are much more believable and portray a better partnership. Just not a fan of the Maggie character at all!",literal
"The Bear, but in a hospital. The Pitt is medical drama done right.

At 15 episodes long, the first season of The Pitt spans 15 hours of a single shift in the Emergency Department of the Pittsburgh Trauma Medical Centre. It feels like one long, continuous movie, with each episode covering an hour of that shift. This storytelling device does wonders in conveying the stress and trauma these medical professionals endure every day.

Amidst all the chaos, the show does an impeccable job of fleshing out its characters-without relying on flashbacks (apart from a few brief memory sequences of the lead character) or showing their lives outside the hospital. Every doctor, nurse, and even most of the patients are treated as distinct, fully realized individuals. As a viewer, you feel what these characters are experiencing in every moment. A lot of the credit goes to the outstanding ensemble cast, who play their roles to perfection.

Another standout aspect of the show is how detailed and realistic everything feels. The creators have done a tremendous job crafting the sets with modern medical equipment and presenting believable medical cases for the doctors to handle. It also excels in representation, with a diverse cast and storylines that never feel forced or out of place.

The Pitt is one of those shows that came out of nowhere and completely took me by surprise with how good it is. I'm extremely hyped for the next season and hope it maintains its quality-and keeps its promise of delivering a new season each year.",literal
"Stilted, effusive, and Baroque rather than Gothic, it bears all the hallmarks of its director I could go on for only 30 minutes, then I gave it up, to be honest. Forced scenes with surreal, otherworldly costumes, so far-fetched from contemporary reality, and unnecessarily over-the-top acting made me very uneasy from the very start. It is obviously the director's mistake, not the actor's. I reckon he thinks he made something extraordinary, but there he failed spectacularly. It is everything but.",literal
"really grew on me I wasn't sure if I was going to make it past the second episode, but I stuck with it, and boy am I glad I did.

"A Quiet Masterpiece That Echoes the Madness of Our Time Eddington floored me. It's one of those rare films that sits with you long after the credits roll-quietly unsettling, yet deeply human. There are shades of No Country for Old Men here-not just in tone, but in its sense of looming unease, moral ambiguity, and the way it lets silence say as much as dialogue.

What struck me most was how the film subtly evokes the chaos and psychological weight of the pandemic era. It doesn't do it overtly, but the mood, the isolation, the strange behavior of people under pressure-it all brought me back to that surreal time. Eddington doesn't shout; it whispers. And in doing so, it captures something profound about fear, loneliness, and the way the world can unravel without warning.

The performances are understated and strong, and the direction is bold in its restraint. Every frame feels intentional. Every pause meaningful.

If you're looking for an action-packed thriller, this isn't it. But if you're looking for something thoughtful, intense, and strangely cathartic-Eddington delivers. I loved it.",figurative
"The Future is Here This film would have been finished early in the current administration's reign of terror, so the resemblance to reality is a sort-of-coincidence.

That said, the whole movie is a straight-up look at how violence is a way to destruction.

Early scenes set up the premise, and everything else, as strange as each scene may look, leads to the end.

Great acting throughout, and I think Sean Penn should get another Oscar nomination from this. PTA often sets his movies in the past, like in Licorice Pizza or There Will Be Blood. This film, loosely adapted from Pynchon's Vineland shows how these characters move from one stage of their lives to another.

The struggle is the journey and the path, never clear, leads us on.",figurative
"Cinematic brilliance What a film! This is quite possibly the best work I've seen from both Emma Stone and Jesse Plemons. Every moment with either of them on screen was captivating and had me on the edge of my seat. Delbis was so charming in their performance of Don, and it was a welcome surprise to see Stavy in a cinematic role as well.

I loved the direction of this film, and I will definitely be checking out more of Lanthimos' works in the future. The cinematography was excellent, capturing tone while not giving too much away in certain scenes (you know which ones).

The score! Theatrical is the word that comes to mind. It is interwoven in such a way to give transitional moments a dramatic flair while giving the tense, intimate moments more feelings of suspense and dread. Jerskin Fendrix deserves a round of applause for this one.

The premise is nothing short of brilliant. Conspiracies are so prevalent in the modern age of technology and social media, but this one takes the cake. Alien invasion has always been something I've like to toy with in my mind, and I've consumed a lot of fictional works based around that throughout my life. But this story takes it to another level, entangling with the delusion that has come out of the echo chambers we all find ourselves in while surfing the web. Again, brilliant.

If this doesn't win some Oscar's then I'd be shocked. One of the best films of the year hands down. 9.5/10

Oh, and I'm on the side of the Andromedans.",literal
My favourite series The last season is a complete ruin I agree. But I enjoyed the Westros so much that even the disappointment in the end doesn't make me feel anything bad about GoT. It's just the writers' fault as they ran out of source material for the last 2 seasons. But this was the series that hooked me so much and you can't watch without falling in love with it. Everything was so good at the start and even without a satisfying ending... Idc I love GoT and moreover the Cast was perfect... Just perfect.. I love Game of Thrones and I'll watch anything that will come in the future related to that. Thank you! Have a nice day btw :),literal
"Great start, hard to keep up for that long The start was amazing the first two seasons were brilliant. Up untill season 11 it was still super amazing but with all the cast change less and less point to watch. The stories also are less realistic and something might changed.",literal
"I didn't read the book but I didn't read the book, so I went into the film not knowing the plot. Everyone is talking about Mason and McKenna. To me, it was just another annoying unhinged teenage trope that may have been a bit overused imo but perhaps it is or isn't according to the novel. Their chemistry is palpable to the point where you felt their sense of grief and betrayal. David Franco was a great casting choice. The film holds up well with his portrayal along with his chemistry with Allison Williams. The audience feels the grief between Dave Franco and Allison Williams' characters.",literal
"Unapologetic Oscar Bait William Shakespeare is widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language, though there's some disagreement about whether he actually wrote the materials attributed to him. Even sketchier than this are some of the details about his personal life, aspects of his character that have been the subject of much conjecture, especially where they may have influenced his literary undertakings. And an examination of that nexus is where this latest offering from writer-director Chloé Zhao makes its appearance on the stage (or, in this case, the screen). Based on the best-selling speculative novel Hamnet by Maggie O'Farrell (who co-wrote the screenplay with Zhao), the film presents a fictional take on how the Bard's most noteworthy work, the quintessential theatrical tragedy, Hamlet, came into being. Essentially, the narrative maintains that the stage play (which, in Shakespeare's time, used the names ""Hamlet"" and ""Hamnet"" interchangeably) came about as a grief/coping response after the author (Paul Mescal) and his wife, Agnes (Jessie Buckley), lost their young son, Hamnet (Jacobi Jupe), to ""the pestilence"" (assumed to be bubonic plague). It's presumed that the tragic but heroic Hamlet is a fictional homage to Shakespeare's courageous, honorable but ill-fated real life progeny (though, admittedly, it's something of a stretch to understand what connection an 11-year-old boy from rural England might have to a prince of the Danish royal family). Bringing the play to life often led to marital discord between Will and Agnes, given that he was working on the production in London while she maintained the family household in Stratford-on-Avon. And, all the while, the couple struggled to come to terms with their feelings of loss, something that Shakespeare hoped to resolve by creating this latest work. As noble as this sentiment might be (and as truly effectively as it's addressed in the picture's closing 15 minutes), the overall execution otherwise leaves much to be desired. To its credit, ""Hamnet"" features superb performances (particularly by Buckley and Noah Jupe as Hamlet, though Mescal comes across as a bit hammy at times), along with a fine score, stunning visuals and an excellent period piece production design. But, even with all these assets in its favor, this release is sorely in need of editing and a better script, one with fewer repetitious and incongruent elements (most notably the clumsy integration of original Shakespearean on-stage dialog with contemporary off-stage exchanges). These shortcomings, regrettably, make for an often-dull tale, one that prompted a number of viewers at the screening I attended to start nodding off - literally. What's more, the screenplay would appear to assume that most audience members have an intimate familiarity with both the minutiae of the play and the details of Shakespeare's biography, inferences that ask an awful lot of viewers upon entering the theater. Indeed, when all is said and done, ""Hamnet"" truly is a major disappointment, an unapologetic example of Oscar bait, a picture that holds itself in bloated esteem simply because of its lofty attributes and subject matter. But that kind of unrepentant cinematic preening has grown tiresome over time, even though it's a formula that this filmmaker never shies away from employing in her productions - and this offering, unfortunately, is once again no exception.",literal
"Review Jurassic World: Rebirth tries to reignite the franchise but stumbles hard. The story is weak, and the all-new cast feels hollow, often referencing past events the audience never saw. While the visuals - especially the D-Rex - are impressive, the creature itself lacks originality, adding little beyond a large head. A potentially powerful ending scene is ruined by an off-screen survival that defies logic. The music remains solid, echoing past entries, and a family side plot had potential but lacked growth or real tension. With almost no connection to the parks, it barely feels like a Jurassic film.",literal
Pretty Good Powell is pretty funny in this. Surprisingly good because it could have easily been pretty bad. Acting is good and the plot actually moves right along. Football sequences are ok. Not much like this out there right now. Kind of Blue Mountain State-esque. Can't wait to see where the next season goes now that some conflict has been introduced.,literal
"Game of Thrones Not to mention the excellent production, perhaps the greatest significance of this play is to show a way to survive for the now declining magic theme movie and TV series.

"not funny didn't laugh Hazbin Hotel has a great animation and I will not deny that fact.

"It looks great...but somehow left me wanting more. Considering how bad the previous Fantasic Four movies have been, this 2025 version can't help but be better. However, it's an improvement and worth seeing...but also a bit disappointing...especially after seeing ""Superman"" just a week before.

The story is visually stunning, has nice costumes and it's obvious Disney spent a lot of money to make the film. However, it also appears as if they thought much less about making the characters believable and multidimensional. There also were a few plot elements which seemed abbreviated...like portions of the movie were edited out and it seemed obvious. Additionally, the film could have used a small infusion of humor. So, after the team manages to save the Earth, you are left thinking 'is that all there is?'. Clearly it's a case of a film that is enjoyable enough to watch but also one with little staying power....meaning you'll probably forget most of the movie after a few weeks. My opinion is that for a non-rabid fan (like me), it's one worth seeing...or not.",literal
Was okay It was okay not great. The songs were kind of dumb and repetitive. Story seemed like it could of been a bit more interesting. Some funny moments and ends on a high note which always helps. Worth the watch but not something I would go back to.,literal
"Much better than I was expecting I must say this film really surprised me. For every good Stephen King adaptation there are two bad ones, and the premise of this film seemed thin enough to land it in the latter category. However, strong performances and solid direction make it a gripping and entertaining ride.

The film centres on a dystopian world where inequality is rife, but the hope of untold riches from completing and winning the long walk provides a glimmer of hope to everyone across the nation. The task is simple, walk at 3mph and don't stop. If you do, you die. Last man standing wins the prize and their life.

A seemingly thin premise, but it shines when examining the characters through tight dialogue and strong performances. Cooper Hoffman and David Jonsson are the two standouts, and provide a lot of heart to the film. You get invested in these young men as they attempt the feat of the long walk, and get to understand the world and the circumstances that led them to entering the contest.

Another strong aspect of this film is the violence, and I don't mean this in a gratuitous way. I think it was important for the message and the essence of these film for us to confront the violence of this world, and the film didn't shy away from it. As the group of walkers is whittled down, each kill is shown in an uncompromising and graphic way, but it feels necessary and poignant.

I also thought the direction from Francis Lawrence was strong. This film could easily have dragged and felt very samey given the premise, but he gave it a good energy and captured the bleak landscape well.

Overall this film was a big surprise for me. The trailer didn't fill me with a huge amount of hope, but it exceeded my expectations to deliver a strong dystopian thriller.",figurative
"I can't put it into words This is one of my most hated movies. It's not some charming Christmas movie. This is cinematic filth, one of the most annoying, vulgar things put to celluloid.

The Griswold family are as unlikeable as the Manson family, and they made me laugh about as much.

Personally, my traditional holiday movie has been A Christmas Story. It's funny, it's cute, it's fun for the whole family to enjoy. It's ten thousand light years ahead of THIS dreck, and it doesn't even try to be so slimy.

If crude obvious sexual humor, dogs humping legs and stereotypes done to hell and back even by the time it was made are your version of funny, this is your movie. Clark, I hope you drown in that pool.",literal
"Money isn't everything? Haha, that's funny I kinda liked it. Not great, not bad either. Funny, warm, easy to watch, easy to forget. The whole ""money isn't everything"" thing doesn't really hold up - the guy literally gets rich and it solves most of his problems. That's the funny part! Which the movie then ruins by going full moral lecture in the end - pure idealistic nonsense. Still, Keanu is adorable here - like a polite robot trying to understand human chaos without breaking anything. Feels pure, awkward in the best way.

Solid 6/10.",figurative
"The title is wrong! These kids weren't monsters!

If you believe those boys as I did then they are not monsters, I too was abused in many ways and I would kill those animals who did it to me if they were still alive.

This drama shows you the travesty and the injustice of the American court system and trial by media (America is famous for this) This series shows you how even to this day that boys/men are never believed when they are abused and how really difficult it is for them to tell other people about what happened to them due to the fact that men are supposed to be men and are not allowed to show their feelings.

The second trial was an absolute disgrace, it was a rigged court, judge and prosecutor. Ok with Lyle trying to impress his new girlfriend by lying that really messed up their chances of a fair hearing, but I reckon you can put that down to his childhood.

Those boys had the worst life imaginable yet America already convicted them second time around.

There are several reasons why I believe their story but one reason really sticks out, look I don't believe in god I do however believe in a higher power and that's what striked down that vile juror who wanted to send those boys to the gas chamber, with her being dead a new juror came in and those boys life's were saved, makes you think doesn't it?",literal
"A Bad Ending woulda been Better than No Ending It's very rare to find so much consensus on IMDB reviews like we have here. The movie begins as a perfect, tense thriller but then quickly devolves. Likes others have said, I was all ready to give this 9 or 10 stars, but then the non-ending occurred, which dropped the score significantly. Also, there were other, laughable gaffes which leave you scratching your head. Baker calls his daughter in Chicago to warn her about the bomb. But he forgets to tell her about the bomb, and instead asks about her dating life. LOL. Just laughable nonsense from Bigelow. Several people kept telling President Idris to retaliate and gave him options of what severity to use...but he never once asked WHO are we gonna bomb. They didn't know who launched the missile, so they need to figure out who to retaliate against before worrying about looking at the weapons menu in the 3-ring binder. A bomb is gonna land in 5 minutes in Chicago. So then why are people in DC evacuating to the forest of Pennsylvania? It's no where near them!!! Lol, come on man. If you refuse to give us an ending, at least have the other parts make sense.",literal
"Forget that it has vampires I left watching Sinners until the fizz died down but I haven't seen a film in a long time that made me so curious, thoughtful and excited.

It's genre-defying and the fact it has vampires in it, for me, didn't come close to making it a 'horror film'.

The vampires are a cleverly used and highly appropriate device but this film is about so much more.

The layers of symbolism, the craft of its slow-burn, its deft character creation, the wonderful script and brilliant rendering by the actors and director are all so much more relevant.

I'm honestly kind of lost for words because I'm still mulling it over but I encourage anyone who still hasn't seen it - if there is anyone - to forget about the vampires and instead lean into all the rest that it offers.

I can wait to see more.",literal

"Outstanding political drama What a surprise! Intelligent dialogs, engaging plot, and the right amount of humor. I really appreciate that a political drama can manage to leave the Republican/Democrat, left/right labels out of the dialog and avoid taking cheap onscreen political shots that won't age well. I dare say, from what I have watched so far, this is on par with the best of The West Wing, without the occasional partisanship or sanctimonious virtue signaling.

The screenplay incorporates current state of world politics in meaningful and timely ways, as a crisis spirals and diplomacy's ""sausage making"" comes into play. Whether it's realistic or not who knows, but it's certainly very entertaining to watch the complexity (and humor) of the interaction between two of the world's greatest allies.

The acting is superb, especially Keri Russell, Rufus Sewell and David Gyasi, but really, everyone all around. The chemistry is outstanding and natural, without the usual early stiffness and awkwardness that gets ironed out over a few episodes.

The only nit is that I wish they wouldn't use profanity so much. There are places in the script where it's called for to great effect, but much of the time it's just too casual.

Unfortunately, there is another lesser show with the same title that was released just weeks prior that could lead to some confusion. It's coincidental, but hopefully, no one is missing out on this gem as a result.",figurative
"Poor representation of Polonesian culture I was born in Maui, lived there for 13 years and my sister is named Moana. Growing up I heard many legends about the Hawaiian hero Maui, many many legends and ANY of them would have made a better plot for this film.

This is an example of an actual legend that has been Disneypulated into a pile of cliché plot twists in a tale that is nothing like any Hawaiian legend you have ever heard. 

The music is awful and more African than Polonesian. Auli'i Cravalho is the only singer with talent, and unfortunately for her the songwriter was super lame. Lame lame lame lame. I can't say lame enough when it comes to the music. They did not try.

The antagonist was horribly underdeveloped. They just gave up I guess.

Jemaine Clement's cameo was a disappointment, the best actor given the smallest role and a lame song to boot. Love him in Flight of the Concords, hate him in this movie.

Worst of all was the use of the encouraging phrase, ""OK now go save the world!"" as if the writers are making fun of how cliché their own plot is.

Lastly we come to Maui himself. It's obvious the references used for the character were not the images from actual Hawaiian legends. No, instead the reference was Bruddah Iz! Yes, the immensely obese and recently deceased Ukelele player. Sure, why not?! I can't say I have ever respected Dwayne the Rock as an actor either, Vin Diesel would have been way better.

I conclude that this movie sucks Pele's cha cha.",literal
"ALL TIME BEST SERIES I have watched this series many times. I still get excited and look forward to next episode. The acting, writing, characters, sound tracks, directing and production are brilliant. I wouldn't change a thing. There are characters we love or hate and all emotions will be felt in this series. Casting is brilliant.

This is a mob story so yes there is violence, inappropriate and insensitive themes that are realistic to who the cast are portraying. Not sure why some reviews were expecting in a mafia themed series.

This has been my favourite series from the day it was released. Tony Soprano is an amazing complex character.

If you love the mob, family and organised crime this is a must watch. If not....choose something that you do.",literal
"Valiant effort at something different I have to give it up to Scott Derrickson. To create a sequel that is even more ambitious than his already ambitious first outing is impressive. Now, some of those ambitions pay off and other not so much, I applaud him regardless.

I'll start with some of the negatives. The acting felt all over the place. Most performances were good, but there were completely unconvincing moments as well. That could be attributed to some of the cheesy dialog though. I get that it took place in the 80's and that these are teenagers, but some of the lines just downright feel unnatural.

The signature direction Derrickson takes with his films also looms over this film. It's the same in Sinister, his VHS short, and even the first Black Phone film. It's getting a bit old now, and I'd like to see him go for something wholly different on his next outing.

I did enjoy the Freddy Krueger-esque Grabber this time around. It threw an interesting twist into the paranormal murder investigation. And Ethan Hawke plays a pretty good villian. Derrickson was also smart to end the film the way he did. A nice wrap up without a crappy hollywood stinger attempt to set up a sequel.

Overall, I really liked the story. I cared and was invested in the characters because of the first film, which is more than what you can ask from a sequel these days. Some of the plot devices were a little too convenient, and the acting a little weak at times, but to make up for those moments we got a fantastic Ethan Hawke as a truly horrifying presence. I recommend it on his performance alone.

"Cold Christmas A friend of mine called Willie swears this is one of the best, if not THE best Christmas movie ever and gave me his treasured DVD from off his shelf so that I too could share in the fun. However, given that his musical taste runs only as far as Shaking' Stevens and Five Star (in other words naff 80's music), I wasn't hopeful sitting down to watch it on a cold, snowy-outside pre-Christmas night (i.e. everything in its favour!).

Having said that, my wife, who loves TV shows like ""You've Been Framed"" featuring the public falling down a lot, laughed quite a lot, but that too is no recommendation. I appreciate that it probably struck and continues to strike a chord with the American public, where massive family re-unions on Christmas Day with the house done up like the Blackpool or Vegas Illuminations are de rigeur (although the latter practice is certainly growing in the UK), but for me, who's never really latched onto the National Lampoon type of humour, I was left colder than a penguin.

Chevy Chase does his best with his portrayal of Everyman USA, hoping for his big Christmas bonus from his employer, fantasising about younger women and trying to please everyone in the family, even the black sheep (although in this family, some are blacker than others!) but despite many pratfalls, explosions and embarrassing moments, my funny bone resolutely refused to be tickled.

Not much more to say really, other than I'll be watching ""White Christmas"" and ""It's A Wonderful Life"" over the next two days, where I know I will be transported into the world of Christmas, but this particular damp squib, I'll leave to the very young, very American and Willie.",literal
"Not exactly a stroll in the park. Once you've started The Long Walk, there's no stopping or turning back, no matter how brutal or uncomfortable it gets - the film leaves no option but to dig deep, push on, find the resolve, just to see who makes it to the end and who gets their brains plastered all over the tarmac.

This latest film from the mind of Stephen King is a gruelling trek that leaves the viewer drained and emotionally exhausted, as 50 young men in dystopian post-war America take part in an annual contest, a forced march with a large cash prize for whoever lasts the longest; however, those who fail to keep up the pace of 3mph are executed at gunpoint, the whole event televised nationwide.

Before I saw The Long Walk, I wondered how a film could make over 100 minutes of walking entertaining, but I shouldn't have worried: the film succeeds in being thoroughly engrossing throughout thanks to assured direction from Francis Lawrence, an engaging script, short, sharp jolts of graphic violence, and excellent performances from all involved, with Cooper Hoffman and David Jonsson leading the pack as new friends Ray and Peter, and none other than Mark Hamill as the ruthless major who oversees the walk.

My rating for The Long Walk is 8.5/10, rounded up to 9 for the unforgettable explosive diarrhoea scene.",literal
"The closer you think you are, the less you'll actually see. Now You See Me is directed by Louis Leterrier and collectively written by Ed Solomon, Boaz Yakin and Edward Ricourt. It stars Jesse Eisenberg, Mark Ruffalo, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher, Dave Franco, Mélanie Laurent, Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine and Michael Kelly. Music is by Brian Tyler and cinematography by Mitchell Amundsen and Larry Fong.

An F.B.I. Agent and an Interpol Detective are tracking a team of illusionists who appear to be pulling off bank heists during their performances. Real magic? Or elaborate criminology?.

We are in the realm of the fantastical, where illusions and impossible tricks reside. It's a nifty backdrop to this splendidly flashy slice of misdirection hokum. Our four magicians, each with their own personal skills - and calling themselves ""The Four Horsemen"" - enact a number of elaborate stage shows that has all members of the law baffled.

Their rich benefactor played by Caine, is smug about his charges, Freeman is the myth buster trying to unearth the secrets of the ""four"", while the cops are constantly pulling their hair out. What does it all mean? How will it pan out at the end?. Well it's great fun, the tricks are expertly staged, the cast give gravitas to their respective characters, if only the big reveal at the end wasn't a bit too far out there...

There's a bit of a steal and a nod to another heist caper film, while that finale can make or break your overall opinion of the piece. Yet the journey is so enjoyable and intriguing, it's kind of forgivable anyway... 8/10",figurative
"Outstanding cast chemistry! Tracker is a fun, engaging, adventurous show with amazing cast chemistry. I love seeing Justin Hartley and Jensen Ackles on screen together. It's absolutely believable that they are brothers, and playoff off of each other so well.

The buildup and mystery to what happened with their father is exciting, I can't wait to find out more about that storyline.

Overall, I think the show is well written and has several engaging storylines. I'm a huge fan of action adventure shows, so I love seeing the well choreographed fight scenes in Tracker.

They hint at a possible relationship forming between either Russell Shaw and Reenie, or Coulter and Reenie. I'm curious to see how that plays out.

"Seminal TV, potentially a ground-breaking classic Severance is a study of the philosophy and ethics of self. A dry lecture? Nothing could be further from the truth, this is a tightly-written, entertaining work of TV with these weighty concepts shown through story with little or no jarring exposition dumps.

Visual cues such as the 'innie' 60's monotone dress code and the bland featureless white environment together with the monotonous meaningless work deny hope and support conformity. Garish reward events apply Pavlov conditioning, the punishments and close supervision create an environment of fear and uncertainty providing easy control.

The gradual awakening of the 'inmates' and the ensuing disobedience, rebellion and subsequent violence is the core of this very human story. All this in a backdrop of consequential slow-reveal of an ever more complex situation and underlying uncertainty regarding the goals and motivation of the de facto prison guards.

Addendum: Just watched the season one finale - it is simply superb, a fitting end to a fine series and creating massive potential for season 2. Just upgraded from 9* to 10* - very rare for me!",literal
"Stunning masterpiece LFF#6 What a stunning cinematic masterpiece.

Joachim Trier is more than a director, he's a photographer of the soul. He effortlessly captures doubt, regret, and frustration on a moving face. This is a complex family drama that questions where we place sentimental value: in a home, friends, siblings, our past, or our present? How can art pave the way for forgiveness?

By creating a paradoxical and intimate world where the cast perfectly mirrors the character's backgrounds, Trier immerses us in a Freudian exploration of acting-both on a stage and in life.

The New Order song ""World"" appears briefly in a needle drop. We hear only a few notes in the film however the chorus resonates: ""That's the price of love, can you feel it?""

Joachim Trier has made an absolute timeless classic.",figurative

"Watchable, not the best sports show on TV It's hard to watch this show and compare it to recent hits like Ted Lasso or even Stick, which does this kind of semi-progressive over-the-hill comeback story better.

Glenn Powell stars as a has-been quarterback who gets cancelled after pushing over wheelchair-bound kid in the wake of a game-losing fumble.

Powell's character, Russ Holliday, comes up with a scheme that seems highly implausible, even by the standards of someone who knows little to nothing about football (AKA me): Eight years later, throw on some prosthetic, adopt the name Chad Powers, and try out for a college team that he doesn't even attend classes at. The fact that the last part gets swept under the rug is a commentary on the tendency of big college programs to look the other way, it's still pretty weak.

With the assistance of the school mascot (Frankie Rodriguez) (who happens to be gay, so there's an attempt at diversity points here), Chad is able to make it through the tryouts.

The show tries to incorporate a number of elements -- a slow burn romance between Chad and the coach's assistant (Perry Mattfield); a classic sports story; a classic redemption story; a comedy of errors; a B-plot involving a father (Steve Zahn) learning to trust his daughter; an odd couple heart-filled relationship between Chad and the mascot -- but it hardly develops any of these threads.

Besides his relationship with the mascot, almost none of his other teammates is anything beyond an extra. As a result, a lot of team-centered stories are neglected. The romance angle is an incredibly slow burn, which adds a level of realism, but it's not enough to hold audience attention through the first half of the season

With Chad's relationship with the mascot character, the climate of the team is so difficult to gauge, that there's not even enough of a baseline to examine if their partnership/friendship is supposed to be seen as uplifting in a homophobic locker room, or passe in an era where there are already out players in the NFL.

There's also some level of generational trauma between Russ/Chad and his dad, but that doesn't get enough screentime to get us invested in that.

At the same time, things start clicking enough by the fourth episode that there's reason (at least for this viewer) to keep watching. Lots of shows have had poor starts and there's enough room to grow if some of these elements get more densely developed.",literal
"Worst One Yet Even Scarlett Johanssen couldn't save this one.

This franchise needs fresh creativity. All the old tropes are there; the villains are familiar, the use of children is the same as the first one, corporate greed is represented and the dinosaurs are so inept at hunting you wonder how they survived as long as they did.

There was not one interesting character, thought Scarlett came close. No one changes or grows. Everything is predictable and safe.

The dinosaurs are the best part of the movie, but they are neither scary nor believable. The best dino moments were when they were just being wild creatures; nothing they did to advance the weak plot.

They've milked this cow dry. We need another Dr. Michael Crichton to create a world and characters that make us astonished and afraid again. I don't want another movie with ""Jurassic"" in the title.",figurative

They make his Christmas the best one so far, and he makes the Christmas their best ever. By watching this with my grandfather, it really brought out the Christmas spirit in me. It really, truly did.

15 years Great show for 15 years after that it went downhill. It started when Michael Weatherly left and went from there. From about the 2019 season onward it left its primary theme of military based crime investigation and started become a melodrama of horrible episodes about things like prison reform and side stories that had next to nothing to do with the military. Once this started happening the show lost all respect and became unwatchable.,literal

I have not missed episode of Law & Order since it started. Was indeed one of the longest running, truly dramatic programs with a top shelf cast, no matter who came and went. The quality of the show always remained intact and was terrific. Year after year after year...

"Moral Compass or Not? My enormous respect for the work of Taylor Sheridan took a nosedive in episode 3 when he put words in the mouth of Billy Bob Thornton's character, extolling the virtues of the fossil fuel, oil! To his credit, he did give the counter argument via the young female lawyer saying,""it will be the death of us all"" (or words to that effect).

Maybe episode 3 is too early to judge. I should expect the unexpected from Sheridan as he may find his moral compass by the last episode. It's happened before; he's a thoughtful film maker with an ethical take. I love everything he's produced so far and he shows good sense with his casting. Very good sense with BBT!",literal
"Finally A Show About Us This show is brilliantly written, has a fantastic cast, keeps you laughing from start to finish of every episode, and shows that even particle physics can be funny. For some of you who may not have seen The Big Bang Factor yet it is a lot like Scrubs if you crank up the geek factor and move the characters from a hospital to a laboratory.

I'm not sure what CBS is doing to promote this series but clearly it is not enough. I heard about this show through a friend and I have never seen a commercial for it ever. I don't know if CBS is trying to keep this show a secret or if their marketing guys just fell asleep at the wheel but this show is fantastic.

The characters, that seem exaggerated at first, are actually believable if you have ever been to a physics conference of any kindor for that matter any comic-con. These ""geeks"" make up an ever growing segment of our population and I think it is wonderful that they finally have a show to call their own. Perhaps I am biased because of my own nerd tendencies but I have had arguments exactly like the ones in this show with my own clique of nerdy friends.

"Funny, but not as funny This was fun to watch, but nowhere near as fun as the original. Chevy Chase played his part perfectly as always. And the other characters were funny too. The nasty father in law, the crazy, senile aunt, the cigar smoking uncle with the wig, the hillbilly relative Eddie, etc. The touching moments necessary for a good comedy (like comic relief in a tragedy) are well woven in. I almost cried when Clark was stuck in the attic and looking at old movies of when he was a child with his mother there. Of course that whole scene was funny with the boards that we plopping up, hitting him in the head. And the yuppie neighbours were hilarious. Nice touch.

However, I just cannot get into this as much as the old one. It is not something I wold watch again I don't think. I might...but not like I would watch the original. The story line did not flow as well. I think it did in the old one because they had somewhere they were going. Here they did not have that, and they did not have any sense of counting down until Christmas Day. Well, funny, but not as funny, and not as well written out.",literal
"Undeniably charming Two losers are consistently humiliated at school and don't have a love life to speak of. They conjure up a vivacious woman from their computer that they made up in their heads (Kelly LeBrock) This woman gives the boys a new sense of entitlement and confidence, leading to messy and hysterical results. I have a weakness for cheesy films from the 80's. If it is cheesy, well done, there is a good chance I am gonna be entertained. I wouldn't consider Weird Science to be one of John Hughes best films, far from it actually, but it is enjoyable and that's all I care about. The premise doesn't make much sense and lacks the believability factor, but that's OK with me. I kicked my brain to the curb and was able to go with it. John Hughes knows how to entertain his audience and go with the times. This may not be the strongest of scripts, but he injects some great humor into this movie. I laughed my ass off on quite a few occasions. Anthony Michael-Hall is a member of the infamous brat-pack. He has charm in spades in this movie. Ilan Mitchell-Smith is solid as Hall's geeky friend. Bill Paxton is a scene stealer as Mitchell-Smith's mean brother. And, of course, Kelly LeBrock is very memorable as the creation. She was downright breathtaking at this juncture, what happened?! 

Final Thoughts: Please kick your brain to the curb, this isn't Schindler's list. There is no reason you can't enjoy this film for what it is. Go back into the 80's and have some fun!

"10 STARS 🌟 I can't believe that this only has a rating of 6.9. This is a 10-star show all day long. It's a masterpiece. This is the best show I've seen in a long time hands down. FX just does it right man. Everything they touch turns to gold. Look at Rotten Tomatoes. 97%! The reason for this low rating on IMDB is because you have morons leaving reviews and rating shows. Anyway if you haven't had a chance to check this one out, I highly suggest this show. Ethan Hawke is absolutely brilliant in this. I never was a huge Ethan Hawke fan, but after this I am!",figurative
"Amazing conclusion This was an amazing conclusion to an amazing story. Both Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande delivered A+ performances in this movie, with Erivo's rendition of No Good Deed getting a standing ovation. I'm curious to see if they adapt the other books in this series into movies, as this cast and crew makes this adaptation. I still wish the director had cast someone other than Jeff Goldblum as The Wizard (it once again felt like he was playing a caricature of himself rather than a con man/snake oil salesman), Spoilers below

I also wish we saw either Boq or Glinda returning Dr Dillamond's glasses to him upon his return to the classroom, and had poppy flowers behind them, showing how much they'd learned but also having the story come full circle. Why is there no credit for Dorothy?",literal
"Without Hotch, the show suffers Hotchner is the legal mind, and the one to keep everything together. The show now suffers without him. ""Wheels up in 30,"" just doesn't sound the same coming from others. Don't get me wrong, I like the other characters, but Hotch was the glue. Egos need to let it go and do what is right not what you can do to throw the playground tantrum to get what you want. No respect for people with money using that as a means of getting their way...childish!!! Hotch started on this show and his character was the most interesting. He needs to be back on the show or I feel the show is going to reach a slow demise.",literal
"A bit of a discriminating views of ""old south"" The fourth episode put me on the fence as Sheridan portrays the relationship between Landman and his wife and daughter, it's pretty obvious the camera man loves the butt of the daughter because he seems to take pictures of her butt more than her face. The mother portrayed by Ali Larter is trashy and really bad acting. While I realize Sheridan's Lioness portrays strong sexy women they's something about an ex pushing herself the limit of vulgarity, not sexuality, since reportedly she's remarried. Billy Bob and all the other men are casts well. Demi playing the trophy wife has more class that the mother daughter idiot duel. The storylines seem good and the son is doing a great job as an unknown actor.

Now that I'm at 12/15 episode, I'm invested because of the realism of the oil industry and have watched the son's arc - Sheridan needs to drop the wife and daughter - their just a bad example of ""dramatic"" wives of Texas series (yes, Andy Cohens lucrative series). Gawd she a bad ... the daughter even worst (stick to no talking and just butt shots) but it adds to the sexiness of the show. Billy Bob is his deadpan image cracks me up with how he deals with them both and he DESERVES an Emmy for showing such restraint.

The storyline with the son is saddening as I'm sure it's real ... and that violence found in the drug world. I can't give it a 10 only because the casting is off and storyline burps out of sync.",literal
"The most addicting and best show on television! Words cannot describe the amazing Plot of the show! It is so addicting, you just can't stop watching it! I don't have a favorite character because the entire cast is amazing! I was heartbroken when Detective Stabler left, but it was going to happen anyway. The characters are so attached to each other, they all share an unbreakable bond. They care for each other so much, that it sometimes gets in the way of their work. That, unfortunately is the reason detective Stabler left. Both he and Olivia cared for each other so much that when the man held a gun to Stabler's head, Olivia didn't to risk killing Stabler. They have gotten to know each other for so long, that it is heartbreaking to see them leave. I hope B.D. Wong will be coming back. He was an amazingly skilled, and well played character. Law and Order: Special Victims Unit not only is they best Law and Order ever made, it is the best show ever made! I can't wait for season 15!",literal
"A great show in the making I saw the two hour premiere on TNT I personally believe this could be one of the great shows in the making. I loved all the characters they're very rich the fact that the story is based around this seventeen year old kid is pretty cool as well. The kid has a hard life to start out with then gets thrust into this whole other world that's beyond his capacity level. Through tough circumstances he is reintroduced to his grandmother and uncles that are on the other side of the law and to see if he'll stay on the right side of the law or be corrupted and follow in his family's footsteps is very intriguing. Ellen Barkin won me over in the first episode when she told ""Baz"" Scott Speedman's character to stop being a wussy by playing both sides and start leading. And she told Craig her other son to clean the dog stuff up from her driveway as she walked off. All I can say is Smurf rules. I love Shawn Hatosy and Scott Speedman they are excellent actors and it's cool that they found something that's really edgy. Daniella Alonso and Molly Gordon are a very nice touch they are very talented actresses and pleasing to the eye. All in all I suggest this show to all it had a strong showing and it'll be great to see if they can keep it up hopefully for a very long,long time to come.",literal
"Motion sickness Tried to watch this with my daughter but couldn't get more than five minutes in before feeling sick. Seems the frame rate is deliberately dropped to 12fps which is awful. It felt like playing VR, just headache and sickness.

Look, I get the need for style but this is ridiculous. Never have I felt sick watching tv or a cartoon.",literal
"A Movie Sequal with 0 Plot So it was for MMM at regal, but the issue is that it's a sequel. I haven't seen Sisu 1 and have been motivated to just not after watching. It is comedic when it forces it-self to be, it is very action pack with it being stupidly unrealistic (which is fine, just stuff not for me), and it was creative. The only feelings I have for the movie is just ""slop."" The action felt corny overall, and I think there could be more put into it.

The biggest issue i have is the base of every movie, which is plot and story.

Genuinely, I hugely, just need and wished there was a ""story"" or some plot motivator for this movie, because without it, it was just action for the hell of it. I personally don't mind action sequences or movies, but most of them still have plot or a story to back them up. John Wick, first 30 minutes is the movie setting up his life with his small family. Nobody 1/2, much longer time making it feel understandable that this is a character similar to us with emotions.

We leave act 1 first in the five minutes. All i got is that he was a POW, part of war, and had a family. That is nice on paper but in reality it felt like throwaway pieces of knowledge.

I watched a sequel to a movie the same day and I still understood that if you didn't see the other movies, you can 100% watch this movie lacking a bit of context that isn't exactly required. This should've had enough previous context to get more out of it than just his house. Understandable if it's a short film but this is featured length. Bits and pieces could've 100% been dropped in throughout the movie.

The only spoiler I got is the last scene. While I was watching it, me and my friend were so disappointed and fed up with the whole movie that when he gets to the missile part, I just told my friend, ""They're gonna act like that's a nuke with a giant mushroom cloud and all."" He's said nah because he think this movie was pretty realistic. It was a mushroom cloud and it didn't even feel satisfying.

The only points to give here is the action sequences, cinematography, dressing, etc. Just everything that isn't the screenplay.",literal
"Silly and flat 80's sci-fi action movie but still holds a charm The Running Man is very silly. They use silly sound effects, the helicopter has a jet sound effect, the M-16s have hand gun sound effects, and there were a couple more examples I laughed about but can't remember now. The plot is a ridiculous but irresistible near future dystopian society that uses gladiator games to quell the masses and take their minds from their empty bellies. I've no doubt this movie would have been long forgotten if not for some very charismatic and memorable performances by Arnold Schwarzenegger and Richard Dawson. Jesse Ventura also appears with what looks to be a very bad toupee but isn't given much to do. My biggest pet peeve with this movie is the poor editing, we jump from scene to scene at times too abruptly. It isn't as if you'll have trouble following the story, but five minutes edited back in would have given the movie much better flow. Still this is an action movie and Arnold delivers while also delivering his trademark one liners.",literal
Great Grinch This was by far the best and most successful adaptation of the story of The Grinch. It not only captures the story of The Grinch and the spirit of Christmas but it also adds a creative and original spin. Jim Carrey is absolutely masterful and hilarious in this and able to make The Grinch truly come to life. It was also very cool to see this movie successfully turned into real life characters versus cartoons. Everything about this movie is just a great success and this is hands down one of the best Christmas movies. It's worth watching every year leading up to the holidays to get you into the spirit.,literal
"A must watch this Academy Award season An all-around excellently crafted film from start to finish featuring powerful acting performances (shout out to Paul Mescal, and especially Jessie Buckley, whose performance knocked my socks off), extremely thoughtful writing, breathtaking cinematography, luscious scenery, great set pieces, and a compelling score that keeps you emotionally invested in the stakes behind everything. All the while exploring grief in a nuanced, tear inducing way. It lived up to the hype and it was well deserving of the coveted ""People's Choice Award"" at this year's festival.",literal
the best I've played only the games and the show completely catch me and my excitement. The characters and geralt in specific is so amazing henry cavill played it so well that i dont imagine anyone else playing it besides him.,literal
"Don't bother It's like they thought 'if we add all these great actresses no one will notice the wooden doll attempting to be an actor'. Kim stick to scripted reality show crap. You're not an actress.

The premise of show seemed great & it actually has some great actresses in it. But having that talentless Kardashian. Nope. One episode & im done.

Just a waste of time.",literal
"Nothing is happening If you're looking to waste some time, this is the perfect movie for you.

It starts with: ""Oh no, a missile is coming!"" Then people start panicking, running everywhere, trying to fight the missile... and of course, missing it. Then they miss it again.

Next scene - more people trying to deal with the same problem. Talking, talking, and more talking: ""I love you."" ""Run away!"" ""Where are you?"" ""Hello!"" Blah blah blah...

And that's basically the whole movie. Nothing really happens until the end - people are still running, realizing they couldn't do anything about the missile.

By that point, I was fighting sleep more than they were fighting the missile.",figurative
"Wanting to be a D'ellacourt at all costs... 1969 was a period of great unrest in the US, with the unpopular Vietnam war, student protests on the streets, and the women's movement on the rise. All this under the presidency of the conservative, Tricky Dicky (Richard Nixon). But that didn't mean a thing to Maxine Simmons, who at the time was so determined to infiltrate Palm Beach high society at any cost, while the world was crumbling around her.

The viewer will squirm and cringe with great amusement as Maxine digs herself so deep into a mess, and then attempts to climb out of that bottomless hole by any means necessary in this farcical series that takes a swipe at the lives of deluded filthy rich housewives of Palm Beach. To help it along, it is the performances of Kristen Wiig and the dynamic supporting cast that make this a pure delight!

Overall it is taking too long to tell a simple tale that feels a little drawn out, even after three episodes. Maybe best suited as a feature length, but it is still enticing enough to see how far Maxine will go to conquer the upper-class social scene, and hopefully make a mess of it all.",literal
I will never see public bathroom sinks in the same light ever again. I've been a Channing Tatum fanboy since the Jump Street series. There's something about his dry humor and smooth delivery that draws me in. This movie is both funny and heartbreaking with a slight edge given to the comedy side of it. Kiersten Dunst and Peter Dinklage have great roles also. What's great about this movie is that it's based on real life with probably some movie magic thrown into the mix for entertainment value. I would not be shocked to see Tatum and/or Dunst to get nominations for this one. This movie is one of my favorites I've seen so far this year. What's great is the chemistry everybody in the cast has with each other. There were several laugh out loud scenes. Tatum's character is both clever and dumb and that combination truly makes this film one to not miss.,figurative
"It's the greatest show ever aired pure and simple I've rewatched it so many times since the final episode aired. It's cemented in time as a pillar to worship in honor of the golden age of television. It wiped award shows. It murdered its competition. It is as unbelievably well done now as it was 20 years ago.

Sure there are other great shows, The Wire, Oz, The Shield, Breaking Bad, Justified, etc. But however close some of them may have got none of them every surpassed what The Sopronas was and is.

Breaking Bad got really really close but despite how excellent Bryan Cranston was he still couldn't surpass the transcendent performance that James Gandolfini graces us with. He IS Tony Soprano. He embodied the words Davis Chase put on paper and brought them to life as a real character, with real problems, who happens to be in the mob.

The story is tight and interesting but the casting and acting is what makes this the greatest show ever to air. It's unlikely even as television progresses there will ever be a show that can outclass The Sopranos.

If you haven't watched it, watch it now. If you have already watched it, what number rewatch are you on now ?",figurative
"Best Show still on Television N.C.I.S (Naval Criminal Investigative Service) is a crime procedural set in Washington D.C. that follows a team of special agents who solve crimes involving naval officers and marines. The show was created by Donald P. Bellisario, who also produced JAG and Magnum P.I., as a spin off of JAG in 2003. It airs Tuesday nights at 8pm. The show creates great stories through a very likable, yet diverse cast in character driven plots with a perfect mix of drama and comedy. 

The show centers on the NCIS Major Case Response Team of Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs (Mark Harmon), Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo (Michael Weatherly), Special Agent Tim McGee (Sean Murray), Caitlin Todd (Sasha Alexander), Ziva David (Cote De Pablo), Dr. Donald ""Ducky"" Mallard (David McCallum), and Abby Sciuto (Pauley Perrette). 

Leroy Jethro Gibbs is an ex-marine sniper who is the leader of the team. He is very dedicated to his job and also very good at what he does. He lives by a set of rules that are often quoted in episodes such as rule #7 ""Always be specific when you lie."" He does have many character flaws, however, such as his obsession over certain terrorists or his three ex- wives. Gibbs consumes large amounts of coffee and in his spare time he builds a boat. 

Anthony DiNozzo is an ex-Baltimore homicide detective and the team's senior special agent behind Gibbs. Despite his flaws of being a relatively unsuccessful womanizer, he gets the job done in the end. DiNozzo loves movies and can relate almost any case to a movie he has seen.

Tim McGee is a computer specialist who graduated from MIT. He was a recurring character during the shows first season but became a full time agent at the beginning of the second season. McGee is very good with computers but is socially awkward at times. 

Caitlin Todd is an ex-secret service agent who joined the team at the end of the first episode in the first season. She is a very good profiler and disgusted by DiNozzo's womanizing behavior which is used for humor. Agent Todd is only on the show for the first two seasons.

Ziva David is a Mossad Liason Officer and she becomes a full time agent in the seventh season. She comes in at the beginning of the third season to stop Gibbs from killing her half-brother Ari Haswari who killed Caitlin Todd but ends up being the one to kill Ari. 

Ducky is the NCIS Medical Examiner. He has traveled the world doing autopsies and has seen just about everything. In almost every situation he has a story but usually gets cut off by Gibbs or whoever is asking him what he found.

Abby Sciuto is the forensic specialist. She is goth, listens to heavy metal, sleeps in a coffin, and practically mainlines caffeine. 

One main thing that makes the show great is the actors and how convincing they are in their respective roles. For example, David McCallum, who plays Ducky, has studied anatomy since taking the role and actually knows what he is talking about, unlike most actors. Pauley Perrette (Abby) has been interested in forensics her whole life and studied criminology at Valdosta State. 

In comparison to similar crime drama shows such as the CSI franchise, NCIS knocks it out of the park. The characters in NCIS are more relatable to real life than those in CSI mainly because they have many the same flaws and characteristics as common Americans. Also, NCIS has more comedy than most crime drama's with the possible exception of Human Target, which was canceled after two seasons anyway. 

NCIS just finished its eighth season and became the highest rated scripted show on television in its seventh season, which is very unusual for a show to do that, showing that the best is still to come. It ranked fifth in all shows (including sports and reality shows) the last three years, and the ratings prove that it's not just me who loves the show but a majority of the people who watch TV on a Tuesday night. It is a phenomenal show and I would recommend it to anyone regardless of preference to comedy or drama because it has such a great mix of both.",figurative
"Great S2 So far Season 1 is good, But season 2 is better. Hopefully there will be a season 3 Stana Katic is a great actress!!",literal
"Fun and Entertaining Seeing the promo over and over again made me skeptical of the premise and quality of the show; however, it played after Doctor Odyssey and all of a sudden we were watching it, then we watched the next episode. It's fun and entertaining, easy to watch. Kaitlin Olsen does a great job with the role and makes the character likable, quirky, and interesting; Daniel Sunjata and the rest of the cast are excellent. Is it plausible that the police would bring in someone not in law enforcement that also cleans the building to help them solve a murder, especially after they tampered with their white board, even if they're extremely capable? No, probably not. If I want to watch a show for accuracy, I'll watch a documentary. This show is fun, interesting, and easy to watch, I like the escape.",literal
"special A special serie from each angle, from performances to lovely story, from costumes to landscapes, from the great mix of drama and romance to the realistic portrait of a world. The old fashion flavour, horses, tension, choices, pain, love. And something enveiling the entire story in the mist of a special serie , charming, precise in each detail and high honest with its public.",literal
"Fun and lighthearted Alan Ritchson has become one of my favor actors, and I have always loved Kevin James. Their personalities complimented one another so well in this, and while, yes, it had its moments of shaky camera, etc.. that didn't remove any stars for me.

It was lighthearted and funny. My husband and I really enjoyed the movie and the laughs it brought us. We will surely watch it again!

Let's not critique so hard on a movie that was meant to be silly, funny, and whacky because it definitely met those standards.",literal
"Thoroughly gripping - bit confusing at points I have played the games and read the books. I must say that the first season has stuck to the books really well. I watched the whole of season 1 in a single session and enjoyed every moment of it. HOWEVER, a few things that annoyed me:

1. Casting - i think that they could have casted Yennefer differently. Especially from playing the games Yen has been portrayed as a white skinned womanly character. However in the series she is quite ""girly"" which didnt quite sit right. The same could be said for the casting of Triss. 2. I feel like the 1st season jumps around in time a lot. It took me quite a while to realise that different parts were based in completely different times. It only really came together close to the end of the 1st season.

Taking all this into account however, i am really looking forward to the 2nd season and how closely they can keep to the books. I would also like to see them start to introduce the Wild Hunt in future seasons, similarly to the 3rd game. (Despite the fact that they didnt have THAT much of a significance in the books)",literal
"It Was Good! I had no interest in seeing this movie. But given the positive reception surrounding this movie, I decided to give it a good ole college try. I was impressed to say the least.

The main highpoint of the movie is the exploration of sisterhood between both Elphaba and Glinda, and how one went down the path of good, and vice versa.

This was Cynthia Erivo's movie, and I thought she did an admirable job playing Elphaba. She had so many interesting character moments that happened in this film that made her transformation at the end seem believable.

But...y'all...Ariana Grande was PHENOMENAL! She brought so much life to her character Glinda. Her Comedic Timing, and her Acting were both Amazing! I think after watching this, I'd like to see her act in something else. She get's two Big Thumbs Up from Me! :)

I think for me personally, there weren't alot of songs that stuck out to me. The exception for me would be the song Popular. (saying this after I gushed about Ariana Grande. Hehe) I thought the choreography was on point, and the costume design's were very vibrant.

The only thing that could've been better is that the runtime could've been shorter. I think there are certain scenes that could've been cut by at least 20 minutes, but that's just my personal preference.

From a guy who's not big into musicals, this was impressive. I think the story overall was believable, and entertaining. I will revisit this again before Part II coming in 2025.

Solid B.",literal
"Toni Collette is creepy I've heard all you can hear about the troubled teen industry. The late night kidnappings and abuse...even deaths are disturbing. The fact that lazy parents paid for this is insane. This show definitely captures that smothering atmosphere. Only 2 episodes in and it's great so far. The bad reviews on here from people who act like they know what they're talking about is laughable. They think it's coming off the success of a documentary is humorous.

Toni Collette's performance is amazing and eerie. She captures the essence of a cult like leader. Mae Martin definitely did a good job of writing this and acting in it.

If you have an interest in cults or cult like industries, then you should check this out.",literal
"even for someone not interested in sports ""The Sandlot"" may just look like it's about baseball, but moreover, it's about friendship, with some nostalgia thrown in. Set in 1962, Scotty Smalls moves into a new neighborhood. Uncertain of the area at first, he becomes friends with some boys in a baseball field known as the Sandlot. Over the summer, they try to get girls, battle a rival team, and do a few things that they shouldn't have. All the while, they have to remember about a dog known as ""The Beast"".

As someone who has never been interested in sports, I seemingly wouldn't take any stock in this movie. But I did. I admit that Karen Allen, as Scotty's mom, and Denis Leary, as her boyfriend, are the only cast members whom I recognize, but it's a really interesting movie.",figurative
"Overly dramatic Watching this series evokes a peculiar sensation, akin to observing a dramatized medical procedure, albeit one produced with the expansive, cost-effective ethos of a bulk retailer like Coso.

The narrative simply said, presents a composite figure, a pastiche of the diagnostic acumen of M. D. House and the deductive prowess of numerous iterations of Sherlock Holmes (the modern and old ones). The plot however, unfolds with such predictable regularity that it elicits a sense of acute discomfort, a feeling bordering on social awkwardness, aka cringeworthy!

Furthermore, the supporting characters, numbering excessively and engaging in superfluous exchanges, contribute to an atmosphere laden with overly dramatic tension. These secondary mostly unneeded actors, in moments of purported intellectual revelation, articulate their reactions with phrases such as, ""OMG I think my brain had just an orgasm,"" which serves to alienate the viewer and treats them like stupids, inducing a profound sense of detachment to the moment.

This incongruity compels a cessation of the viewing experience, a deliberate act of disengagement, and a subsequent transition to alternative forms of entertainment, a decision we, in fact, implemented. The sheer volume of banal interaction and the over-reliance on overly dramatic side narratives, dilutes what could have been a compelling experience into a repetitive and ultimately, unfulfilling one. The inherent lack of subtlety, and the reliance on overly familiar tropes, creates a sense of weariness, rather than engagement, and a feeling of being subjected to a poorly executed imitation of superior works.",literal
"One of best show of the year Hands down ! Superb 'Last Man Standing' derivative. The action sequences are better than those from the multi-million dollar Marvel and DC franchises and the atmosphere and historicism of the show is first-class. If you thought the recent remake of 'Shogun' was good and a lot of people compared these two together then you will love this, it's definitely on the same bar with shogun.",literal
"Yorgos Lanthimos' best movie Yorgos Lanthimos is one of those new filmmakers who I have a lot of respect for as a master of the art form, but his two movies that I've watched so far haven't done that for me and I thought that was going to be the case with Bugonia (2025). Luckily for me, this movie was absolutely phenomenal and is my favorite movie from Yorgos Lanthimos.

Positives for Bugonia (2025): First off, this is the Yorgos movie with the most interesting plot I've seen where you have two young men who kidnap a powerful CEO as they suspect that she is secretly an alien who wants to destroy Earth. The movie does an excellent job at taking the premise and uses it as an excellent mechanism for exploring trauma in these two young men and what they've gone through their lives. The acting from the cast particularly from Emma Stone, Aidan Delbis and Jesse Plemons are phenomenal and they are going all out with these characters which is something that Yorgos is great at doing even if I don't care about his movies. These are some of the most interesting and complex characters I've seen all year long as you're invested in exploring the minds of these people and what makes them tick. There are moments of violence that are shocking with the amount of gore being shown and that was also awesome to see some good practical effects. And finally, the movie is paced very well and this is the shortest of the three Yorgos movies I've seen so far and yet it didn't feel that long.

Overall, Bugonia (2025) is the Yorgos Lanthimos movie that I enjoyed the most so far and it has me interested in exploring his past filmography as well as seeing what he has in store for movie fans as he has my full attention after watching this movie.",literal
"10/10 From Me I'm loving this new show adding more lore to the World of IT and Pennywise. It didn't hold back on the first episode and from then on I've been hooked and waiting patiently as I can go for next weeks to show.

I love the inclusion of a new bunch of kids who know something is off in Derry and start trying to find out what, same with the Army knowing something is out there they could possibly use as a weapon not knowing how the outcome will be when they do discover IT.

I'm also glad they haven't shown a full blown clear image of Pennywise and are slowly trickling it into our viewing.

Overall I'd highly recommend for fans of Stephen Kings works, more lore of Derry and IT. Here's to more series to come 🥂",literal
"Oldman is back in service If you wondered how Gary Oldman could be cast in a spy series after being Smiley once, this show answers the question: quite good. Surprisingly good. With the story material from reputable spy books author, the story as good as it could be. Cast and settings are top notch, jokes are authentic British ones, what else to ask for?

This review was written with only three episodes in, but if you like British spy stuff, this series should be on your watch list, period.",literal
"[6.4] ""Thank you!, message received, not seeking trouble..."" Semi-interesting in its core with great acting and big big chunks of charisma by the main lead and funny situations with her beautiful lawyer lady friend as well as his ""magician"" IT-hack partner. Besides that, the plots are thin and sort of repetitivo-continuous as its base.

Of those series that if renewed (yes!) for a second season could not sustain the momentum IMO. Remember 'Limitless'. Both were and are interesting, but kind of repetitive.

"What a colossal joke. Trash. Just trash I have an actual brain injury. This is not what it is like at all. I hate the non sense where people get up and walk the day after cranial surgery. Brain injury is horrible. Many of us end up unable to walk for years, not hours. The healing journey is years and is slow and painful. It would make for boring tv to see how we really struggle. But to make light of it like this is disgusting. No respect for actual people that go through this. The heartache. The medical bills. The bankruptcy. Being homeless. The panic from the confusion. The disrespect and misunderstanding from everyone around you. That is real. This is stupid and really makes me mad that this is what tv producers think brain injury is really like. Ruins it for people who are actually struggling with the very real problems totally ignored in this ridiculous and insulting show.",figurative
"A Mystery That Solves Itself (Unfortunately) Weapons starts with a hook I couldn't resist - a strange disappearance, multiple perspectives, and a promise of something sinister beneath the surface. The first half had me leaning forward: an intriguing premise, some great character beats (Archer and Justine stand out), and humor that, while organic, never veered into Cabin in the Woods parody territory. For a while, it felt like we might be getting a modern Langoliers or Identity.

But halfway through, the mystery is essentially handed to us in disconnected POV reveals. Instead of participating in the investigation alongside the characters - piecing together clues and sharing the ""aha!"" moment - we're simply told what's happening. The actual ""solving"" comes courtesy of an unlikable meth head, while the characters we care about drift into the background. Archer's detective work, promising at first, amounts to retrieving two ring cams, parking outside the villain's house, and being waved in by the cop. The cop, by the way, and several other side characters get inexplicable amounts of screen time for almost no plot relevance.

The villain, Gladys, is my biggest disappointment. She's just ""evil because she's evil"" - no layered motivation, no escalation of powers, no cosmic or thematic weight. The title Weapons is a complete misfire; her victims aren't weaponized toward any greater purpose. Imagine if she were building a hive-mind army to avenge a centuries-old injustice - now that would be chilling. Instead, she's just a mean old witch feeding off captives in a basement, with no bigger picture. Even striking imagery, like the assault rifle with ""217"" floating over a house, has no payoff.

At 6/10, Weapons is not a bad film. It's competently made, the premise is strong, and there are moments of real intrigue. But for all its style, it leaves behind the most satisfying part of a mystery: the joy of solving it.",literal
"Why ""Eternity"" Deserves Your Attention A cinematic experience that captures 3 lifetimes of love and loss, this film takes you on an emotional journey that has you crying one moment and laughing the next against a beautiful backdrop that is the here-now, purgatory and paradise. The characters are incredibly relatable, each brought to life with performances so genuine that you can feel their struggles and triumphs as if they were your own.",figurative
Best New Show This show is excellent with an excellent cast. I binge watched the first 4 episodes and couldn't wait for the 5th. Please give this show a chance. The actress playing Dr. Larsen really proves the point that she wasn't so nice before the accident. I'm hoping that they let Amy and Jake fall in love all over again and then he can tell her about their relationship. And the guy playing Jake is perfect. The patient stories so far have been very interesting especially the last one with the brothers. I do feel sorry for Michael because I think he is falling in love again. I hope that the mother/daughter storyline doesn't get resolved to soon. You need some things to look forward too.,literal
"Just Saw it Last Night As Someone who didnt saw 1 and 2 before seeing this Movie Well I have a lot to say.

First knowing its a 7pm showing and A Monday on the next day we really taught that only Us(Me and My Mom) Were the only ones who were gonna watch but it turns out 8 groups including us.

I gotta say after watching that film it felt like Its making me wanna watch the rest of the film.

Mark Ruffalos cameo was really unexpecting Isla is back feels like the 1st part didnt have script lots of magic tricks like the cards. Morgans character dies but in a good way. The fact that this isnt the end. The Hatmans are back after I forgot how many years with 3 more members. It felt amazing to watch that film Although I wish it was past 2hours since it felt like it was kinda in a rush but the story was very understandable sometimes. Overall the film was a blast to the past.",literal
"One episode was more than enough Even if you're writing a farce you need to keep one small toe in the real world. The MI5 scene was reminiscent of some of the silly scenes in the Park in Slow Horses. OTT and not witty. Was that Hamsa character cringing and crawling intended to be amusing in some way?

It seems writing OTT behaviour and stupidly quirky or rude exchanges has become a substitute for the old fashioned hard work of getting inside your characters and making them come alive from within.

Pretty bad stuff. Down cemetery road with it indeed.",literal
"Matthew Rhys steals the show A tense cat-and-mouse thriller that keeps you hooked with its twists, even if it stretches believability toward the end. The pacing makes it easy to binge, and the emotional beats land - especially thanks to Matthew Rhys, who absolutely steals the show as Nile Jarvis. His performance adds unexpected depth and charisma to the chaos, making every scene he's in feel sharper and more unpredictable.",figurative
"A little bit confused but enjoyble film ""Old Wounds, New War"" - Review of One Battle After Another (2025) Paul Thomas Anderson isn't the first name you'd expect on a late-career action-thriller about ex-revolutionaries pulling one last job, but that's what makes One Battle After Another so fun to dig into. On the surface it's a rescue picture-there's a kidnapping, a ticking clock, a crew that has to come back together after years of bad blood. Underneath, it's a movie about how people who once believed in something huge are supposed to live when the world has moved on. Anderson threads those two impulses together with style, mood, and a killer cast, and even when the film meanders, it does so with a confidence that's hard to resist.

The setup is neat and immediate. Sixteen years before the main story, a militant leftist group in the US pulled off a violent, headline-making operation against a corrupt energy conglomerate and then scattered. Some cut deals, some disappeared overseas, some tried to turn themselves into respectable citizens. Now their old enemy-an executive who survived and then built himself into a quietly untouchable power broker-has resurfaced. To flush out the last of the old guard and to settle his own score, he has the young daughter of the group's former strategist snatched while she's traveling in Europe. That forces the mother, played with taut, flinty desperation by Teyana Taylor, to call the people she swore she'd never call again. Leonardo DiCaprio's character, once the charismatic face of the movement and now a well-paid crisis consultant in suits he never used to wear, is dragged back in. Regina Hall shows up as the planner who went corporate but never stopped keeping tabs. Wood Harris is the loyal soldier whose life stalled when the revolution died. They all have different lives now, and they all owe each other apologies, but none of that matters until the girl is safe.

Plotwise the movie unfolds in three big chunks. First is the reconnection: everyone has to be convinced, everyone lays out their conditions, and very old arguments surface. Anderson is good at group dynamics, and he lets these scenes run a little longer than a purely commercial thriller would, so you can feel the weight of shared history. Then comes the middle stretch in Europe, where the team chases leads through Marseille back alleys, hotel bars in Lisbon, and finally a heavily surveilled alpine compound. Here the film is at its most propulsive-train platforms, cramped cars, half-remembered tradecraft. The last third is the siege itself, cross-cutting between Taylor trying to reach her daughter and DiCaprio confronting the enemy who has basically built a brand on surviving them. The action is clear and physical, but Anderson never forgets the resentment that brought everyone back together; almost every gunshot is followed by a conversation.

The core cast is doing grown-up, lived-in work. Taylor gives the movie its emotional center. She plays a woman who was once willing to die for an idea, then chose to live for her child instead, and now discovers she has to do both at the same time. DiCaprio, aging into complicated men very comfortably, makes his character the one who sold out most successfully-he speaks in boardroom language now, but you can see the old fire flicker whenever someone mentions what they used to be. Regina Hall is a delight as the practical brain of the operation, the only one who seems to remember that ideals don't open doors, people do. Wood Harris brings gravity and humor, reminding everyone what it cost to stay out of jail. Because these people actually like each other, even when they're mad, the banter plays and the betrayals sting.

Themes are right on the surface. The biggest is about the afterlife of activism. What happens when the revolution fails, or when it half succeeds and the world co-opts the language you bled for? DiCaprio's character argues that they did good, that their target rebranded but still bent to regulation, that their work became policy. Taylor doesn't buy it. For her, the enemy is the enemy, and even worse he's using his resources to hurt her family. That folds neatly into the second theme: the cost of parenthood for people who once believed the personal shouldn't matter. Everyone here made choices sixteen years ago that put ideals over relatives; the movie asks whether you can ever make up for that. A third, quieter theme is the danger of nostalgia. Several times characters start to romanticize the old days, and the film undercuts them with a memory of blood or of someone who didn't make it. The past is useful, Anderson keeps saying, but it's also a trap.

Visually, this is recognizably a Paul Thomas Anderson film even though it's more mobile than, say, Phantom Thread. The camera likes long, confident moves that follow characters through crowded spaces without cutting, letting tension build in real time. When the crew is together, Anderson often frames them in wide group shots so you can watch alliances form within the frame. Color is doing a lot of storytelling: the US prologue has a sun-baked, slightly grainy look that makes the old operation feel like a memory; present-day America is colder and more glassy; Europe is where the movie warms up-deep blues in the port city nights, golden interiors in old hotels, gray white in the mountain sequence. Action scenes are shot with clarity: no shaky-cam blur, just carefully blocked shootouts where we understand who is covering whom. And every now and then Anderson lets the movie breathe with a landscape or rooftop shot, reminding us that the world kept spinning while these people were nursing grudges.

So what works especially well? First, the performances. This is a stacked adult ensemble, and everyone gets at least one scene to rip into old pain. Second, the character-first approach to an action plot. We care about the daughter because we care about her mother; we care about the mission because we've seen what it means to the people doing it. Third, the pacing of the middle act. Once the team is moving, the film hits a really satisfying rhythm of clue, complication, and payoff. Fourth, the look and sound: Anderson and his regular collaborators give the movie a textured, slightly analog feel, and the score-more percussion and low brass than sweeping strings-keeps tension simmering without overwhelming dialogue.

Where does it stumble? At two hours and forty minutes, it runs long. The early ""getting the band back together"" scenes are juicy, but a couple of them repeat the same point-that everybody feels betrayed. Viewers who came mostly for the rescue may get impatient. Because the antagonist is mostly a symbol of corporate power and old injustice, he never becomes as fascinating as the people chasing him; his final confrontation with DiCaprio's character lands, but it doesn't explode. The politics are evocative rather than specific; the movie gestures at energy exploitation, privatized security, and media control, but it rarely drills down far enough to feel razor sharp. And a late twist involving an informant inside the group is telegraphed a bit too clearly to shock.

Conclusion: One Battle After Another is a smart, muscular thriller that lets grown performers play people with history, not just people with guns. It marries the pleasures of a rescue movie-plans, gadgets, narrow escapes-with the melancholy of a ""where did our idealism go?"" drama. It's longer than it needs to be and not every political note rings out, but when the film locks onto Taylor fighting for her daughter or onto DiCaprio realizing he can't outrun who he was, it's gripping in a way studio action rarely is. Anderson may have called it one battle after another, but what he's really made is one big argument about whether the fight was worth it, and why some people can't stop even decades later.",literal
"5 star Usually, I don't like shows about characters that have amnesia as the main character. So that's why I didn't choose to watch the first episode when it aired so I was scrolling on TV and there was absolutely nothing to watch. I was caught up on everything so I thought I'll try it and I'm hooked. I love this show. Well worth watching. You know you like it when you wanna go through the TV and knock a doctor out. Lol. I think the storyline in the second episode was pretty good. Those that are on the fence should watch a few before they make up their mind because the second episode kinda clenches it. So I like it.",literal
"Please end this show I've been with this show since the beginning; it was the best show I'd ever seen up until about season twelvish. Now, all these years later, they're just reusing old storylines on a new cast. Like it's some nighttime soap opera. And the way they had Meredith exit? THE SHOW HAS THE CHARACTER'S NAME IN IT. What a horrible send-off to the character the show's named after. Unfortunately I feel compelled to continue watching since I've been with the show for all this time, but it serves more as background noise than anything else. Do yourself a favor and carefully consider how much time you'll devote to binging this show if you've never seen it before, because it gets worse as the years go on. Maybe stop halfway through?",literal
"Great show, not just a remake I saw the British version of Ghosts first and thought I would hate this. Some characters are nearly exactly the same but some are original and match American history. The stories are original, fun and have a great story line. Yes there is a degree of copy paste but not to the point where it becomes annoying, strangely enough it makes it even better. Like the UK version there is a ghost without pants, a guy with an arrow through his neck, a posh Victorian lady and some sort of barbarian and Sam's interaction with the ghosts is similar but there are very new characters that just make this US version like a brand new show. Love it.",literal
"A deep, thoughtful, and necessary exploration of modern dating ""Materialists"" is a deep, thoughtful, and necessary exploration of modern dating - a sharp social commentary on society, human behavior, and the ways we define love in a materialistic world.

Unlike Past Lives (Celine Song's first masterpiece), it doesn't shy away from being literal or obvious in delivering its message, yet it still leaves space for interpretation and personal reflection.

Thanks to its diverse characters, the film offers multiple relatable perspectives. The cast is outstanding - all favorites of mine - and this may be my favorite Dakota Johnson performance yet.

Overall, it's a refreshing take on the genre, and with this film, Celine Song proves she's one of my favorite voices in contemporary cinema, going two for two.",figurative
"When it's good, it's very good An excellent cast, let down occasionally by lackluster scripts. Brilliant episodes are usually followed by mediocre ones, usually centered around personnel problems and the like.

If you've never seen it, check out Eamonn's episodes in which his personality practically leaps from the screen.",literal
"A Flashy Return to the World of Illusion Now You See Me: Now You Don't invites you back into a world where nothing is ever as it seems, and every illusion hides an even bigger twist. Packed with high-energy heists, charismatic performers, and a fresh layer of magical misdirection, this new instalment brings the Horsemen back to the spotlight with style. It's the kind of movie that asks you to sit back, trust nothing, and enjoy the ride - because in this game, the real trick is keeping up.

Now You See Me: Now You Don't marks the long-awaited return of the Four Horsemen, and the film wastes no time dropping viewers back into the high-energy blend of heist thrills and theatrical magic that made the franchise a hit. While the story continues to play by the rules of spectacle over depth, this new instalment delivers an undeniably fun ride that feels both familiar and refreshed.

One of the film's biggest strengths lies in the chemistry of its returning cast. Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Dave Franco, and Isla Fisher slip back into their roles with a lively, effortless charm. Their dynamic - equal parts competitive, mischievous, and loyal - remains the heart of the film. This time, they're joined by a trio of younger illusionists whose presence creates an interesting generational contrast. Their banter and contrasting styles introduce new energy without overshadowing the original team.

Visually, the movie leans more into practical illusions than digital flash, and the result is a set of sequences that feel more grounded and tactile than those of the previous film. Mirror rooms, misdirection-based escapes, and classic sleight-of-hand tricks give the story a handcrafted feel, even as the film globe-trots between lavish settings and high-stakes showpieces. It's fast-paced, glossy, and confidently staged - exactly what fans of the franchise expect.

Where the film wobbles is in its storytelling. With a larger ensemble, not every character gets the development they deserve, and some emotional beats feel rushed. The plot relies on heavy exposition at moments where the narrative could have benefited from more organic reveals. Certain tropes from the earlier movies reappear in ways that feel safe rather than inventive. But even with these limitations, the film maintains a light, playful tone that makes it easy to enjoy without overthinking.

Rosamund Pike pulls of an South Africa accent, and as a fellow South African, I was deeply impressed. There were many references to South Africa which really made me enjoy the movie even more.

Thematically, the story touches on legacy, mentorship, and the tension between old-school craft and modern innovation. The film doesn't dwell deeply on these ideas, but they give the spectacle enough grounding to keep it from feeling hollow. At its core, it remains a stylish, escapist heist-magic hybrid that understands its own appeal.

In the end, Now You See Me: Now You Don't is not the franchise's most surprising entry, but it is certainly one of its most enjoyable. It knows what it is - a slick, charming crowd-pleaser - and it delivers exactly that. Fans of the previous movies will appreciate the return of the Horsemen's wit and flair, while newcomers can sit back and enjoy the illusion. I rate this move a 7 out of 10.

If you're in the mood for a smartly staged, quick-moving piece of entertainment that blends heists with showmanship, this film is worth the watch. The magic may not reinvent itself, but it still dazzles.

The movie runs for 1 hour and 52 minutes and doesn't leave any last minute tricks in the form of a post-credits scene, but the movie ends in such a way that makes me think that the Director may have some more tricks up the sleeve.",literal
"A Great Show, now let it end as is. This was a really well made show. Well acted and written. You can go on and on about all the good things in this show and the characters and their strengths and flaws and how well most were written and acted. It was overall great. Now it's time to ignore the urge to keep it going. It will never be a better show from here. It will only get old and tired and as more ridiculous themes and stories emerge it will crash and burn and just be fodder. I know it won't happen but I only can wish it does. Most really good shows usually hit their peak after the first season but by season 4 they stretched thin . This one hit it in season 1 and won't be better. Live and let Die.",literal
"Elements of Justified and vigilante shows like Reecher and Predator It's a nice show. It's just very formulated and it's got a lot of Reacher and Justified tracking and character elements. A tough but good-looking guy goes around the USA in his personal RV and truck seeking tracker targets.

He doesn't have the skills to look them up online so utilises a geek guy (very typical role again but nice to see a bit of diversity in the role here) who does the job of finding the electronic finger prints.

Additionally he has a team of girls looking after other reseources of information. It's a bit strange that he relies on three people yet expertly manages to navigate his way in the field.

There was enough interesting plot-lines to keep me hooked and I binged it in a whole afternoon however it is already a genre which has been used a lot and the acting was ok not amazing. Therefore it gets a good 7. I feel the creators directed it well and there is some talent with the directing and screenplay.

Unfortunately there's just already so much good stuff like this and it is not as good as those despite it coming across with a fresh tracker concept. You can change a little script point but the concept and execution are similar to others.",literal
"Binged it in a day I got totally hooked. I was desperately looking for a new Series to watch and finally I found something. In my opinion the cast is lovely and the story exciting.

Gorgeous The outfits are worth watching the show. The costume designers did a stunning job. The characters are difficult to support but that's part of the fun. There are many mysteries that are interesting to watch unravel. It is a delectable sight to see. Shows now don't have the same style as they did in the 60's. This is truly an amazing show for Kristen Wiig. It is wonderful to see so many amazing and strong actresses share the screen. It truly is one of the better shows Apple TV has put out in a while. It is captivating. Seeing Maxine yearn to be accepted the viewer sees everything she desires and can understand how she might want to belong to such a glamorous society.,literal
"Bewitchment at another level !!!!!!! Straight to the point - the movie is good. Not great, not bad, just good. The first half is very engaging and I'd say it was great. But after watching the second half, I felt it was just a good movie overall. Since I'm Indian, I already know the concept used in the movie, and I've seen other films made on the exact same idea. One great example is the Gujarati movie Vash. While watching the second half, I couldn't help but think it's almost the same story - especially because I had just seen the Vash 2 trailer a few days ago. It felt like the same plot, with only a few aspects changed, lol.",figurative
"Something felt Missing This was one of my most anticipated movies but it was disappointing for me.

Now for pros

1. It had some really good CGI at some points. Atleast it did The Thing right. He is being done dirty for a long time.

2. There was chemistry between the cast. The chemistry was better than 2015 version but it wasn't better than the 2005 one.

3. Galactus was done right you could feel his presence in IMAX.

4. I liked Joseph Quinn. He kept the legacy alive of good human torches.

Now for cons

1. Pedro was such a miscast. He played himself. He is not right for Reed.

2. It has more wacky shots than the good ones. The CGI looks unfinished at some points.

3. It was poorly edited. We know they cut 15 to 20 minutes and you could feel it. Something was missing.

4. CGI baby. I think it's about time they stop using the CGI baby. It was giving uncanny vibes.

5. Reed was really underwhelming. He barely used his powers.

6. Although it was only 1 hour 55 minutes long yet it felt longer than other movies which are longer. The pacing was horrible.

7. Most of it was spoiled in the trailers. If you saw all promotional videos and trailer you just saw 50 percent of the movie.

8. The last act was horrible. It felt like that Yelena scene from Black Widow.

9. This movie felt like it was missing a whole act. They should have given creative control to the director.

10. They could have done the post credit better.

This was a misfire by marvel and they should be worried beacuse it is directly related to Doomsday. It is really average. It places at 2nd last in the ranking of 2025 CBM.

I am really disappointed. Fantastic four are one of my favourite characters and they missed another time. When we will get a good F4 film? That's the question.",literal
"A film that burns, slowly and beautifully Very enjoyable film with real depth and outstanding performances from Lawrence and Pattinson. This is a character study first and foremost - a portrait of a woman in turmoil and a relationship stretched to its limits. The film portrays severe mental-health collapse in a way that feels raw and unfiltered. Grace clearly shows signs of postpartum depression, but there are also moments that to me resemble traits associated with borderline personality disorder. None of it is neat, labelled or simplified - and that's exactly why it works.

Ramsay's direction is exceptional. The atmosphere is suffocating in the best way, the cinematography is beautiful, and the music fits the emotional landscape perfectly. The world they create is full of tiny details that slowly pull you in and don't let go. It's a story built on nuance, ambiguity and emotional tension.

The ending is especially powerful: Grace walks into the forest fire, after burning her writing, as if trying to burn the version of herself that can no longer survive. Jackson watches, realising he can't save her. He loves her - but ""die, my love."" It's tragic, poetic, and exactly the kind of ending more films should dare to have.

I love films that refuse to tie everything up neatly, that don't hand you a simple, comforting resolution. This one leaves you wondering, questioning, feeling. If some reviewers don't understand that, they should probably stick to blockbusters and stop attempting to watch films that function like literary fiction.

P. S. It also had a few funny moments where I laughed out loud.",figurative

I am sorry to say that I was left wholly disappointed in the final (7th) series, especially the final episode. To me it felt as if the show needed a more deserving ending. I'm not sure if the writers had changed or if they just didn't have any better ideas for the show to end. Such a shame.

The acting throughout is top notch, and Edie Falco's and Merrit Wever's Emmy awards were so deserved.

"Sterlin Harjo is a master of storytelling. Okay I'm biassed because I loved Reservation Dogs. I found it to be one of the most unique series in recent memory. I admire the way Sterlin Harjo conceptualizes narratives and seamlessly weaves characters, setting, and story into highly engaging and engrossing TV.

The Lowdown is just as poignant, lighthearted, and meaningful as Reservation Dogs. Every element of the production - casting, writing, dialogue, filming locations, costume design, cinematography, and especially cultural representation - has been carefully thought out to convey multiple nuanced layers of storytelling. The result is a delightful and engaging series with an uncannily comforting vibe.

This show is a 10/10 for me. I can't wait to see what more is to come from Sterlin Harjo.",literal
"Why Do Adults Always Lie? It was going to happen at some point that someone turns this real life industry into a major film. The Japanese rental family introduces all kinds of moral issues.

Brendan Fraser's Philip is a struggling American actor in Tokyo. He doesn't buy into being a fake husband, father, journalist, or friend easily. He properly conveys the moral weight of the rental family while making the best of this situation.

This is potentially heavy material, Yes people's lives are affected, often for the better and sometimes for the worse, but it's handled in a lighthearted engaging way.

It may feel cliché the way things ultimately unravel but this is a smartly made film that leaves you with something to think about.",literal
"Love, Pragmatism, and a Hint of Propaganda I found Materialists to be a good romantic drama that refreshingly looks at mid-life dating in a very practical way. Pascal and Evans were excellent, both bringing real presence and nuance to their roles, but Dakota Johnson felt too monotonous. Her delivery lacked the spark to match theirs.

The film doesn't do a good job of mixing pragmatism with romance, and at times it feels a little one sided, almost like a broke boyfriend propaganda film. Still, it has moments that work well and makes for a relatable watch for anyone navigating love with real world baggage.",literal

"""Prey"" A Breakout Performance For FBI Characters Although the first two episodes of the pilot, FBI, were very good, the characters stood out more as individuals than as a team. In ""Prey"", they played off one another much better and there was much more emotion in their performances. Especially Jeremy Sisto, who was fantastic in Law & Order, but who has a much different role as floor team leader Jubal Valentine in FBI. Missy Peregrym has been the strongest character from the beginning, but this episode allowed her to show more emotion and humanity than the previous two episodes. Same goes for her partner, Omar Adom played by Zeeko Zaki - as well as their dependence on one another as partners. Another standout character is analyst Kristen Chazal, played by Ebonee Noel. She is smart, quick-witted and her special talents compliment the team very well. Looking forward to further character development on this promising new show.",figurative

"Wait....did they forget to write a screenplay? After a pretty decent first season, viewers are now into episode seven of the second season and many must be thinking (like me): ""Wait, did they forget to actually write a screenplay for season 2?"".

There is really nothing intriguing about this show during this season. Storylines, dialogue and character development; it's all really ""mèèèh"" at best this time around and mostly really just boring and uninteresting.

Dialogues just seem never-ending and are not compelling in the slightest.

Of course I noticed on various other Apple shows as well that screenwriting is apparently not in the list of requirements set by Apple.

But they could have at least tried, right? Talented actors and most likely tons of money to spend.

What a complete waste of budget and talent this show has become... just a pile of garbage to be really honest.

"The show was great until they fired Tyler I believe Smiling Friends was in its prime during its first season and the beginning of season 2. However, the quality of the show experienced a sharp decline following S2 EP7: The Magical Red Jewel (aka Tyler Gets Fired). During this episode, Tyler, who was considered to be the best written and most popular character in the history of the show was fired by Mr. Boss. I have no idea what was going through the producers heads when they made the decision to have Tyler get fired, but I sincerely hope they get the help that they need. That being said, this show is absolute garbage and will continue to be a shell of its former self. 0/10, would not recommend.",literal
"Absolutely CENIMA ! In modern times we sadly know all too well the lust for fame deranged political and serial killers have. With minds lost to the idea they will be remembered. All to often they are. I'm not sure if I should take comfort to know even in Garfields time this issue existed, or that now his killer will be slightly more remembered. That aside the shows sets and design are amazing. The acting is outstanding. Nothing particularly amazing in the camera work there is hardly any need for it. The pacing and story keep things moving and I personally found the not so well known story to be a fantastic ride. If you set aside your questions for whether or not the story should be told you'll find nothing to critic in this mini-series, I can't think of anything I would change. I would have to say it has been my favorite of the year. (Review for others: its like Lincoln but way darker and funnier. Also it somehow feels shorter! More cursing, nudity, and gore my dude!

"Great until season 9 A series that has 11 seasons first has to work for the entire time. Actually, most series run out of steam after 2 seasons, but Shameless made it to season 9 for me. After that, my interest dropped abruptly, actually with the departure of Fiona. After that, some episodes seemed torturously drawn out and the cheekiness of the first seasons was gone and sometimes just seemed like tired rehashes. There is a lot to discover here in terms of acting, the entire cast is brilliant, camera, set design, everything fits together as one.

"Season 14 (Spoilers) Am I the only one thinks that Season 14 is lacking something N.C.I.S. used to have? I am kind of disappointed with this season. Sure, I watch each and every episode and look forward to the next, but; somehow or other, the action seems to revolve less about homicides and N.C.I.S. purpose and more on the personal relationships of its members. Furthermore, the cases that N.C.I.S. got this whole season seem to be very lame compared to the cases from previous seasons. I am writing this because I noticed that while watching the episodes of this season, if I get a phone call, I pause the recording to answer the phone, while in the past, I would let the call go to voicemail so as not to interrupt my watching. I feel that the departures of Cote de Pablo, first, followed by Michael Weatherly took something from the show and that whatever was lost has not yet been replaced. Ducky has fewer lines while Palmer seems to get more attention and is just as funny. Abby is Abby and McGee is not as prominent as before. In my opinion, I feel that the writers seem to also have lost their touch.

This really saddens me because last year, I bought the DVD's for all the seasons which I had missed, and I remember binge-watching them like there was no tomorrow. Let's just hope that things pick up for the next couple of episodes or for next season.",literal
"Absolutely ridiculous, but that was expected Chad Powers is absolutely ridiculous (maybe even terrible) but we expected that based on Eli Manning's skit.

The Adonai Mitchell play happening 24 hours before Chad Powers release makes the show that much more ridiculous (but in a good way).

Glen Powell looks 50 in this, and he went 75% Radio, which is quite impressive for someone who might possibly be at the pinnacle of their career.

You have to respect Powell for taking the role, hopefully the script adds some heart to the story, making Chad Powers a redeemable character, and making this a worthy watch.

The first two episodes are absurd, not quite hitting the Ted Lasso tone it appears to be emulating.

I hold out hope for the season and story arcs to improve, but thus far, Chad Powers and its giant P-Hole are missing the toilet (mark).",literal
"Final Season is a huge disaster Final season would look like it was rushed, character development goes down the drain of few main characters. Somehow they stop following their own traits, for e.g Varys does everything in his hand to preserve the realm, seeing his character from past 7 season one can never think he just dies by giving hisaelf up like that. Same goes for Jaime Lannister, he was redeeming himself over the seasons and now he won't get his page in book of brothers filled with good stuff about him. Biggest disappointment was there was no background of Night King even in Season 8.",literal
"The quintessential All-American Classic! Stands the test of time! When you were growing up, what would you remember about your summer vacations? Was it the time you played together with friends without the worry of schoolwork? This movie perfectly captures the spirit of American summertime with baseball being the theme of the movie. Unlike other sports movies which follows a cliche (losers slowly becoming champions), this one is in a class in and of itself. At least one of us can relate to Scotty Smalls story of how he gets to find friends after moving from another town. It's hard at first, but soon he connects with the coolest kids on the block and go on many adventures, many involve swimming in the pool, dealing with some rivals, fireworks, dealing with rivals, a day at the carnival, and the biggest challenge yet to come. The cherry on top? Plenty of messages about what's important in life. I watched this movie many times as a kid and now as an adult, even now, the power of this movie has never lost its touch. You can be an adult and reflect about your summer with friends as you watch this by yourself or with people you know and love. It's a movie to remember forever. One of my favorite movies!",literal
"Calling it Overrated is an understatement This was a lousy rendition of Superman. David Corenswet's performance felt like he took most of his inspiration from Zachary Levi. Lex was whiny and annoying and by no means menacing and whomever thought of the robot monkeys influencing social media should be fired, the 90's Animated series never went that cheesy.

The plot was too cluttered, so many side stories, non of them felt fully resolved. The over crowding of characters also felt rushed and very little character development occurred.

I honestly would place Superman III and Superman Returns ahead of 2025 and after spending $60 for two tickets, two small popcorns and two waters, I really want to put The Quest For Peace ahead of it aswell.",literal
"Season 1 and it's an instant classic Following ""Severance"" for the past two months as each weekly episode drops reminds you of just how wonderful it is to witness things as they unfold for the first time. Well-cast, brilliantly-directed and edited, with one of the most spellbinding opening sequences in recent TV history, ""Severance"" is the perfect blend of Sci-fi, human interest, mystery, dystopia, and dark comedic undertones. ""Black Mirror"" is the only comparison that comes to mind but that show falls under the anthology category, therefore ""Severance"" is quite unlike any TV series you've ever seen before. As the mystery unfolds, you can't help but think about the layers upon layers of possibilities and various implications. While the early episodes may appear ho-hum, buzzing slowly, they are actually intricately developing each textured character if you pay close attention, positioning you for a satisfying payoff. Every actor stands out in their own right, from the trusty lead Adam Scott to veterans Patricia Arquette, John Torturo, Christopher Walken to Tramell Tillman as Milchick, my surprise favorite. This show is complex, and so for those who have not seen this yet and want to be entertained (Defiant Jazz!) and mentally stimulated at the same time, I recommend not waiting much longer to start S1E1!",literal
"Intense and disturbing We thought this was great on so many levels. I cannot relate to any of the negative reviews regarding acting or plot issues. We thoroughly enjoyed it! Yes, there were disturbing factors, but that is true in life as well, unfortunately. There were also great lessons to be learned, definitely a cautionary tale.",literal
"Truly awful ""comedy"" Truly unpleasant view of a young woman (Jennifer Lawrence) post-natal, living in squalor and going mad. She's supposed to be a writer but we never see that, beyond dripping fluids on a piece of paper. I find these films tough: if the character doesn't give a damn about themselves, why should I? Nobody is likeable in Die My Love. It's an ugly movie from start to finish.",literal
"Watchable, but generic... Yup, I had never actually heard about this 2025 movie titled ""Good Fortune"" prior to stumbling upon it. But seeing the movie's cast ensemble, I have to say that I figured that the movie would be worth checking out.

Seeing that the movie was written by, directed by and starring Aziz Ansari, I have to say that my expectations dropped a notch. Not because of Aziz Ansari, but because movies that have one guy doing everything usually tends to be questionable affairs.

Well, as it turned out, the storyline was adequate. It was not a great story, but it proved to be watchable for what it was. Though I can't claim to be particularly impressed.

The movie does have a fair amount of familiar faces on the cast list, with the likes of Keanu Reeves, Seth Rogen, Sandra Oh, Keke Palmer and Aziz Ansari. The acting performances in the movie were good.

While ""Good Fortune"" is a fair enough movie, it is hardly one that warrants more than a single viewing, as it was sort of generally bland.

My rating of writer and director Aziz Ansari's 2025 movie ""Good Fortune"" lands on a flat five out of ten stars.",literal
"fantastic tv show The second i seen a Ted Danson tv show, i rushed to click it as most of hies stuff are amazing

Ted knows how to combine drama with comedy very good.

For a lot of time i didnt laough out loud so much as i did in this tv show its just like a candy that you never want to end its emotional, its true, its real, its fantastic acting and its funny as can be.

At times it makes you roll on the floor from laoughing at times make you cry at times your hyped at the little cameos they did from ""the good place""

it was really as perfact as perfact goes

the best i could describe this tv show is an incredable sensitive true and emotional story of growing old wrapped inside a very funny comedy

everyone in this show are great actors from ""Didi"" - stephani beatriz (mirable from.encanto) to Ted danson, stephen henderson really all amazing actors and the fact that Ted and Mark jakson both play here after they been in ""the good place"" is just the whipped cream on a really good cake.

The only thing i didnt like was the fact it ended but at the ending i literely stood up all teard up and shouted yesssssssss !!!! All alone in the apartment.

I hope a lot that they will do a season 2.

This deserves it most then all.",literal
"Gary Oldman you monster!! Gary Oldman has already proved himself as a master in the political and espionage thriller sub-genres, with his powerful performance in the Oscar-winning ""The Darkest Hour (2017)"" as well as the more understated by equally effective ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (2011)"". He has portrayed gravitas, charisma, calm under pressure as well as steadfast efficiency very well on screen but Apple TV+'s new offering showcases an altogether different dimension to the British veteran, one laced with dry British wit and wry humour while never letting up on the espionage thrill elements.

We follow the story of MI5 agent ""Jackson Lamb"" (Oldman) who runs a sub-group within the intelligence agency dubbed the ""Slow Horses"" since it is primarily composed of disgraced, underperforming has-beens who no one else seems to want. Lamb seems perfectly happy running routine operations and surveillance gigs when his team gets inadvertently embroiled in a kidnapping of a Muslim youngster, presumably executed by right-wing fundamentalists.

Featuring Jonathan Pryce, Kristin Scott-Thomas, Saskia Reeves, Jack Lowden and a host of fine British actors, Slow Horses takes care to paint vivid character sketches of its motley crew of temperamental agents, all with a point to prove given their sordid pasts. Director James Hawes builds his narrative slowly but self-assuredly across six wholesome episodes, which are full of unexpected twists and turns as the stakes get progressively higher and the conspiracy, more convoluted as the team tracks down one lead after another.

Oldman is in blistering form as the caustic, trash-talking spymaster who seems to use mockery and disdain as weapons to get his team to perform and the supporting cast play an able foil to the old master, creating a vivid world that intrigues as well as makes you chuckle at the most unexpected junctures. The writing from Morwenna Banks; Will Smith; Jonny Stockwood; Mark Denton deserve special praise for striking the right balance between character development, suspense, unexpected twists and humour. Apple TV+ has another winner on its hands, with ""Slow Horses"", alongside ""Severance"" clearly emerging as one of the Best new series of 2022. Highly recommended and I cannot wait for Season 2!",figurative
"Now, there is no logic Is this script written by AI? Fragmented elements pieced together to create a clown show with absolutely no logic.

I lowered my expectations, but this movie is still terribly bad! It lacks the fresh plot and creative ideas of the first film, and the spectacular special effects of the second. Are Hollywood movies these days only able to cash in on nostalgia?",literal
"the best show in adult swim that i ever saw The show was just amazing its short and funny i never stopped a second and felt bored its just an amazing show, i also loved the voice acting and the characters as well the animation was amazing too.",literal
"I can now feel what people felt during the release of Across The Spider-Verse. The trailer showed too much for people that don't know the story. A lot of the final 30 mins were at the beginning of the trailer so why bother spliting this story. Just make a long film that feels complete.

I can now feel what people felt during the release of Across The Spider-Verse. That had a fantastic cliffhanger with story arcs that were left in a satisfying place for the two main leads. Wicked feels like an actual half film. 2 hr 40 mins and we just get going with her becoming the wicked witch and it ends and the worst place. Felt so dragged out too with her just flying around. So much fat on this film.

Despite all that, both leads are good in the film with amazing voices. All the songs are fine but I feel they should scream replayability and work with the story. It only achieves the latter and barely, these songs are stretched. Elphaba sings all the way to the end of a cliff and then walks back, one example of this film being extra.

The film should be so filled with colour and blind me with it but it feels like it's got an MCU filter over it minimizing the pop.

For a long film, the plot can be said in 3 lines and this is a prequel so any reveals are already known. Giving this a 3 star is being generous since I did enjoy watching it.",literal
"Not another one... Recycles doctor/ER bullcrap. When are we gonna stop this? Its House, meets ER with a touch or Resident and Grey's Anatomy. If you like soapy doctor stuff this is for you.

"I'd have Keanu Reeves as my ""Budget Guardian Angel any day! As a Keanu Reeves fan I was looking forward to seeing this movie. It was light hearted with a moral story and full of laughs.

I left the movie theatre wanting more!",literal
"if Disney made a predator movie Love the og predator movie, also love Prey.

Was excited for this one being the same creator as Prey and was looking forward to the franchise being back in action.

Unfortunately they totally humanized the predator race, inadvertently making them no longer scary. On top of that the humor and the dialogue were very out of place.

Basically an action movie, and the action was good. But the humor and constant dialogue- along with the weird Russian inflection they gave the predators did not land.

Not a bad watch but significantly worse than Prey.",literal
"Brilliant, if you accept it on its own terms The film's primary interest is in breaking down a systemic problem into its component parts, and then dramatizing those parts. If you can view it on its own terms instead of trying to impose conventional expectations about structure and storytelling onto it, it's a masterpiece.

(Spoiler warning.)

People with critical knowledge might have taken the day off work. Interceptor missiles might miss their target. Other countries might not cooperate in a crisis. Mutually assured destruction might not keep us safe because countries losing the game of the global economy might see overturning the game board as their most rational move.

But the movie really shines in its depiction of the personal failings that no system can take into account.

A FEMA administrator who delays her response because an inbound nuke can't possibly be a real thing that is happening. A secretary of defense more concerned with making sure his daughter survives than with keeping the public safe. And a president whose skill set prepared him to win an election, not to decide the fate of the world with only minutes to consider the decision. The plausibility behind the president abdicating the decision to a random military aide because he doesn't feel prepared is the most chilling part of the movie.

Even the repeated motif of characters' interest in competitive sports is a metaphor for the human drives that led us to this point.

And the film does all this while moving at a breakneck pace, every moving part interacting with five other moving parts as they all hurtle toward foreseeable failure.

Yes, one scene got a bit preachy. But on the whole, this film is art at its most socially incisive.",figurative

"Great if you're adolescent, nothing like the Predator of old I have conflicted feelings about this one. There's a strong sense of immaturity watching this film, the Disneyfication of Predator franchise, there's no denying that. We have the classic Disney theme of friends on an adventure, with cute xeno-species and plenty of morale-preaching and for-exposition-only dialogue you'd think a Predator would put an end to with a well aimed shot from a shoulder-mounted plasma cannon. There's even a couple of shots copying (or was it stealing?) from the Fellowship of the Ring, with the fellowship advancing along a mountain ridge path (you'll know it when you see it).

Like a few others have said, if I squint my eyes just a little, this is Predator in the name only -- it could have been any other franchise on another world that makes little difference as the plot advances along the lines that feel all too familiar. Then, just as the plot takes a turn you'd think would add the much needed complexity, it was just another arch-villain. Then everything is tied neatly back into what is Disney's well tried story scheme, the closest you'll get to a ""happily ever after"".

I'll be frank -- there's plenty of people who would love this movie, especially in current period I consider a drought in cinema. Badlands isn't as bad as some of the other movies of this franchise, it's just that it resolutely and confidently leaps along the same direction that its predecessors had to crawl along. So in essence, it's just a better made bad Predator movie IMO.

The bad part is that it has stripped the franchise of what in my mind constituted the value here -- a cunning, intelligent predator of _different_ intelligence and ethics/morale, that comes head to head with the homo sapiens, another prominent killer made by evolution, with gore worthy of David Cronenberg. Predator franchise has never been Cannes material exactly, but it also never was Disney-like resignation to cookie-cutter villainry. Now it has the distinction of only avoiding the former.

Perhaps the cinematic medium is dead for this kind of film. Interestingly enough, I am quite hyped for Killer of Killers by the same director. It seems animation attracts fewer vultures, giving the people who understand what they want, more freedom to get that done. This has Disney product sales department written all over it. Or let's call it Teen Predator: Badlands.

Giving it a 6 because of the action scenes and the fact the plot isn't one short straight line at least.",literal
"Entertaining But... I usually take tv shows with a grain of salt, as long as they're entertaining, and this was, but the utter cluelessness and blatant stupidity of the cops was unbelievable. I say this in March of 2021, after witnessing in real life the dumbest, most incompetent and surreal idiocy in history, so that's saying something. Still, a good watch.",literal
"Is Weird Science a piece of cinematic cheese? Yes, undeniably. Is it a must-see? Hell yeah! Sure, Weird Science is not a spectacular film. It will never be mentioned in a history of film class, and watching it fifteen years after its release shows that time has not been kind to it at all. But as a good, fun comedy, it lives on forever. 

Just as computers were really beginning to make a big impression on the world, a couple of geeky kids, Gary (Anthony Michael Hall) and Wyatt (Ian Mitchell Smith), decide to create a girlfriend for themselves using Wyatt's 'sophisticated' computer. The way that they actually design her, although ridiculously unrealistic, is hilarious! 

Weird Science is what I like to call a ""Cheese Classic."" It required minimal talent to put it together, but there is an element of endless amusement that can be found in the film that makes it great. From the bras on Wyatt's and Gary's heads during the creation process to countless inexplicably hilarious pieces of dialogue (""Wyatt, your kitchen is blue...""), Weird Science is a true comedy classic. 

It is, however, the film which probably had the most mixed reviews until the Blair Witch Project, so I suggest watching it for yourself. Just keep in mind that it is meant to be laughed at, not learned from!",literal
"Amazing What can be said about Game of Thrones that hasn't already been said? It's universally thought of as one of the best series in the history of television. Look up any ""best shows ever"" list and I promise you'll find Game of Thrones near the top of every list you'll find. Obviously everyone knows the last episode was absolutely awful, even most of the actors have come out and said they didn't like it. Having said that, it doesn't take away from the show being amazing. One bad show doesn't take away from the other 72 episodes that were almost perfect! I've watched the entire series all the way through twice now and if anything I just appreciate this show even more.",figurative
"A long time coming So I succesfully avoided major spoilers about the show and could binge watch this since the complete Box set came out in early December. The first season was a bit overwhelming, what with all the houses and characters thrown at you. As you may be able to tell, I have not read the source material. Not sure who of the cast had read it beforehand either. So bare that in mind.

Now the line Winter is coming is something everyone associates with the show, I just never expected this to come up so early in the show. What is surprising, at least during the first seasons of the show, is how many supposedly main characters fail to survive. This keeps the viewers on their tows. Towards the end of the show this gets a bit watered down. Not sure how much influence the original author had there (he had only written material for the first 6 seasons of the show, the rest was made up).

Having said that, you can feel a drop in quality. And while I have friend who thought the second season was boring (it's a bit of a travelling show and things get stretched quite a bit), if he continued to watch, he might feel even worse with the last seasons. Even though they are shorter (episode wise, not time wise per episode), they feel stretched even more.

Also the conclusion (no worries, I'm not telling) is anticlimatic to say the least. It feels bad and the continuity errors are just thrown aside. So if not for the epic battles and the actors, who are all really amazing in this, I might have gone farther down with my vote. Then again, if it wasn't for the last season specifically, I might have given it a 10 too ... A prequel show has been axed for now (not sure if the bad reviews and or numbers for the last season played a role), but I would watch it. This achieved overall something that ""The Reign"" could not: combine violence, fantasy and nudity into something mature/adult that works for men and women watching",figurative
"It's not that bad, but not that great either I started watching this show over half a year ago, and I'm still not done. Why? Because it's simply just not a show you can cling on to. I get it, this isn't a crazy show with wild stories, but it can still drive you mad if you watch too much at a time. Personally I find Rory dull and not a very exciting character, considering she's the lead role, but I do love the rest of the characters, especially Lorelai and Luke. I just think more could've been done with this show. I especially think Rory could've had a little more personality and I wish she'd act like an actual teenager so that she's relatable, but she's not in any way. She has boys running after her and got accepted into Yale, Princeton and Harvard. No way is that realistic in any way for any teenage girl. The writers made her life too easy, and that makes it immediately boring. I wouldn't really recommend this show to anyone who has too big of a personality.",figurative
"No longer watchable, especially after Henry Cavill left. I have not read the books but have played the games. Season 1 was good. Season 2 was not good. Yennefer would never jeopardize Ciri's life, they are writing their own story, and changing the original IP. Why bother? Just make your own show then, do not destroy the Witcher series. The disturbing part is, it is very apparent that their writing is plain bad. One second Yennefer wants to exploit Ciri, another second she is a changed person. Why not just stick with the original story? Anyways, after Henry Cavill leaves, I am not going to watch it anymore. Not worth the time. I give 8.5 for Season 1 and 6.6 for Season 2.",literal
"I tried to like it! I thought this could be funny but a whole season, wasn't sure of that. Sorry to say the first episode probably answered my question. Even what could have been funny bits felt flat. Sometimes trying to hard be funny turns laughs into uncomfortable silence. I'll give it one more episode before I stop watching.",literal
"Excellent Season two is nothing short of great. Story line is perfect, casting is spot on and a season ending cliff hanger you probably won't see coming. Builds on the first season and doesn't disappoint.

Keri Russel is the ambassador and Rufus Sewal is perfect as the husband who doesn't want to interfere until he wants to interfere.

Great setup for season 3. Allison Janey plays the veteran politician VP and as usual doesn't disappoint. The supporting cast is a hold over from season 1 and Ali Ahn & Ato Essandoh shine as the CIA Chief of Station and Charge d'Affaird.

One of the best shows currently on TV. The only drawback is just 6 episodes in season two.",figurative
"better The first episode is a bit of a mess. I'm glad I watched the second one. It was much better. There is a bit of a surprise in it, I won't give it away but, it isn't bad. Overall, I'm going to give it a few more episodes, although TBH this weekly thing Apple has, and Amazon, is a bit annoying. But, I'll keep watching, or maybe wait until it's down completely. Not sure yet.",literal
"This really stole my heart I know this rating might seem really high, but you can't deny how incredible the acting was from Channing Tatum and Kirsten Dunst. The movie hits so many emotions - it's funny at times, deeply emotional, suspenseful, and full of heart.

It tells several stories at once: what it feels like to be a father who no longer feels loved or seen, the pain of not being able to be around your kids, and the struggle of always putting others first even when it leads to mistakes. It's a powerful look at kindness, regret, and the need for connection.

Knowing it's based on a true story makes it even more unbelievable - the intelligence and heart behind everything he does really stand out. This might honestly be one of Channing Tatum's best performances yet. I truly loved this movie and everything it had to say about love, loss, and second chances.",literal
"Supernatural family for life. You can really sum it up to one sentence. Supernatural family for life.

I have watched this TV show since season two, re-watched it countless times, that's hundreds of hours of my life just for one show, and better believe that I don't regret a second of it. There's no greater joy than watching this show, I have the Winchester tattoo, and one day I will watch this show with my kids. Yeah. It's that good. It has absolutely everything that you want out of the TV show. If you're reading this give it a shot, at least watch the first two seasons and trust me you'll be hooked. I know that most shows get stail and kind of boring after countless seasons, but Supernatural never did. See for yourself.",literal
"Did the Producers ever watch NCIS ??? Bad casting, Gibbs is a good 6 inches taller than he was in the series, Mike Franks is the short guy now, I believe that in season 7 we found out that Gibbs hadn't seen his father since living for active duty, and yet here he is in the 1st episode of origins which takes place only a short time after Gibbs joins NIS, and if you think Leroy's growth spirt was something, his father grew a good 10 to 12 inches and put on weight.

A lot of things can be over looked when creating, spinoff but the casting for this series could have been much better and retained a bit of continuity between the 2 series.",literal
"This was highly recommended. I watched this season because it was highly recommended. I have to admit that I nearly didn't bother after the first two episode's. But I presumed it had to get better. Well yes it did, but only mildly. If you need to fill some time and don't have much of an intellect, then this will appeal to you. This will no doubt offend the person who recommended it to me. But it was so derivative, I seemed to be able to know exactly what was going to happen, minutes before it did. It reminded me of the numerous movies I watched back in the late '70's and early 80's. There has to be something better on the small screen? Please someone tell me where to find it?????",literal
"Long-winded set up merely to sell a punchline ending Started off promisingly, but then lost its way.

The film began intriguingly enough -- uncertainty about what was happening kept me engaged, waiting for the story to unfold and reveal its deeper layers. But everything changed once the school principal ran into the gas station. That moment marked the turning point where the film ""jumped the shark."" From there, it felt like the narrative was rushing toward a predetermined ending.

The problem is, there was no explanation, no reasoning, no backstory, no payoff. Just a descent into nonsensical chaos, as if the mayhem was a sort of punchline to a joke.

Initially, it played like a mystery/thriller, hinting at depth as the plot unfolded. But once the same events were repeated from different characters' points of view, it became clear that the story lacked substance. It felt more like a gimmick than a genuine narrative. With nowhere left to go and no real story being told, everything became window dressing for the film's true agenda: ending in an orgy of violence and gore.

It's as if the writer/director started with a cool concept -- a shocking ending involving a grandmother being torn apart by zombie-like children -- and then tried to work backwards from there, to build a story around it. Unfortunately, a worthwhile story never quite materialized.

To be fair, the mayhem was visually striking. But it wasn't enough to justify the 80 minutes spent on a plot that felt like an afterthought. In hindsight, that becomes painfully obvious.",literal
"Despite the final season, Game of Thrones remains an all time classic As we prepare for the House of the Dragon, we look back on the brilliance that once was Game of Thrones. Seasons 1-6 are truly outstanding television, right up there with The Sopranos, Breaking Bad, Mad Men, The Wire, best of the best. Season 7 was a drop in quality but still somewhat enjoyable, and then came Season 8 which was a blunder of epic proportions. A Rushed, botched, lazy ending and a slap in the face to both new and old fans alike.

That being said, nothing can take away from the wild, brilliant, emotional ride that is Game of Thrones seasons 1-6, a television show that defined a decade and changed pop culture forever. I like to believe that it was cancelled after Season 6 and we never get to see the true ending ;)",literal
"A very good sequel In a era where a lot of sequels are made, to give that ""blast from the past"" to new generations, this one is a really good one - not made just for the sake of one. They nailed it.

"honestly.. At first it seemed extremely strange and I didnt really like it, but I kept watching just cause it helped pass time. It isnt the greatest, but when it came to the last episode it was amazing, I would really love to see more of angel dust's trauma and real personality, more of him and who he is instead of just a lot of sexual jokes all the time yknow? I get it its what he does but it just seems a bit overused in my opinon, I would really love more from him!! Alastor as well, I really like his character since he's extremely interesting especially his creepy sides(eating fresh deer etc) and I would love to see him more just being himself instead of out and about, more intrusion on his personal life!(joke) but so far I would love to see more from it, more like the last episode since that one was really great. Even made me cry! Poor angel baby. Speaking as a gay man, would love to see more from him.",literal
One of the best Disney movies in recent years. The movie is still one of the best modern Disney movies. Its a real pleasure to watch with the kids.

"Tension And Hilarity Overtakes The Drama In PTA's Great Action Thriller I was honestly pleasantly surprised by One Battle After Another. It's one of those films that presents itself as one genre before the film releases, but you definitely get more out of it in terms of what kind of film it is. It's an hilarious thrill ride that sort of overtakes the drama by giving us silly characters and scenarios that are absolutely effective in the storytelling. Paul Thomas Anderson certainly does an exceptional job directing this one and his ambition with the project looked very high coming from the picture. For me, the acting was truly one of the best aspects of the film. The acting, particularly from our main talents, are responsible for that inclusion of balance between the comedy and the drama. There are multiple times in which you'll find out that some of the characters are just completely dumb and it's just a lot of fun. The cinematography is actually interesting because of the use of VistaVision. I thought the picture looked absolutely great with it, especially during the climax. Jonny Greenwood's music is fantastic, the editing is super clean, and the adapted screenplay by PTA is absolutely consistent. One Battle After Another is surely a great film to see on the big screen and I highly recommend it. I also wouldn't be surprised at all if it was nominated for one of the best films of 2025. It's that entertaining.",literal
Terrible! I kept watching this movie in the hopes that it would get better.. it didn't. She spends the whole movie cheating on her absolutely perfect and devoted fiancé then leaves him at the alter in the end for the alcoholic bartender that she was cheating with. This was a complete mess and only made me angry at the end of it.,literal

"Fantastic Political Drama What a novel idea to do a series on the Assassination of a President almost no one knows anything about. This is a really well done telling of the assassination of James Garfield, which balances the rise of a quiet, humble Congressman to the Presidency with the story of the assassin himself and his ill gotten attempts to work himself into the Administration. I do not know how much of this is true but it makes great theater. Thea acting is great. Michael Shannon, Bradley Whitford, Matthew Macfadyen, Nick Offerman,and the amazing Betty Gilpin. The back door, back stabbing is riveting and funny and enlightening in light of today's governmental mess. Watch this.",literal
"Halfway through episode three and I waved the white flag. I've always loved period dramas and went into this series with high expectations, only to be thoroughly let down. Performances feel awkward and overdone. The characters come across as caricatures rather than people of their time, adding to that a parade of hard-drinking, brawling Irishmen and the result is crass and tone-deaf. The production falls short on nearly every front. The attempt to modernise the historical setting is particularly awkward, with intrusive contemporary music blasting through key scenes and feeling completely out of place in 18th-century Ireland. The show is a disjointed mess, offering little value even as light entertainment. With its budget and subject matter, this could have been something special, instead it squandered every opportunity. If you're after any substance or historical authenticity, look elsewhere. One star is generous.",literal
"""Merry Christmas, the shitter was full!"" Clark and his wonderful family want to celebrate Christmas at home and he wants to make it as perfect as possible but there is one disaster coming after the other! This is one of the comedy Christmas classics. With a great cast and many jokes.

Actually, the humor is not always my thing. I am not a big fan of slapstick comedy. Animals being hurt just makes me cringe and I need a bit more to laugh but people falling or a table break down. But it still has some good moments.

One thin that bothered me the most was the lack of participation by most family members. It is such a great cast but we don't see much of them besides Chevy Chase and Randy Quaid (and both were great). I was excited to see Doris Roberts, but she basically got nothing to say or do, I felt it was such a waste.

As usual when watching older movies it was fun to see actors I know in their earlier roles. One would be Johnny Galecki whom I wouldn't recognize if I wouldn't see his name.

I am probably more generous to this movie than I should be. If it wasn't a Christmas movie it would probably get a 6 from me, but it is just a part of the Holiday season that is worth watching. It has the usual ""family is more important on Christmas than anything else"" message, and I rather get it from this movie than It's a Wonderful life.",literal
"Excellent Show I have not laughed out loud at a show in years.

This is very funny, but then it gets a little real.

Hats off to the writers as some of the stuff Powell says under his breath is hysterical.

Yes it is silly and unbelievable but so is all of comedy.

All of the Actors fill their rolls, looking forward to season 2.",literal
"Grown up Dr. Carter and it hits the feels I usually avoid hospital type shows because they can get so repetitive in their plots and truly I was all about ER when it first aired and it's hard to beat that one. So I started watching cuz Noah Wyle is in it and it was interesting enough premise . I was hooked from hour one. He may have a different name on the show and it's a different city but this is grown up Dr. Carter who is now in charge of his own ER and he does that role justice. He is great - the right reactions at the right moment. The acting was genuine and with as many years as he has spent in these shows I believe he can save a life. He gives the most emotional moments in an emotional show so I hope he is recognized for it - he was worth the watch.

I love most of the other characters except for the arrogant student doctor Santos - it was annoying to watch her be rude, condescending and cocky and yet keep getting ahead. It was her fist day in that ER and I was over her in hour one and she just got worse and they kept letting her get away with it. She made so many bad calls and she kept landing on top. They need to take her down a few notches - she was very unpleasant to watch. I binged the show over a few days so I got all the feelings at once and overall I could have done without the need to make the female doctors be so vindictive with very little substance and they crossed so many ethics to make their point. It was a bit too pushy. They could have the same points without being so unethical themselves. There is an example of them thinking a father, who is in critical condition, they believe was molesting his daughter . There was a whole scene where Dr. Santos handles it by threatening the patient in her care, like threatens with bodily harm in an ER he went for treatment. Like there was another way to make the point that the man was terrible without the doctors being unethical. Most of what she did could have been done better if they hadn't been trying to be so dramatic about her behavior. The student doctors were just a bit too dramatic in all their reactions but it was day one so I guess it works but they can't stay that unethical and clueless in the next season.

Noah is the standout for sure .",literal
"The Old King is still the best King I'll admit, when I first heard about the Tulsa King my immediate thought was that it would be a weak cousin of the Sopranos, or some woke take on the world of the mafia.

But was I wrong. This show slowly but gradually grows on you right from the first episode, and as it continues it only gets better.

This role fits Sylvester Stallone like a glove, and Sly is really showing that he should've been doing TV series earlier in his career, because he for sure is carrying this show all by himself. There are other characters for sure that also interesting, but none carries himself like Stallone does. And Stallone is bringing his A+ game on every episode, even going to the point of proving he can be very emotional and believable while doing it.

The shows knows when to be serious, funny, dark, and hopeful. Even when Sly addresses the current problem of wokeness, he does so logically explaining exactly how the current Gen Z has no idea what the previous generations had to go through. His character doesn't insult in any way those that are woke, he just asks the very reasonable question of when will enough be enough.

I for one am loving Tulsa King, and I strongly recommend it to anyone that just wants to watch a great show, without any politics, wokeness, allowing the viewer to just relax and have a good time.",literal
"Top tier show, especially the acting! Another brilliant Ryan Murphy production . This is my first comment cause I loved this show. It feels i didnt see the same show as other critics . From what i read , they did not reach episode 5 . I feel the show shows all the sides of the characters, and episode 5 is just so well played... amazing job by actors . This show is rich and indeed can be stereotyped at the beginning but gets better and better with episodes. Things I loved in this show is: amazing acting , filming , music and showing of ""both sides"" -- and letting the audience decide who the monsters are in this tragedy. Totally recommend.",literal
Maggot pierth ruins it. I literally have to fast forward through EVERY scene including Maggie.,literal
"Underdeveloped Not groundbreaking in any way, but it does strike a nice balance. Never taking itself too seriously while still keeping the stakes high enough to keep you invested in what happens next. That said, it feels underdeveloped in both story and characters, there's something missing that would make you truly care about what happens to them.

The choice to revisit the past days of each character comes across less like a meaningful narrative device and more like a patch for an undercooked plot. It doesn't add much and only delays the story's momentum.

While the premise is fun and initially intriguing, it ultimately lacks the complexity and character depth needed to leave a lasting impact.",literal
"Quirky but never truly funny Cathy Jamison (Laura Linney) has cancer and she wants to change her life. She's not sure how. She and childish Paul (Oliver Platt) have a problem marriage. Her brother Sean Tolkey (John Benjamin Hickey) is deliberately poor. Her son Adam (Gabriel Basso) is a bratty teenager. She has a tough time telling everybody. She's not a particularly good teacher and Andrea Jackson (Gabourey Sidibe) is her smart-mouthed student. Marlene (Phyllis Somerville) is her pain in the ass neighbor until she becomes her most profound friend.

This show tries very hard to be quirky but it never really achieves full comedy. I like Laura Linney and Oliver Platt. I also love the storage locker with all the birthday presents. The show fades a bit after the end of season two. It seems to take the show one way but season 3 took it all back when it opened. The show deals with death all the time but it seems it lost its nerve. I do like the final 4 episode wrap up.",literal
"Nobody 2 So it's same as the first one but with more brutal action I would say , to be honest same story like it did it before , someway in the 2nd act it's feels littile bit of slow but somehow climax hold it .

Movie run time is good it's short and holding the vibe slightly .. and charachters bonding doesn't feel so relestic someway But I like the chemistry of bob and connie so yup it was nice .... Again overall it's a good brutally action movie what I want and some scenes just stuck on your mind so yup go for it , it would be good time .....",literal
"Courage to Change the Tone The Big C begins as a sharp dramedy and grows into something deeper and more sincere.

At some point it takes a brave turn - leaving behind easy irony to face life with quiet honesty and balance.

Only a truly grounded series can risk such a change of tone and remain coherent.

Laura Linney delivers her role with elegance and restraint, and the writing keeps its dignity all the way through.

A rare and mature piece of television that reminds us how good storytelling can still surprise.",literal
"Well That Hit The Spot! The first thing I noticed while watching The Running Man and the first thing I wrote down in my notebook was ""this is unbelievably retro"", which is funny because it's supposed to take place in the year we're in, 2019. It's also a fascinating concept that is ripe for a remake if handled right tonally. Most of Arnold's films are cheesy, but rarely do they display the kind of cheese that we get after every one of Arnolds kills. Everything from ""That hit the spot"" to ""He had to split"" is used to describe people dying in a bullseye and splitting someone in half. You get the message after the first one that this isn't exactly a serious movie. So if you take it like that, there's a whole lot to be enjoyed here. And aside from that ridiculous underground rebel group, it's pretty clever too. Oh, and it's also incredibly influential once you realize just how many movies used the same sort of post-apocalyptic ideas.

7.8/10",figurative
"Has potential Watched most of the first season, seems very good, Jeffrey deaver writes great books, my own issue with this show is it could be a bit more gritty the storylines itself and the premise is good, the extra grit would help with the storylines I would like them to emphasize more about his tracking skills! Make it sound a bit more specialized the storyline with his brother could be good has and undercurrent feel of the unit! I like the show. But I have to say they just don't make TV like they used to! The unit the wire the sopranos the shield, need to back off the PG era and they need to bring in swearing I know it's not for everyone but it's more realistic for these kinds of jobs! Good premise though, solid enough! Stay away from real life agendas TV series are supposed to be an escape!",literal
"That's it? 1) I love horror movies.

2) I avoided all trailers, marketing and reviews, so I am not a victim of overhyping.

3) I felt like this would be another example of a movie that will be unanimously praised and lauded as the best/scariest horror movie of the year. That seems to be the case.

4) Six stars is a positive score, but this review will be mostly negative as I try to explain why I didn't like this more.

5) The mystery is built masterfully. But once we find out who or what is behind the horror, all I could think is, ""That's it?"" I hoped there was more to the story or somewhere interesting the plot could go from there. But there really isn't.

6) They keep telling us more about the flawed characters, and have them involved in drama, which I enjoyed as it happened. But it doesn't come into play even a tiny bit, not with the story or any character arcs.

7) There are some really good horror elements and jaw-dropping moments. But I ask myself if I would watch this again, and the answer is... probably not.

8) It's a good movie, but I can't help but feel underwhelmed.

"Hard to bash after one episode. Strange to see people run to their phones and light up a series after one episode, or in some cases didnt even watch the entire episode.

That's negligence on their part. If you dont like it, move on or ""stay til the end"" then the review seems more comprehensive as well as more subjective.

Back to it. The show is essentially, or appears to be out of the gate, almost the same exact premise as Apple TV's Dope Thief, which was thoroughly enjoyed in this house. Is that good or bad? Well, could be bad on one hand, as Dope Thief was very well done. Is this? Not sure yet, the the similarities hopefully stops there, moving forward. Seems slower developing and a bit more plodding, but not fair to review based on a sampling of one episode. Will edit moving forward.

EDIT: and back to it heading into what should be a solid finale. Again, the Dope Thief comparison was.on play after viewing the first episode. I came to see what the response was after it aired and was shocked by the people that jumped in to say it sucked and shut it off, or the ""pacing"" didnt meet their approval. This was the only reason I countered with my own take. Stating that the similarities seemed there, but thats where they end to be honest.

Unless the wheels come off next week in the episode 7 this has been a hell of a triumph for what I thought was going to be another yawnfest. Great writing, direction and memorable performances throughout.

Wraps up next week and cant wait to see where the undermining within, and the antagonists end up. Near perfection, and also to be honest, didnt like the directors previous series as it spun its tires for too long to stay engaged.",literal
"Embarrassingly awful If this movie is actually the blockbuster that the media claims it is, I am shocked. This is one of the worst big-budget films I've ever seen, it is depressing to think of how much money was wasted on producing this garbage. The CGI dinosaurs look like PS4 cutscenes and are less convincing than the dinosaurs in the original Jurassic Park, which came out 32 years ago! I know this is a cliche, but I genuinely felt like the script was written by AI. Scenes sort of just happen, with nothing connecting them together. It's all just empty, soulless action with zero character development. Is it even possible to care about these characters? Somehow a family just happens to be on a boat in the middle of the ocean (???), they get attacked, and suddenly they are a part of the main cast. We'd not even gotten to know the mercenary characters, and now these random people are sloppily dumped into the story. There are pathetic attempts at comic relief (WEED IS SO FUNNY, HAHA) at completely inappropriate moments. For some reason the little girl gets a pet dinosaur because, why not? There are gigantic titanosauruses in a field that somehow are invisible when they lie down in grass. This movie is awful and I am convinced that most of the good reviews are coming from bots because I refuse to believe anyone actually ""loved"" this movie.",literal
"Oh Britta's in this? Ryan Murphy needs to stop trying to make Fetch happen. I'll never understand why the likes of Ryan Murphy gets to keep having their shows made when there are so many talented writers out there with amazing stories to tell.

Wow! That certainly was misleading It is an insipid soap opera drama.

There is the ex wife that is the boss.

Team member drama. Twins with one brother taking the other's girl but still working together, generally stupid plot. Dramatic music the same as every other soap opera mind numbing show, etc etc.

I watched maybe half of it? Probably less before I couldn't take it anymore.

Good Lord it was awful 1 star because I couldn't rate it lower.",literal
"Elegant production, acting and scenery You have to read the disclaimer at the start of each episode indicating that this is a 'fictionalized"" account of the Guinness history...than enjoy the show.

Opulent sets and AI reflect the massive wealth of the family and the street scenes are equally well-done.

For entertainment to serve its purpose it should be done correctly as promised, feature a disclaimer if it is not historically accurate and have enough value to make viewers want to see the next chapter in the series. I believe this meets all that criteria but dropped a star rating by using an ill-considered ending to the series.",literal
"Had me snoring This is really boring, most of it anyway. I only liked two episodes, not that much though. The rest were either bad or awful. For starters the animation looks purposefully terrible. That is lazy, not artistic. The two episodes I somewhat liked were Dezmonds big day out and Who violently murdered Simon s. Salty. They werent even that funny either. Just more than the rest.

The shows humor is really lazy. Random/gross doesnt equal funny, guys. Not a single joke in any of the first eight episodes had any build up or backstory to them.

I don't know why this show is so beloved. I guess this might be good if you're like, taking a snooze or something.",literal
"BEST FRANKENSTEIN FILM!!! LFF Entry #3

A superb, dark, and genuinely frightening horror film - especially for a Frankenstein adaptation. This might actually be my favourite take on the story (though I'll admit, I haven't seen all of the previous versions, just a few, which were fine).

This one, however, is absolutely stunning to look at from the cinematography to the colour grading, it's probably the most beautiful Frankenstein film ever made. The storytelling is really well done and keeps you fully engaged (which is impressive for a movie that runs over two hours!) The craftsmanship here is incredible, though that's no surprise when Del Toro is in his element.

The characters are all great and play their parts to the fullest. The action sequences go all out and never hold back, they're awesome to watch. I also loved the monster's design; it looked like a mix between Tom Cruise from Interview with the Vampire and Brandon Lee's The Crow, blended with a creepy, disturbing twist. Absolutely loved it.

Definitely recommended!",literal
"Great show worth watching! I'm quite enjoying the show! I like that it's a medical drama that's not overly soap opera! The actors are well casted, their characters match the relationships that they are portraying are very intriguing! The way the story is unfolding shows how well the show is written!

The amount of emotions that I feel when watching this show makes me think about my reflections of how I've treated people and how I can soften myself. Every story is different and you learn different aspects of each character .....encouraging you to want to watch more! It's nice to see a story that worth watching on TV!

Thank you for a great show, wonderful cast and inspiring storylines. Can't wait to see how Amy's life turns out! Have a great day!",literal
"Grows on you Most recent episode about mammograms was the best yet. Joyce showed more vulnerability. Dr Bruce showed maturity. Alex was her usual thoughtful person. Not wanting to hurt anyone's feelings. The show combines humor with real personal dilemmas. Each character tends to remind me of things I experienced in my own life. I am older so I think Dr Ron is my favorite. I find very few shows that interest and entertain me. St Denis brings both young and old situations into view. If you are considering this show please start from episode 1. It will definitely grow on you. The camera following the characters took some getting use to, but I just overlook the filming aspect.",literal
"Unnecessary Title I enjoyed the first Black Phone so I was excited to see this one but I wasn't expecting the route that they went with the story. I grew up on 80's horror movies so to see them ""sample"" The Nightmare on Elm Street was quite disappointing. As a standalone movie and not a sequel to the original Black Phone this would've been fine but there was no real connection to the original movie. I think they would've been better off focusing on the origin story instead of the route they went.",literal
"Brilliantly innovative and sumptuous Having read some of the reviews on here, I was fully expecting this show to be a complete dud, but decided to give it a try due to the awards it has picked up.

How wrong I was, I think both seasons have been fantastic, I love how all the characters have their flaws exposed. Normally filmmakers and individuals try to cover those flaws or minimise them, but here they are laid out to be be feasted on by the audience. We all know that no one leads a 100% perfect life, and here we have primarily tourists, although some staff and locals too, exposing their thoughts and acts out to us.

In addition to the brilliant characterisations , we have sumptuous locations in both seasons that all add to the bacchanalian feast. I love how both seasons build up to a crescendo where I get the sense of characters just feasting and gorging on each other until it's just all too much. I can't wait for S2 episode 7 to drop at the weekend to find out more. I'm recommending this show to everyone I know, as long as they're ok with nudity etc.

Love it !",literal
"Once in a generation show Regardless of how you feel about the most recent seasons, there is no denying the excellence of the first several seasons of the series before it had to write out characters in order to keep the show going. First 6 or so seasons A+ and def worth watching. There is no way you can't become attached to these characters and their stories. The fact that it's gone on for so long is just an astonishing feat rarely seen in television and should be appreciated - not trashed - because of it. How many other shows are still making 24 episodes a season?? Hardly any. So love the show for what it is and appreciate it while it's still around.",literal
"Ridiculously unrealistic show on TV I like some of the actors but am disappointed in their choice to be on this show. Either the show has no advisors or they choose not to listen to them. Tactics, procedures even dialogue is horribly inaccurate. Booo!",literal
"Less of an action film and more of a bland, road-trip style drama My love for Liam Neeson knows no bounds - no matter how many mediocre movies he stars in, I will always watch the next one, in hopes that maybe my expectations will be subverted and I will be treated to a good film. Unfortunately, in the last few years, Mr. Neeson has starred in a string of mediocre movies. ""Taken 3"" is bad beyond description, mainly due to its atrocious editing style. ""Cold Pursuit"" attempted to go the dark comedy route, and in my opinion, missed its mark. ""Honest Thief"" was painfully banal, filled with stilted acting and a noticeable lack of action. And now we have ""The Marksman,"" another entry in the mediocre Liam Neeson movie genre.

""The Marksman"" is less of an action thriller and more of a drama, and that's not inherently bad. However, the movie boasts an astounding lack of suspense and tension throughout, plodding along from scene to scene until the inevitable final confrontation - which to the film's credit, is exciting. However, before you have the pleasure of watching that, you have to sit through a long, slow, road-trip style adventure, that lacks any type of thrill. Sure, you'll find one or two intermittent ""action"" scenes during the course of the movie, but these scenes barely contain any worthwhile action. There is a poorly filmed fistfight that lasts about 10 seconds, as well as a mild getaway type of scenario that our hero has to escape from, and that's about it.

Because of its lack of action, the main draw of ""The Marksman"" is its actors, namely Liam Neeson and Jacob Perez. Liam Neeson is good with what the script has him do, and I enjoyed his character. A previous member of the Marine Corp, Liam's character, Jim, struggles with alcohol, and is unapologetically atheist, which I found interesting for a character in a mainstream film. While I was originally opposed to watching a movie with a child actor in it, because of how bad child actors usually are, Jacob Perez was, to my surprise, pretty good. He could pull off emotion when he needed to, but mostly he was likeable, and it was enjoyable to watch him and Liam interact. There was some good comedy throughout, and some interesting conversations between the two characters, but that leads me into some more negatives.

Unfortunately, for a movie that is so dialogue heavy, a lot of the dialogue was very boring. There were so many opportunities for the characters to argue or engage in a verbal battle because of their own respective beliefs and morals, but the script took the easy way out it seems, instead employing a large use of exposition. Additionally, for a movie that takes place on the road, it doesn't look very good. The cinematography and directing is very basic, almost as if this was originally a made for television film that at the last minute the studios decided to release in theatres.

When the action starts, it is exciting, specifically the battle at the end. Liam pulls off some badass moves, and he puts his rifle to work. However, at this point the movie was too little, too late, and I was so disengaged that I was more looking forward for it to end. In case it wasn't clear - I still love Liam Neeson, and I'll never stop watching his movies. However, at the end of ""The Marksman,"" I almost found myself asking if I should even bother anymore.",figurative

The cinematography of the wilderness and the way the light is shaped through its endless majesty is so gorgeous you'll think Colin Farrell will show up any second to clash with Powhatan Natives over Jewel's cousin, or Chris Farley will get in a slapping match with a demented chieftain. It's that lovely, Malickesque in its splendor. A true visionary masterpiece. Amen.",figurative
"Mixed feelings on this. The cinematography was amazing. Capturing the filth of the city of Dublin. The cast did their mighty best with the script which could have been so much better.

Being Irish, I could nitpick away at the idioms, misplaced. For example the expletive ""feck"" was used in those days and still is and not the other one with the u. Feck also meant to steal so blasphemy was covered.

The music was an intrusion and not of the era which continually yanked me out of the story as it was not relevant as to what was going on.

Modern Irish was used also, even in the written which was jarring so I assume through research was not done.

Costumes were glorious and factory scenes were riveting.

However, the ending left a lot to be desired for this huge investment of time. And it must have cost a fortune to produce. A shame.

"Pretty Good Sitcom The Big Bang Theory is one of the more popular comedies of all-time! Every character on the show is almost as equally funny as the others, everyone has their favorites but all are funny. The show keeps it focus on the core four characters and their significant others. You really end up caring about what happens to these hilarious characters. Whether you like this show or not there's no denying that it's obviously one of the most popular sitcoms of all-time, all you have to do is look at the ratings, how much the cast was paid and considering it's on all the time. While I wouldn't exactly put it among my favorite comedies of all time, I would say that it still a pretty fun show. You know the show is popular that when it was ending it felt like it was an end to an era.",literal

"Stupid as every super spy movie. Fun as every super spy movie. *sigh* So, there we have a new breed of super agent. Beefed-up wise guy with anarchistic tendencies. That's who Xander Cage (Diesel) is - and hell, I like characters like that. First: we have an insane terrorist threatening the world with a prototype WMD. Overdone to death. And that organization name... ""Anarchy 99"" - who the heck invented this one?! I understand that Rob Cohen was on that anti-globalist hype and bearded guys in woodland cameo don't necessarily sell well, but anarchy has no sense whatsoever. Second: we have spy gadgets - not too little, not too much. The GTO is somewhat a pastiche or parody of ""super spy car"" - and that's planned. Three: we have evident mistakes, ie. Prague is shown being close to snowy mountains and and a medieval castle while in fact it's not - not counting the second motorbike escape scene it could be fixed with adding some travel scenes. Four: not all characters are played on equal level. Yes, you can fall in love with Asia Argento (I did ;) ), Samuel L. Jackson as Gibbons is nice to watch and Vin Diesel as the ""tough-cookie smart-ass"" is okay too, but Marton Csokas as Yorgi is terribly cheesy. I don't know if he was told to act like a mad villain from 60's movies or did he screw it all up himself, but he's irritating.

To be honest: it IS stupid, but which super spy movie isn't? I think only ""The World Is Not Enough"" tried to be quasi-realistic, but this is a matter for another discussion. Anyway, XXX is stupid and that's why it's fun to watch. Because you know it's not serious.

"This is Really Good I'm a hard-to-please guy. I have to be able to buy into characters, the plot has to make sense and the scenery/locations have to be genuine.

This hits all marks, with the possible exception of Jagger croaking the theme song. I always fast forward through that.

It's based on a series of novels about the British intelligence service, and a London field office where a few ""failures"" are banished to. They are just minor screw-ups, though. If they did something major they would by kicked out of MI5.

Anyway, it's easy for me to buy into everything. The writing is great, the actors are great, the plots make sense...

What can I say? Somebody found some really well-written novels by an author who knew what he was doing, and they successfully translated them into a series of 6-episode seasons.

It works for me. Just the right blend of comedy, drama, mystery, action and story-telling.

And because the seasons are fairly short, it doesn't take a lot of time to make new ones. Three seasons in two years, and two more are projected. So, that's nice too.",literal

I consider myself a true fan of the show, someone who was there since the beginning, all the way back in 2005, I truly loved this show & the family dynamic woven thoughout the early seasons with a compelling over arching story & characters who weren't at this time parodies of themselves,

The show unarguably peaked in season 5 with the finale Swan Song, being a fitting send off for the characters we have spent 5 years with. Then season 6 came along, Admittedly I still watched & partially enjoyed season 6 but found myself thinking, How do you top throwing down with the Devil himself? That was easy you don't. That was one of the major problems with the show, You can't get a bigger big bad then Lucifer. One of the problems, more on that later.

The other major problems is mortality of the characters (Or immortality I should say) There is no feeling or need to worry about the characters safety or death, as ALL of the central cast have died & came back so many times its been played out so many times that ""death"" the biggest threat for any shows character is now a minor inconvenience rather than a fate. Back in the days of season 2 I remember how shocked & upset I was when Sam was mortally wounded in the penultimate episode of season 2, Season 3 should have been a sign when Dean was killed repeatedly in a throw away but hilarious episode Mystery Spot. Cut to Season 7 because I don't want to carry on with this rant I know the main characters have died & come back throughout those seasons, but another major character supposedly dies & this seemed legit. Shocking? Yes! Sad? A little! Should I have been? No because he came back (As a ghost that same damned season)

That is one of the biggest problems with the show when death is used as a plot device rather than a threat it takes away from the characters, when they're in peril its just a set back to be killed on this show when you got an angel in your back pocket.

Enough about that lets start on the biggest problem with the show. Toxic fans! You know who I am talking about? You're typical basement dweller who spends their time on message boards & forums whining about who their ""favourite"" character should be with, I saw a comic-con awhile back on YouTube where Jenson Ackles is visibly angry with these parasites & shook my head thinking. Your why I don't bother this show anymore. I legit despise these kind of fans as they have played a major part in ruining this shows credibility too, with their entitlement, Back in the day a fan watches a show & either enjoys it or doesn't with Supernatural they can b#tch & moan until they get their way. like a child stomping their feet, this behavior is rewarded with Supernatural for years now as fans have basically become glorified writers for the show with their slash fic fantasies played out on the small screen.

I haven't bothered with the show for a few years now as I have stated above but I did witness them bringing back old villains most notably Lucifer as they retread old ground, I do have a friend who still watches the show while even she admits its quality has diminished she still insists I give it another shot.

I very nearly did until she told me who the big bad was the final season. God himself. I nearly fell down laughing, asking Chuck??? A hack writer is the ""big bad""? I rolled my eyes when I came across some fan going crazy about how amazing & foreshadowed Chuck being evil was. No it was not. it wasn't even remotely hinted at. Its just a desperate move by writers who have written themselves into a corner so they insist ""Oh this guy's the biggest threat evers"" Sigh this is exhausting & sad at the same time as I said this show was once great & ended fittingly in season 5. It was almost the perfect finale & one of the best I personally had ever seen. Now if I was to watch this season i can say without the shadow of a doubt it WILL NOT have the same impact as it did 10 years ago. Diminishing returns play a part in finales too look at Lost for example. The finale won't end with a bang, nor a whimper. It'll be a fart on the breeze & that is truly sad.",literal
"Trying to like it because of the scenery Like the sheriff. But not the daughters. And this season there are two! The deputies also not so much. Not looking forward to another star crossed same sex entanglement. And the deputy with the alcoholic daughter is a distraction.

Cassandra is not likeable. Too big of an ego due to her being elected to the town council? Are you kidding me? Mmmm why am I watching this?",literal
"The epitome of the 1950s melodrama. ""Magnificent Obsession"" is one of those movies that I have known about since I was small, but only now have gotten around to seeing it. For me it was most interesting for the actors. Jane Wyman was near 40, with many movies behind her, and only a few ahead. She plays Helen Phillips, who loses her husband tragically. 

Rock Hudson was still in his 20s, and an established young star. He plays Bob Merrick, who we see is a rich, spoiled guy used to getting what he wants. His outlook changes when he meets Helen and falls in love with her. But Helen finds him crass, and knows that her husband was dead because Merrick had been in a foolish boating accident which tied up the equipment which could have saved her husband. So, the movie is about her struggles, while Merrick tries to get her to care for him. Highly melodramatic, but a good example of the genre. Two years later Wyman and Hudson would make ""All That Heaven Allows"" together.

SPOILERS. As Helen gets out of a cab on the traffic side, to get away from Merrick's advances, she is hit and injured, and becomes blind as a result. She learns to cope as a blind woman when doctors tell her they can't do anything, but Merrick insinuates himself back into her life, posing as ""Robbie"" Robinson. He decides that to make amends he must go back to medical school, and as his mentor says, becoming a doctor will be a ""magnificent obsession"", thus the title of the movie. Eventually as Helen seems to be drifting away, he is forced to perform emergency surgery, the movie ends with him in her arms, in the hospital bed, she can see him.",literal
"Quality production. First class writing, acting, production.

Colleen Attwood on top form as usual with her costumery.

Jenna Ortega perfectly cast.

Story a little transparent, but it doesn't really matter.

I have some reservations - Gomez and Morticia are appallingly badly cast - fortunately, they aren't in it much.

Lurch doesn't have a single word of dialogue - why this departure from the story?

Wednesday is perfectly set to start with - heavily shadowed makeup, hard black lipstick etc, but as the episodes progress, both her appearance and demeanour are softened, which leads her character to lose some credibility.

Shame, as I found it a distraction.

Ultimately a show for the Riverdale generation - it ends up lacking bite.",literal
"Great Dystopian Film I had wanted to see this movie for a long time, but had a hard time getting my hands on it. After watching it I wasn't disappointed. I love the dystopian films from the 80's and 90's and this one defiantly checks all the boxes. When the movie first came out it wasn't a big hit, but I think with the way the world is now it's more relatable. In the film the world has become a communist controlling the people with police/military, with everything censored and strict rules. The people are starving but forced to follow what the government wants. A game show is created to distract the public and keep them calm. A show where people kill criminals. Arnold is great as always, showing off his strength and giving cheesy lines. He's the unstoppable man. The story was well put together and held my attention with ease. Really enjoyed it and could easily watch again.",literal
Always gave thrills This show I followed every since I first saw an episode I fell straight into it like a pool. These guys and their cast throughout seasons were so perfect I just applaud all involved you all should know we love what you did. The Winchester's and Supernatural took me on a ride with them for years and I will always rewatch the seasons as I e owned it for years.,literal
"Stop the show I love greys anatomy and it's one of my favorite shows, but please don't try to lengthen it more or you are going to ruin it. All the characters are either leaving or dying so please only make an amazing finale so everyone remember how good the first seasons were.",literal
"Doesn't do it for me There's absolutely nothing wrong with this show, it's pretty decent on all counts. I couldn't fault it, except for the fact that it doesn't do anything for me. I could just watch it out of boredom or lack of any better ideas. The actors are decent, the writing is decent, it's somewhat novel I suppose, it's just not funny at all, at least to me and it doesn't engage me at all on an emotional level so what is the point of forcing myself to watch it?

It has all the ingredients, but maybe it's supposed to be dry humour, but I love dry humour, so why isn't it giving me that?

Watched a couple of episodes and I'm done.",literal
"Two hours of nothing Honestly, I don't know if I watched the same film everyone else is raving about, but I'm pretty sure my brain was left waiting in the lobby the entire time. The movie is long. Too long, too slow, too... boring. And yet, somehow, it still manages to feel overstuffed. Imagine a film that wants to be edgy, intense, and dramatic, but instead just flatlines.

The multiple points of view were supposed to add depth or suspense, I guess, but instead they just fragmented the story and made it even harder to care about any of the characters. It felt like a patchwork of perspectives that didn't really go anywhere, leaving me more bored than invested.

I waited the whole movie for something to happen... and nothing happened.

Sure, it's original, I guess, but by the end, I wasn't scared, I wasn't impressed - I was just relieved it was over.",literal
"Great first 2 seasons Captivating and sweeping historical drama series set in 18th-century Cornwall, England.

Aidan Turner portrays Ross Poldark, a complex and charismatic protagonist who returns home from the American Revolutionary War to find his life and estate in disarray. Turner's performance brings depth and emotion to the character, making Ross Poldark a compelling and multi-dimensional figure.

Poldark's stunning cinematography and picturesque landscapes transport viewers to the rugged and breathtaking Cornish countryside. The show's attention to historical detail and period costumes adds authenticity to the setting, immersing audiences in the world of 18th-century England.

The series is enriched by a talented ensemble cast, with standout performances from Eleanor Tomlinson as Demelza, Heida Reed as Elizabeth, and Jack Farthing as the formidable George Warleggan. Their interactions and conflicts drive the narrative, creating a tapestry of complex relationships and emotional drama.

Poldark's narrative is rich with themes of love, family, loyalty, and societal change, making it more than just a historical romance. The show adeptly weaves personal struggles with larger societal issues of class divides and economic challenges.

The character development throughout the series is masterfully handled, as we see the evolution of characters and their relationships over time. This gradual growth adds depth and investment in their journeys.

While some may argue that the pacing in certain seasons can be slow, the slower moments serve to build tension and emotional depth, culminating in satisfying payoffs.

In conclusion, Poldark is a captivating and emotionally resonant historical drama that immerses viewers in the lives of its richly drawn characters. With its beautiful visuals, compelling performances, and engrossing narrative, it's a series that keeps audiences eagerly invested in the lives and fates of the Poldark family.

If you're a fan of historical dramas that blend romance, intrigue, and societal issues, Poldark is a must-watch. So, step into the world of Cornwall and experience the epic journey of love, loss, and resilience that defines the extraordinary saga of Poldark.",figurative
"NCIS is overdone - move on! The original WAS the original - leave it be. This looked more like a copycat version of the ""Reacher"" series, than a prequel of NCIS. Really, we all had enough of the storyline about Gibb's wife and daughter in the original. This one is so disjointed with all the flashbacks (and commercials).

They should have just extended N. C. I. S.: Los Angeles or New Orleans before starting Hawaii or Origins. Noone can play Gibbs, but Gibbs (Mark Harmon). Since he left the series, the new cast of the original has just not been able to gel together.

My vote on Origins is Pass. I won't be watching the next episode.",literal
"Gold until season 8 It's brilliant until Michael leaves. The show has other great characters but not enough to make 2 more seasons without Michael. One thing that really bothered me was how they changed Andys character in the last season. They tried to make him more like Michael and that was so obvious and didn't work for me. They also made Kevin and Erin more and more dumb. It got to a point where it's just not funny. Nellie didn't do anything either. Quite an annoying character. The 2 new young boys weren't terrible but they also didn't do anything to the show.

Things I did like was seeing a softer side of Dwight and Angela and also Jim and Dwight becoming friends. Also the realness of Jim and Pams relationships ups and downs. Gabe was a great newer character. Too bad he left and I actually liked California.",literal
"Like Dahmer, Netflix just can't help themselves This started off as an incredible miniseries that had me on the edge of my seat. The first episode sets the tone perfectly by luring the viewer into the mind of Dahmer through the experience of a victim. Evan Peters does an incredible job at portraying Dahmer, everything down to voice and mannerism is so well-acted it's borderline creepy.

The show manages to portray the gruesome murders without being overly explicit about it, which in a way only adds to the physical discomfort you get from watching it. Instead of seeing blood you instead get to imagine it, which is way more scary. Combined with being beautifully shot and acted, you feel as if you're almost there seeing the real Dahmer himself hunt down and kill his victims.

Unfortunately the show reaches some sort of blind alley from Episode 7 and forth, when the writers start to take too many liberties with the script. Up until that point the show felt very focused, grounded and straight to the point, but then all of a sudden it becomes a political story about discrimination, police incompetence and racial injustice where the writers hijack the story in order to send a message rooted in today's racial climate as of 2022. I mean, I wouldn't mind watching another show about those things but it felt incredibly forced, especially since Dahmer did not discriminate when it came to the color of his victim's skin - he didn't target black people or minorities, but the last four episodes is all about that which kind of ruins everything that came before. And I hate to break it but it's not just that interesting to watch through 1 hour of the victim's families sitting down talking about how miserable they feel. Most people watch these type of shows because they want to see inside the mind of the serial killer himself.

It also doesn't help that a lot of the stuff in the last four episodes is made up, skewed or deliberately pushed aside in order to fit the ""message"" that the writers wanted to shove down our throats. What a shame. This could've easily been a 10/10 show if it wasn't for the fact that Netflix, just like Dahmer himself, just can't help themselves.",literal
"Am i missing something? The show has a high potential to be something extraordinary but so far it's just not what I've expected it to be

I get it, it's the end of humanity but with a twist so far it's interesting and there's a deeper meaning behind what's happening but it feels like a black mirror episodes, yes it's unique but it's not that special at least for me, I hope it's gets better moving forward I trust Vince so let's wait and see.",literal
"Too much like Game of thrones The parallels story line is uncanny. Except it is a love story and they did season 1 of the show GOT in the first 2 episodes. Without watching anymore episodes i can predict what is going to happen in later episodes. Sean Bean will die before season 1 is over since all the shows he has been in he dies. I also believe the earl huntingdon will also meet his end but not in season 1, they will drag it out for as long as they can. They hired an all star cast. Sean Bean, Lauren McQueen, Connie Nielsen.",literal
"Oz must have been on a Tarkovsky kick ""Keeper"" follows Liz, a young woman who goes with her boyfriend Malcolm for a getaway at his family's secluded country home for a weekend getaway that soon spirals into a short vacation into hell.

This new effort from Oz Perkins in a way sees the director going back to the basics of some of his earlier work, with a stripped-down narrative and a menagerie of ghoulish atmosphere and imagery. Unfortunately, what we get here is a middling experiment that never quite comes together. Make no bones about it; what this film does well is atmosphere, it deserves some credit for that. The woodsy environs and the rustic-modern house make for an effective backdrop for the slowly-seeping terrors that seem to infiltrate both the home as well as Liz's psyche. Surreal visual motifs recur throughout that seem to be pulled straight from an Andrei Tarkovsky film, and they are admittedly striking.

Tatiana Maslany also deserves credit here for her naturalistic, understated, and quite believable performance as a woman who finds herself in seemingly ordinary circumstances that may not be at all what they seem. Her confusion and, eventually, sheer terror are palpable. Unfortunately, this film simply did not work for me, largely due to its clunky conclusion. The screenplay thwacks us over the head with a reveal that is as predictable as it is baffling, and neither the over-the-top Clive Barker-esque visual effects or the social commentary in the finale are enough to salvage the thinly-sketched narrative.

In the end, I came away from this film with a very divided opinion. As a moody chamber piece, it does earn its flowers largely due to its offbeat atmosphere and Maslany's performance as a woman in a strange place experiencing even stranger events. However, the resolution feels largely unearned and, unfortunately, unsatisfying. For me, this was a very mixed bag of spooky funhouse horrors. 5/10.",literal
"Great cast, wasted on a bad script Despite its impressive cast, ""Nuremberg"" never rises above the level of a standard blockbuster. Russell Crowe delivers a charismatic performance as Hermann Göring, capturing both his charm and menace. Rami Malek, as the American psychologist, is equally convincing, if sometimes deliberately irritating. But strong acting alone can't save the film from its shallow storytelling and predictable structure. The final act slips into a clichéd hero narrative, where the psychologist suddenly redeems himself in a scene that feels more tiresome than triumphant. Eventually, the film's attempt at a pointe isn't misguided, but it feels forced.",figurative
"It's alright I deleted my first review, because I wrote it after only seeing the first few episodes. After looking at it, I felt maybe I was a bit too harsh. Now that more of the show has been released, I decided to re-write it.

The casting director and the actors all deserve high praise. Each character looked like their real life counterparts, and each captured the way people around Hampton speak. That said, most of us do not say ""bo"" anywhere near as much as the characters in this show do, but it is one of those Hampton things which adds a nice touch to the believability.

As others have mentioned, the events are not in the correct order. While that is a puzzling choice for the showrunners to make, it is not as egregious as some are making it out to be. Instead I find other bits of fiction to be more problematic. For example, this whole subplot where Randy and Alex have a rivalry to become managing partner of the firm. I've seen nothing that leads any credibility to that claim.

This also goes for the ""Paw'Paw"" and ""Go-Go"" nicknames. The only mention of such a nickname in reality that I am aware of is when Alex made the idiotic decision to take the stand during the murder trial. He claimed then that the family affectionally referred to Paul as ""Paw-Paw"" as some weak attempt to garner sympathy from the jury.

The part that really bothered me with these fictitious bits is the portrayal of Paul as being all upset and broken up about the boat crash. This is as far from the truth as can be. That psycho was laughing about Mallory after the crash. He was a total piece of human garbage both before and after the crash.

And finally I'll address Mandy Matney. It is 100% true that she is the reason this whole case didn't get swept under the proverbial rug. She received a lot of criticism leading up to and during Alex's trial. Many claimed that she inserted herself into the story and that she spent more time whining about the ""good ol' boys"" than she did reporting actual facts. This mini-series will not do her any favors in that regard. Too much of this series was told from her point of view and centered around her own struggles, and that is a disservice to the memories of Mallory, Steven, and Gloria.

**update**

Now that the final episode is out, I want to add that Creighton Waters should sue for how he was portrayed. That was an abysmal performance.

Watch this if you want to get a sense of what happened, but pay close attention to that disclaimer at the start of each episode.",figurative
"HBO for the win! And perfect timing! In lighter news today (it's been a rough 24 hours), this brand new series on HBO Max seems very impressive, intriguing, and immersive (the three big Is of good moviemaking, I think). I've always been impressed with Mark Ruffalo (who skills were sorely overlooked by that Hulk nonsense - although he DID kill the roll!), and he's absolutely in top-form in this show. Mark has the ability to become the ""everyman"" (in other words, YOU) when he works a script, which is put to perfect use here. 23-year-old Emilia Jones (who was an incredible standout in the excellent 2021 movie ""CODA"") was perfectly cast and shines in this role. Very impressive work absorbing her character. Her career is looking very bright. I'm not familiar with Tom Pelphrey but I may have to look into his catalog of work because he's quite convincing and effective, and he played off his supporting crew really well. Add all the good acting to some good atmospheric cinematography and scoring and this one's looking pretty promising.

It remains to be seen (this Sunday) if episode two is as good as the pilot, but based on what I've seen so far this is looking like a fascinating story. I'm sure I'm not alone in saying I sure could use the short escape today, so thanks, HBO.",figurative
"It stumbles back and forth over the path to a good movie... ...however, it never makes it to its destination.

Primarily, the narrative is ambiguous at times when its path should've been more clear.

However, the two lead actors: Johnson and Hoffman, really stepped into their roles with energy and gusto that the weaving and stumbling plot line is covered with their performances.

This movie would've made so much more money if it had stayed inside PG-13 territory and not gone onto the R-rated path.

I get the book is grisly, crude and violent, but the movie was marketed as a dystopian thriller and instead, audiences were served up a pessimistic horror movie.",literal
"Dinosaur-to-humans getting eaten ratio way too low And now...a summer blockbuster film from the ""no one asked for it"" department.

It's hard to believe that the original JURASSIC PARK film brought ''shock and awe"" CGI dinosaurs to the big screen 32 years ago. This Stephen Spielberg blockbuster brought in the age (good and bad) of giant CGI summer films. This led to the inevitable trilogy that were still interesting and fun...but definitely followed the law of diminishing returns.

And then...just when you thought you'd seen the last of the CGI dinosaurs of the Jurassic period, the retro/nostalgic JURASSIC WORLD burst onto the scene in 2015 and brought another trilogy of diminishing returns to the screen. And when the final installment (JURASSIC WORLD: DOMINION) hit the screens with a thud, one could safely assume that we had seen the last of this series.

But...the suits at Universal noticed one thing - over $2.2 billion in Worldwide Box Office for the series.

So...whether we like it or not...we get another installment of ""humans getting eaten by dinosaurs"" - JURASSIC WORLD: REBIRTH where Scarlett Johansson (BLACK WIDOW) leads yet another group of human food onto yet ANOTHER island that INGEN was using for dinosaur genetic manipulation.

This Gareth Edwards (the best Star Wars film, ROGUE ONE) effort has quite a bit going for it...an interesting (enough) premise that is well (and simply) laid out, engaging stars in Johansson, Jonathan Bailey (Fiero in WICKED) and 2x Academy Award winner Mahershala Ali (GREENBOOK) who all earn their paychecks trying to bring some depth to thinly written characters who's main role is to look up in ""shock and awe"" at CGI dinosaurs and CGI that REALLY, REALLY works (for the most part), especially a water attack on a boat.

And...there is a young girl in peril, Audrina Miranda (in what looks to be her Major Film debut) who makes a pet of a young dino that is ""just so cute"", but Edwards knows how to pull back just in time to keep it from getting annoying.

However...this film commits many critical errors:

1). It gives work to the worst actor in the business today, Ed Skrein (MIDWAY), who comes clamoring onto the screen with such a one-note performance that he might as well wear an ""eat me"" sign on his back.

2). Unfortunately, that performance isn't the worst one of the film. Rupert Friend (COMPANION) plays the villain of the piece that does everything but twirl his mustache and tie Johansson to the railroad tracks.

3). The CGI in this film is great...EXCEPT...for a scene towards the end of the film where they either ran out of time, money or interest (probably all 3). My kids can make a better CGI scene on their phones than what was foisted on us at the end.

4). Everyone in this film is WAY TOO PRETTY! The couldn't throw a bone to ""weathered"" character actors like Danny Trejo, Dale Dickey or even good ol' Shea Wigham? Nope. They broke open the Ford Modeling Agency books and said...""if they look good, they probably will taste good to the dinosaurs"".

5). NONE of the main characters are worth rooting for (I'm looking at you Johannson and Bailey), though Ali tries really, really hard to give us some sort of better character than the weakly written character he was given by veteran screenwriter David Koepp (let's go with the Tom Cruise THE MUMMY), while a quartet of the players in the ""B"" story are much more interesting and worth our while. Here's an idea, let's do a film focusing solely on these characters!

And, finally, this film committed the CARDINAL SIN of these types of movies: the dinosaur-to-humans getting eaten ratio is waaaaaay too low!

So, come for some very good dinosaur CGI, but you'll have to wade through all the sins of the film to find the few gems.

"Good Will Hunting meets Castle So this is an adaptation of the original French show, H. I. P., and the first episodes of each are the same crime basically. However, I really enjoy both and love Kaitlin Olson.

The story begins similar to Good Will Hunting. Someone who works at night to clean, sees a problem on a white board, solves it. Then both end up getting recruited in a way.

First episode was equally funny and interesting. The idea that someone has a mind like hers is impressive. It's almost Sherlock Holmes like deductive skills.

I mentioned Castle in the subject because shes working more as a consultant in this show. A character like that usually works in a grey area and the cop they work with has to figure out ways to make it work.

Looking forward to the rest of the season.",literal
"This show has really gone downhill Well, after hanging in there this far into Season 3, I think I'm about done with The Big C after the young couple has decided that Cathy and Paul would be perfect adoptive parents for their baby. You have got to be kidding me -- what a stupid and completely unrealistic plot twist. Besides, I've had enough of seeing those two raise an a-hole of a son . . . why in the world would I want to see them start from scratch with someone else's child. Yeech.

I'm tired of every character in this show -- some I had a hard time tolerating from the start, and others who have become unbearable especially this season. I miss Cynthia Nixon in the roll of her good friend (although her relationship with Cathy's brother was ridiculous), as well as Marlene -- the cranky neighbor lady who they killed off at the end of Season 1.

Don't get me wrong, I am so thankful that Showtime, HBO, and the other cable TV outlets do original programming, because there hasn't been a single show on Network TV that I've liked for many years. That having been said, I think they should be careful about not wearing out their welcome with shows that are ill-conceived or that stay on long after the writing has ceased to be decent. The Big C is already in this category, and I find myself hoping that Cathy's melanoma makes a comeback pretty quickly.",literal
"Jurassic World Rebirth is a old school survival thriller adventure which takes you back to the world of Dinosaurs.. Jurassic World Rebirth is a welcome addition to the one of the most beloved franchise in the Hollywood, being the 7th film it left no stones unturned to provide the audience a great adventure on the big screen this summer but the problem is it did nothing new and felt repetitive and boring at some times..

When the first film hitted the theatres back 3 decades ago in 1993 on the big screen it was an global phenomenon and it took audience to a lost world and amazing place of Dinosaurs on the big screen and everyone was stunned by the awesome visuals and CGI accompanied by beautiful score by John Williams, but these things are old now and don't excite audience anymore so filmmakers updated this series in 2015 with Jurassic World and this time it was more than just the world of Dinosaurs as it has some big plots like cloning, genetic weapons and shady organisations doing conspiracy.. But in 2025 they go back to the old roots of a simple survival thriller which was one of the main themes of these films but this time this is the only thing they're trying to show instead of being something too epic like last trilogy did and i respect filmmakers for this.. But storywise it did nothing new surely there are some new hybrid species and a more dangerous moster dinosaur at the end but it lacked the thrill which keeps audience engaged, i mean audience don't care for characters getting chased and hiding from dinasours anymore.. it is just too repetitive and boring.. Rebirth has some of the most boring characters in the franchise i even don't remember the name of everyone and they were just bland at least last trilogy has the charm of main characters Owen and Claire meanwhile the OT has legendary characters John hammond, Dr Alan grant and Ian Malcom but I'll be surprised if anyone even remembers the name of the characters when this movie ends. Lol We all know Scarlett Johansson and Mahershala Ali is a good actor but they feels wasted by a poor script and a very simple story.. there is also not enough big set pieces and action spectacle to keep audience interested but that's just my opinion and don't get me wrong I'm a big Jurassic fan and re-watched all six films before going for this film to freshen up my memories in the last month and I loved the last trilogy despite what anyone says but the harsh truth is this that this series has ran its course it'll be better for filmmakers to stop here and come back again when they have something new in the future..

Overall i enjoyed some parts of Jurassic World Rebirth on the big screen and hearing John William's iconic score at some parts was really amazing and it looks better in 3d and sounds better with Dolby Atmos sound in the theatre and sound design is one of the most important aspects of this series, just watch the 1993 film and you'll realise how amazing sound effects that film had at that time.. so if you are looking for a family friendly adventure on the big screen this is the movie and kids will love it without any doubt but die hard fans of the series can feel a little bit of disappointment but it is not a bad movie, just the same thing as we've seen before..",literal
"Holy Ship (and I didn't mean 'ship')!!! I don't think I've ever given a television series a 10 before, but this series has earned it. I'm just 30 minutes into the first episode and I am completely blown away with the skill of the author AND the of actors. WOW!

A series starring Gary Oldman and Jack Lowden (not to mention Kristin Scott Thomas) should be good. And it lives up to the hype. The intrigue, pacing, and dialogue all raise the bar for what television can be.

This is not a series that you can watch passively. You MUST pay attention. There's a lot of moving parts. And it's best to pay attention to all of them. SLOW HORSES, the television series is so good, I feel compelled to read the books. And that's saying something!!!

"Intriguing to start with, but now?! Zzzzzzzzz 1st season we kept watching, looking for the clues, trying to put it together, only to find another twist in the plot.

But even in Season 1 by episode 10, it was starting to drag.

Everything slowed down, even the way they were speaking, the loooong silences, the draaaawls.

Season 2 became excruciating, not only in its slowness, but the storylines are now verging on nonsensical.

Seriously and perhaps cynically wondering if Ben Stiller and co. Are just dragging this on to keep them all in employment.

It is boring and annoying.

Should have ended by Season 1 and it would have gone down as a fantastic, intriguing thriller.

But now, Zzzzzzzzz.",literal
"If you can suspend rational thinking, then yes You are a skinny 60+ woman who has worked for the MI5 for decades. One day, you find yourself in a busy café, discovering that two athletic men in there are out to get you. Do you 1) Stay in the safety of the public café and contact your friends in the intelligence service? Or 2) Make your way through the kitchen and back door into a deserted and dimly lit alley?

If 2) then Slow Horses is for you. If you can suspend rational thinking and logic - and enjoy a bit of slapstick thrown in for good measure - Slow Horses delivers.

If 1) and you prefer your plots to make sense and take themselves just a little seriously, you will need to look elsewhere.

It's a shame, really. Oldman delivers. The production delivers. The theme song delivers. But the script and directing just doesn't.

EDIT, Season 4:

I knocked a star off after giving it another shot and watching a couple of episodes of season 4. It's actually gotten even worse.

It's ram-packed with cartoonish directing and ludicrous plot vehicles. Just one example:

Two men fight in a warehouse. Nobody else is around. The good guy is in serious trouble when suddenly, poof, another good one steps into the shot. How did she get there?

Seconds later, with her now also on the floor, good guy number 3 steps into the frame.

Good guy number 4 walks by outside, and sees the fight inside the warehouse. What does he do? He walks on to steal a taxi, of course, and charges it into the warehouse, timing it perfectly so he hits only the bad guy, with good guy 1, 2, and 3 all on the floor to the side.

The script and directing is farcical. And it's still really a shame as the production itself still delivers.",literal
"Great start, but the ending fell FLAT The show was hilarious and started off great. Typical storyline of an entitled superstar athlete and just a horrible human being. Then goes through a personal growth. NOW, again, this was a typical storyline, but it then it just seems they didn't know what to do with the ending. So, no spoilers, but the ending was just disappointing. Not sure this show warrants a season 2.",literal

"Its Speed On Foot Pop quiz hot shot, the horror master Stephen King places 50 young men who volunteer in a dystopian America for a ""long walk"", whilst maintaining a 4 mile per hour speed or face elimination, what do you do?....you immerse yourself in what is no doubt one of the better adaptations of his novels in sometime.

The cleverly scripted walk creates very distinct and divisive character development that will determine your emotional impacts. It is extremely well acted and directed, giving the viewer every opportunity to experience the agony and despair of the young men.

You may have to be in the right mood for this but it looks like Raymond Garraty saw Katniss Everdeen and said hey girl hold my beer. Immerse and Enjoy.",literal

"i like the show not some of content Hello I have been watching the new episodes since the BLM issues have some to light. I find the female african american actress to be not an asset to the show. She plays the ""poor me, Im black"" card way too much and thinks because she is black she should be treated differently than everyone else on the show. The writters need to write her lines like she is just like everyone else and not someone special just because she is black and is going through more issues than the rest of the population out there. I hope the writters find a way to reframe her character so that she is not portraying those of color in a bad light. She doesnt deserve any special treatment just because she is african american and should stop making her coworkers feel that they need to treat her any differently from anyone else in the show.",literal
Going Down Hill This used to be a great TV show in seasons one and two. From there it's had it's ups and downs before but never as bad as this season. The 'Chenford' relationship is not good. I always thought they had more of a brother sister relationship and seeing those two making out is a bit creepy. The over done Bailey story lines are not good. First they portrayed her as super woman and then she suddenly didn't have enough sense to know the difference between a puppy and a coyote. The new Rookie and her silly psychic abilities are getting old and need to be toned way down. Hopefully they get some new writers soon and put this show back on track before it gets any goofier.,literal

"My favorite film of 2025 so far Sinners is a film I've been looking forward to watching for awhile now and was one of my most anticipated movies of the year. After finally watching it, I can say with confidence that this is my favorite movie so far to come out in 2025. When twin brother Smoke and Stack return home from Chicago to rural Mississippi for a fresh start, they decide to take what earnings they got left to open a nightclub. Unfortunately, other than some of their old hometown friends, old lovers, and a cousin, a much evil and greater force awaits for them just in time for the debut night of their new club. For starters, Michael B. Jordan gives probably the best performance of his career so far as the twins Smoke and Stack, bringing a different persona and personality to each of the characters. Hailee Steinfeld as Mary is magnificent and for the most part has some of the best character development of the film. Wunmi Mosaku as Annie is also great in this film, while also being a huge part of the heart and soul of it. Miles Caton as Sammie Moore is also a great addition to this film and plays a very important role in it. Omar Miller as Cornbread was also a great addition. Delroy Lindo as Delta Slim also gives a great supporting performance, while also having some of the best lines and moments of the movie. Finally Jack O' Connell as Remmick and the main villain of the movie was absolutely fantastic, terrifying, while also charming in a way and is probably one the best horror movie villains I've seen in recent years. Every time his character is on screen, he steals the show and more than gets the audience's attention. If there's anything negative I have to say about the film which is little to none, I would say in the first act, it took awhile for the story to get going, but once it does finally start to take off, it makes everything more than worth while. For positives, I would like to point out that music playing a huge role and technically a character itself in the film was sensational. The horror elements were also well done, as well as a couple of action scenes that were very impressive. Overall, Sinners is so far my favorite movie of 2025, with great performances all the way around, great cinematography, and a really great story with the direction of Ryan Coogler giving Jordan Peele a run for his money in the horror genre. Rating 10/10.",figurative
"Sin doesn't come to you - you either invite it or face it Sinners isn't your typical horror. It's soaked in sweat, blues, and black excellence. Think 24 hours of beauty and chaos - where freedom feels close, but sin feels closer. Ryan Coogler didn't just direct a film, he built a vibe. The twins? Played by the same actor, but felt like two different souls. The performances? Hailee Steinfeld kiss, wow. Dialogue? Fast, slick, sharp - like a jazz solo that cuts through silence.

This film doesn't hold your hand. You gotta lean in, feel the room, and ride the rhythm. There's a message under the madness - about legacy, temptation, and the price of stepping outside the lines.

Now, the vampire thing? I won't lie - felt like a stretch. Stylish, sure, but I wasn't sold on the metaphor. Still, the film carries itself with so much black flavor and focus that you forgive the weird. One-takes were clean, the sound was spiritual, and the whole thing hums like an old jukebox with a soul of its own.

Sinners doesn't preach - it performs. And it leaves you wondering if maybe, just maybe... sin was the only freedom left.",literal
"It's good, but... I really hate the modern music scores as the soundtrack for a period drama. It doesn't work and pulls you right out of the fantasy they're trying to create. I wish modern directors and producers realized this. Rule 101 of storytelling when you're playing in historical fiction -- do not use terms, music, etc that did not exist back then. Aside from the music, the word ""Bonehead"" was an Americanism that didn't even originate until the early 1900's and likely would not have been used in late 1800's Ireland. If you're doing a period drama - do it right. Don't keep pulling the viewer out of the story by introducing modern music and words. That is why I pulled three stars.",literal
"So uninteresting I do wonder how ""creatives"" manage to get jobs. My 3 rating means you will regret watching this.

How can you get elements which have worked well since he beginning of TV and produce this boring slog fest of irrelevancy.

I think it is a mixture of simply boring actors, delivering slow boring lines. You don't care about any of these characters.

I think Mark Ruffalo and his delivery fits the boringness of this whole production, it is a strong reason why there is absolutely nothing you care about to watch in this.

Running around fighting crime and all the other tropes which have always delivered since the beginning of time just fail. Throw in some unnecessary side plots just makes it worse because the core is rotten.

I give it a 3 because outside of the boring actors and the boring directing/camera work, the production value looks high, they obviously spent some money on this but everything else is so bad. I cant decide if the script was a contributor or the victim of this disaster.",literal
"Looking forward to next season The Diplomat has everything you want in a great series...it has comedy, drama, great acting and writing, etc, etc. The series is about a diplomat (Keri Russell) who has a new job as an ambassador to the United Kingdom after an international crisis happens when an aircraft carrier is attacked. She also has do deal with her husband (Rufus Sewell) who's already a political star and their rocky marriage. I liked this show so much I binged the entire eight episodes over the course of one weekend. It's been doing so good and it's been so well received that it's already gotten an early renewal for another season. I'll definitely be looking forward to watching that and seeing where this show goes.",literal

"So slow This is so slow. The premise is fantastic, but there just isn't enough action, and everything drags. Barely kept watching. There is just enough of a cliff hanger at the end of each episode to keep watching, but if my husband did not like it so much I would have stopped watching. He thinks it is interesting but we also aren't watching anything else right now and have a hard time agreeing on shows. Overall, the characters are not that likable, and there is very little emotional investment. I absolutely love the idea for the show, it is original and interesting. It is just way too slow. Waste of a great idea.",figurative

The characters were not realistic and the plot was contrived and dumb. The acting was OK.",literal
Not bad for the film debut for Chris but expected a lot more. So I'm a massive fan of Chris Struckmann and he's been someone I would constantly watch for his takes on films and when I heard he was directing his own film I knew I had to see this immediately. I really like this direction the film takes for the first half of the film and it's really strong and powerful throughout this first half of the film and it has some interesting themes and dynamics presented throughout the movie as well. There's also some really strong acting throughout the film as well and Camille Sullivan gives such a strong and powerful performance as Mia and her character was great. There's also some beautiful cinematography throughout the film and I really like the direction that Chris went with his filmmaking here but there's some things I just didn't quite like. There's some solid horror presented throughout the film and there were definitely some scenes which got me scared a bit some scenes just didn't work for me and the movie plays into these old horror tropes. The movie also gets really bizarre and confusing near the second half of the film and it leaves me with so many questions buzzing in my head about what just happened and I don't like how this movie really ended and I felt disappointed by these reveals presented in the film as well. There's also some lack of character development and I feel like the movie is really short and I wish they would've expanded on some things more throughout the film and I felt like they definitely could've touched on more things like the story and the character of Mia as well. Overall this is a fine horror film but it left me with too many questions and also just wanting more in the end but this is still worth checking out especially if you're a fan of Chris Struckmann.,literal
"Despite feeling like a bit of a chore at times, Lawrence shines and the themes are powerfully explored Wow. Lots to unpack here.

Firstly, when you google this film, its genre is listed as 'Thriller/Comedy' which is an insane categorisation. Sure, there may be a few moments of dark humour, but this film is incredibly bleak. Rightly so given the subject matter, but it is in no way a comedy. It is a very frank and eye opening look into postpartum depression, motherhood, and womanhood more widely.

There are layers to this film that, as a man, I will simply never understand. I can imagine that many women will feel seen and connect with this film in a very particular way, but even with that in mind I do feel this film was a bit too relentlessly oppressive. You could argue that it does a great job of putting us into the mind of Jennifer Lawrence's Grace, and experiencing what she was feeling. The monotony, the constant sound, the bloody dog barking and the baby crying, the isolation of not really having any other characters to interact with. It was a lot, and there was a definite intention to make the audience uncomfortable, just like Grace. But despite being effective at conveying the emotions at play, does that make for a compelling narrative and an engaging feature length film? I'm not so sure. Maybe this would have thrived a bit more as a short film.

One thing that I truly can't criticise in the slightest though is the powerhouse performance of Jennifer Lawrence. If somebody were to claim it was her career best I don't think I'd put up much of an argument against them. She is just all in on this performance and is so real, gritty, animalistic, physical, punchy, raw, vulnerable. She plays the light and dark and all the complex emotions impeccably. Pattinson is also great and does his best to match her, but this is really Lawrence's show from start to finish.

Ultimately then, I am actually a little undecided on this film. I loved so much of it. The performances are stellar, the layers so rich, there's so much meaning and emotion to unpack. But equally, I did find it to be a bit of a slog and I hate when a film feels like a chore, which this maybe did in parts. It also massively bummed me out when I watched it. I think this film is much better to talk about and digest after the fact than it is to watch it, if that makes any sense? For that reason alone, I think it is a most worthwhile experience.",figurative
"It's all in the Trailer The trailer spoils ninety percent of the movie. We are really left with scraps after seeing trailer like why? The movie isn't terrible but seriously the audience knows everything that is happening before it was shown for over a whole hour into the film (if they watched the trailer.) The advertising spots were too blatant, seriously eight or more products are being promoted in the most obvious ways. Also there are some very over the top corny moments. To the point that people were laughing when the movie was trying to be serious. Watchable though.",literal
"The ending was such a let down 75% of the movie is 10/10 has you on the edge of your seat.

The last 25% is the third POV of the American president, which is the 3rd POV of the same timeline in POV 1 and 2, and quite frankly it adds nothing to the story because he's clueless and we've heard all his responses already (apart from pointlessly calling his equally clueless wife for presidential advice.) I could have forgiven all that... IF WE HAD GOT A CONCLUSION.

An entire film leading up to the end and then the end doesn't happen may seem thought provoking but in my opinion is just let all that tension fall flat and I'm just angry I watched for 2 hours for 3/4 of a story.

What a shame as really had me hooked all the way to the end but then didn't finish the job. This is worse than my ex.",figurative
"From 10 to 1 The first 30-40min is very very good. Right into the action, edge of your seat stuff.

Caught myself thinking: ""How are they gonna keep this pressure and atmosphere going for 2 hours?"" Then BAM! They're not. It's the kind of movie that shows the same event from multiple perspectives. With minor new things adding to the story with each perspective. So past the first perspective, you know what's going to happen. It feels like you're watching the same thing over and over.

It's too bad. The first part is absolutely superb. The acting is on point throughout by people who deserve their star status.

But it completely loses all excitement after the first part.",figurative
"Are You OK? Enough already with everyone asking if everyone else is OK!

Well, this new series has all the vibes of the old 'ER', which frankly is curious because this show could appear on network TV. But, since it's on HBO MAX, why not make it more adult?!

That aside, the supporting cast, other than Noah Wyle (of course) are not of the caliber of the old 'ER', although there are some promising candidates. Noah, however, is on his 'A' game. I am further surprised that Shawn Hatosy is not more prominently featured and billed.

Otherwise, it has all the rhythms and pace of the old 'ER', and I did enjoy it, I just didn't love it. But, I will add it to my weekly viewing schedule.",literal
"Season 3 The Wokeness Monster Bad plot, disjointed storylines, unbelievable Russian involvement & the only monster in the move is the ""wokeness monster"".

"Low budget, high impact The movie has all the hallmarks of a very solid ""shoestring"" budget independent production.

Whether or not it's truly an indie movie is debatable but it has undoubtedly been put together by someone understands the limitations of movie-making's technical foundations. The found footage gives the production a lot of bang for the buck. The CGI special effects are used sparingly but well. Cinematography is on point and perhaps most importantly, the director's sensibility or ""tone"" is unique and shines through when it counts. Congratulations to our female lead who carries the movie. What a task. I know that can only be achieved with a supportive production team, too, so many thanks to all involved.

I certainly hope this leads to a sequel.",figurative
"Emma Lanthimos Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone's Overdone Partnership

Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone have undeniably created some striking films together, from The Favourite to Poor Things. Their collaborations often blend sharp surrealism with Stone's fearless performances, delivering moments of brilliance that linger. But let's be honest: their relentless streak of projects is starting to feel like a one-note symphony.

The issue isn't talent-Lanthimos's offbeat vision and Stone's chameleon-like acting are still top-tier. It's the sheer frequency. Back-to-back films with the same director-actor duo can sap the freshness from even the most inventive premises. Their latest efforts, while polished, echo the same quirky, detached tone and stylized weirdness that defined their earlier work. It's like watching a brilliant chef cook the same dish repeatedly-eventually, you crave a new flavor.

Stone's commitment to Lanthimos's eccentric worlds is admirable, but her constant presence risks turning their films into a predictable shtick. The audience deserves variety, and both artists are versatile enough to explore beyond this partnership. A break to work with other directors or actors could reinvigorate their craft and give us something new to savor. For now, this once-exciting collaboration feels like it's overstayed its welcome, leaving a stale aftertaste.",figurative
So far so good Only have seen the first 3 episodes but I have enjoyed it so far. Good balance of personalities with all the ghosts to keep the story interesting. I can see this being good for at least 3-4 seasons with the formula they have.,literal
"I can't watch it twice, in a good way. I absolutely adore the horror genre-especially on the big screen. Stephen King has always been, and still is, the true king of horror fiction, so I'm always eager to see his work adapted into film. That said, I completely misjudged the genre of The Long Walk. It's certainly horrific, but not in the traditional sense-it's more of a psychological nightmare, and I felt every single emotion in such a short space of time.

I went into this film almost blind. I didn't realize Francis Lawrence was the director, which makes total sense in hindsight. After reading The Hunger Games novels and seeing how Lawrence added more emotional depth when he took over with Catching Fire, his touch here feels familiar. I had only vaguely heard of the 1970s book and knew a little of the premise: a post-war world where 50 boys (100 in the novel) are forced into a brutal walk until only one remains standing. I had imagined something along the lines of The Hunger Games, just more violent, and naively thought I was in for a ""standard horror."" I was very wrong.

The Long Walk taps into nearly every human emotion imaginable. It doesn't shy away from the grim practicalities of its premise, either. As a viewer, you're left asking-and witnessing-questions like: what happens if someone gets sick? Needs the toilet? Falls asleep? Breaks a leg? The film answers them all, sometimes in ways you wish it wouldn't.

Of course, there are differences from the book. Some changes actually feel more realistic, such as the walking pace the boys must maintain. Others may leave viewers-like my boyfriend-wanting more about the wider universe: who created this contest, why it exists, or what happens afterward. But that's not what the story is about. It's about one bleak, relentless, and emotionally devastating ordeal-the walk itself and the boys who are trapped in it.

I had debated between seeing the new Conjuring film or The Long Walk for my ""new horror cinema night."" I don't think either would have left me feeling the same way. Only one other Stephen King adaptation has affected me as strongly-The Green Mile. Like that film, The Long Walk is unforgettable, but not something I could ever watch twice. Maybe I'm just too empathetic for psychological horror, but I'm glad I saw it-and I know I'll never forget it.",literal
"Fantastic dispointment Thing's beard and voice are just awful, and the action scenes feel like cutscenes from a video game-disconnected and bland. Pascal is a solid actor, but he doesn't fit the role of Reed at all. Honestly, I can't think of anything that truly stands out in a good way. Sue and Johnny are... okay, I guess.",figurative
"Jim Carrey was what made the movie funny. I have seen this movie 5 or 6 times and every time I see it the only character that was funny was Jim Carrey as the grinch. Some of the

other characters were good in their roles but if Jim Carrey had not been in this film it would have bummed out. Never the less the movie it self had a very interesting storyline but could never compare to the all time Dr. Suess classic. I realize they had to stretch the

story out in the movie considering it was an hour and a half long movie instead of a half an hour cartoon and they did OK. So if you haven't seen this movie yet see it if you like Jim Carrey because he did a fantastic job playing the grinch in this movie.",literal
"Great Storyline, great cast Really enjoying the show so far. I understand others being uncomfortable with the daughter's role so far. However, as a father of 3 daughters, all now grown up, I get where it's coming from, especially in this day and age. I was fortunate enough that none of them were as extreme as this young lady, but I understand how he reacts as a father. I can also see where that particular storyline might be heading.

Lots of little twists and turns and nothing too far out there that it becomes unrealistic. Got to give Sheridan his due, he knows how to write a story and how to keep the viewer engaged. Thornton is as excellent as ever as are the rest of the cast. I hope this one continues for at least a few more seasons as I feel there is a lot of story still to tell.",literal
"This show insults my intellect How can people stand this show? It's so unrealistic, formulaic and lacking in emotion and substance. I just can't believe it's lasted so long, let alone become a franchise.

People going about their business find a body. Usually that scene has some ""social commentary"". Detectives arrive at the scene and say something clever. Credits. They interview family members and friends, who are saddened but not much, either because they're talentless actors or the writers realized a realistic depiction of grief every episode would overwhelm the audience. The usual suspect is discarded, then they arrest the unusual suspect. Then arraignment, then a bunch of motions where McCoy has to clean up the detective's mess because every episode they violate someone's civil rights. Then a couple of witnesses testify a whole minute (pleeease!) and then the verdict. That is, of course, after the very realistic and thought-out two minute long closing arguments.

Yeah, one episode = one trial. It's not like trials take weeks or months IRL, and apparently the cops always make an arrest within days.

And I say, why not make this show realistic and depict what a week in the detective's and prosecutor's life at work would be like (working many cases, which develop at different speed)? Damages appears to be the only realistic legal drama out there when it comes to time. Seriously, if you watch this garbage you're part of the problem.

It's time we, as an audience, demand some respect and stop supporting shows that insult our intelligence.",literal
"Game of Arrows? Really enjoying this.

Great fun.

Could I pick holes in it? Yeh sure.

Historical innacuracies, Little John casting will annoy some and it breaks from the traditional story....

But Sean Bean as the Sheriff of Nottingham, talk about perfect casting. I also like the rest of the cast and the production values are good for a tv show.

Plus, I am kinda getting Game of Thrones vibes from it. Much more adult in nature than previous versions and the plot changes appear to be an attempt at world building. Plus it has a bit of fantasy in it (kinda like the 80s Jason Connery Tv show).

It might all fizzle out but this show has a lot of potential with all of the additional characters and plot threads they have introduced. If it can build upon what I have seen so far (just seen episode 3), this could be up there with the aforementioned Game of Thrones.

Is it really 10 stars? Ok, more like 8 at the moment but is so good to see a show that is just out to entertain and it has the potential to be a 10 star show.

Also, people are entitled to their opinions but there are some very low ratings on here (2 stars) and I think they are overly harsh. So the 10 stars is to balance out the score a little.",literal
"Gripping show This is a consistently strong and thought provoking show. It has not lost its appeal over the year and maintain a vice like grip on its viewers. Great detective work, policing and procedural.",literal
Great New Series on TV this season+ This is a great series to watch.  I have been hooked on this show since the beginning because I love watching mysteries and crime like CSI and CSI Miami.  Harmon's so sexy in this role and McCallum is always a joy to watch as Ducky especially when he's on the role over various anthropology lectures which to my amusement everyone on that shows roll up their eyeballs.,literal
"Without Substance If you are easily wooed by good set design, CGI and 2-3 good scenes then you'll love it. If you would like any meaningful storyline look elsewhere.

Emotional connections between characters were shallow and actual plot points were treated almost as an inconvenience. Whilst the singing was of great quality, it lacked the emotive wider cast belt-outs I expect from a powerful musical. It felt to me that everyone was trying so hard to be their own oscar-winning performance they forgot to act WITH eachother.

The dance scene between Elphaba and Galinda tries hard to be a statement piece but despite Cynthia's great individual performance the chemistry between them falls short yet again.

I was led to believe this film would be full of emotion and rip-roaring acting but I'm left as disconnected as the plotlines.",literal

A far more realistic next series would be an American ambassador considered to be as hostile to the UK as Russia, China and North Korea.

Perhaps a plot where the USA ambassador together with the CIA working together with the Russian FSB and SVR to undermine the British state to forward the imperialist ambitions of the USA would be a more up to date plot line.",literal

"I enjoyed this series but... The first couple seasons were fun and light, getting to know the ghosts' personalities and talents and history of each ghost but as the series progressed it focused more on the sex lives of the ghosts and less of the fun antics and situations they cause. I abandoned it partway through season 3 it was just getting to be too much of the focus. I wish TV writers would understand that people don't care about the sex lives of characters on the screen, but instead the actual character development.

I switched to the UK version and it was better about being light and funny and very little sexual focus.",literal
"Nice movie but... This isn't just about Disney; recently, animated movies as a whole seem to have become overly simplistic. While I understand that the primary audience is children, kids' movies used to be far more thought-provoking. This one feels overly basic, with simplistic dialogue and humor. The plot develops in a very obvious way, making the next scene almost always predictable.

The backstory was intriguing, and the music was enjoyable, but the film lacked nuance and missed opportunities to create deeper emotional resonance. It overexplained everything, guiding the audience too heavily instead of allowing the story to unfold naturally. A few well-placed pauses or moments of silence could have provided space for viewers to reflect on what had just happened and anticipate what might come next. Not everything needs to be explicitly stated, leaving room for imagination and interpretation would have made the experience far richer.",literal
"Another series where LA We have to stop letting transplants make shows about Los Angeles that erase the real LA and the people who built it.

The show doesn't reflect LA - it reflects her filtered, white-washed, influencer-fantasy version of it.

This isn't representation. It's erasure.

And the gentrification of neighborhoods like Echo Park - both on-screen and in real life - needs to end. Go check out This Fool on Hulu. It's realistic while being funny, cool, and everything this show thinks it is.",literal
Missed the mark Could have been so good but the acting and characters left me wanting more. I kept hoping Billy Bob Thornton would appear and take the place of Ethan Hawke. Most white characters are portrayed as racist and ignorant. Best part is the relationship between Lee and his daughter. Felt no emotion when watching. So boring...,literal
"One of John Hughes' best films Every high school boy's dream comes true in this wayward film about a couple of guys creating the ultimate woman. Cool, confined and well acted (considering the bad cast), this film really captures some of the follies of 1980s youth. The materialism, the shallowness and the lack of parental control really demonstrates what kids back then really wanted. While I was not a teenager at this time, it was still a fun movie to watch, one that kept me interested the entire time I watched it.",literal
"Solid mini series Task is a solid mini series for binge watching that doesn't overwhelm or require too much thinking. This is the type of show if you're following like 2-3 other series and you need a break from these shows, something to ""rest your brain"", task is that kind of show, and it won't disappoint you.

Don't be fooled by the first episode if it feels boring! It feels a bit slow because it's focused on introducing the characters and setting the tone, but things definitely pick up after that. It has some dark and heavy moments, so it can feel a bit depressing at times.

The acting is good, the story is decent, and overall it leaves a solid impression 7/10 (not bad-not great).",figurative
"Absolute garbage No really. Absolute, mind numbing, brain rotting garbage that's not even worth watching while you do something else. Kevin James has never really been funny and in this he is just embarrassing while Ritchson demonstrates he is just a one trick pony and anyone who watched season 3 of Reacher knows he is all out of tricks. Plot? Well there isn't one really; tried hard/looser step dad (James) and his son meet up with perfect dad (Ritchson) and his off spring and a bond is formed amid a revolving door of stupid security contractors, a high tech millionaire and child clones - it even sounds stupid as I type it. The set pieces are weak, the gags excruciating and the pacing is all over the place. I gave it an hour, which was way more than it deserved, and then turned it off. Please don't watch, even if you are an Amazon subscriber like me whose subscription is being wasted on this crap, find something else to do.",literal
"Crazy movie but what an incredible soundtrack Yes the movie manages to encompass every genre imaginable, but it certainly keeps you in your seat with nary a dull moment. Even though its cheesy several actors do stand out. By far the most impressive thing is the brilliant sountrack, judt thst alone makes it a rollicking ride.",literal
"Now I wish I hadn't seen you I really wanted to love this, but it was a shambles and let me tell you why. Firstly, before that, the score written by Brian Tyler, is fantastic as always, but couldn't save what was a bland sequel to two great movies. The script was badly written, the characters were one dimensional and cliche, there was no explanation given when needed and then, explanation given when it wasn't needed. It ended badly and then with an even bigger cliche than I could ever have expected (which I won't spoil for others). A masters student in script writing or Chat GPT could have done a better job - just dire.",literal
"Only John Hughes could make this work. It truly is one of the most bizarre and insane movies I have ever seen, yet in its own unique way it has a heart and soul and an actual lesson to teach us. Combining elements from his previous movie, Sixteen Candles, and the science-fiction genre, Hughes creates a world that isn't fully rooted in reality but has realistic characters you are able to interact with. As the story goes, two nerds are tired of being made fun of and perceived as uncool. They decide to use their computer and create the perfect woman which will then elevate their status at school and in society, they think. What they don't count on is that it turns out to be an intelligent, English woman who has more in store for them than they wanted.

To get right down to it, this is the most unusual of the John Hughes movies but it also maintains that message that is so prominent in other movies like Sixteen Candles and The Breakfast Club. I didn't grow up in the 80's, but I am sure that teens felt ostracized and left out in many aspects of their life, least not including high school. What Hughes has done with the three aforementioned movies as well as others later in his career is that he has created characters that are memorable, flawed and willing to listen to change that could benefit them. To enjoy this you have to look past the bizarre climax and the other subplots and appreciate that someone made a movie for you as a teenager, a person and not just a dollar sign.",literal
"Got me glued to the tv Very good show, got me invested in the story until the end. Can't believe this was not renewed for more seasons. So many crapy shows out there. This was really good quality suspense.",literal
"Originally a very underrated show but should have quit while they were ahead. The first seasons of this show were incredible, a new way to do crime shows which for a while had become essentially all the same. The problem this show had was that it was great from the start, you love all the characters and get very attached to them and that becomes an issue because over the course of the first 6 or 7 seasons in particular many of them don't make it for one reason or another. At the start they kind of got away with it, they replaced characters with more good ones. But in the end many of the fan favourites have disappeared and it has damaged the sort of family bond that those characters had making the show move away from what it originally started out as. In particular cutting Gideon, JJ and Prentiss really hurt the show and somehow seemed to damage the storylines with it (somewhat covered for a while by Hotchner and his story which for me was the last brilliant one). Now it's become somewhat unrecognisable and it's a shame, but the first several seasons alone are worth watching and why i'll still rate this show so highly much like The Simpsons it would be unfair to condemn the whole series and ignore some excellent parts.",literal
"Well..., As others have said,absolutely historicity crap,actors do as they are told by people who write for mtv and the American tv networks. Woman ,where are your comments or are you so sad you have to lay semi conscience in your bed(most of the time in this series)or manipulating with sex.

A very poor man's version of got. Robert(Robin) looks like he's in his late 20's but acts like an 11 yr old.

"light on scares So I went and saw IT, and came back unimpressed. I mean it was a good movie, no doubt about that. A bunch of kids, outcasts in their own right, being terrorized by an ancient demon that plays upon the fears of its victims is pretty much the standard in Hollywood horror movie territory. All the kids are well cast, the script is funny and tight, and there are plenty of monster shots. The cinematography is great, the pace is even and the CGI is flawless. But is more funny than terrifying- it's R rating more a justification of teenage slang in the script, rather than for true scares. 

But that is what typically Stephen King is all about. His stories are studies on relationships rather than all out horror. In IT, King reversed Spielberg's E.T, and explored everyday monsters of childhood- abuse, violence and neglect. Juxtapose that with an eternal evil shape-shifting entity who wakes up every 27 years to prey, and you have a shawarma of a plot. The book is scary, the movie isn't. Probably so because today, we are used to Stranger Things. 

We are used to kids doing stupendous stuff these days- whether running billion dollar companies, or bringing back lost souls from other dimensions. It all seems very easy for today's generation to figure things out- most of IT establishes this narrative. A wonderful group of actors face off against Bill Skarsgard's Pennywise the Dancing Clown, and they all nail their parts. The movie takes place in a town where all the adults are essentially villains- so its not just the kids versus the clowns everyone else. But for sheer impact, IT never reaches the highs it achieves in its first sequence. 

It is a great example of how strong marketing can make mediocre movies look a billion bucks. Other reviewers are putting IT right up there with other Stephen King adaptions such as The Shining and The Thing. Oh please, that would be laying it too thick. Director Andy Muschietti's earlier take on the genre- Mama, is a far better contender.

No good horror movie can get away by being light on scares, however good the characters and the script are. So look at IT as an extension of Goonies or Stranger Things, a PG-13 romp, not an iconic horror movie. 7/10",literal
"Funny trailer, shallow and boring movie Good idea but zero follow through. Worst of all it wasn't funny. The jokes were few and far between and at best they were so lame as was the whole story. No one laughed in the entire theater. The movie is trying to make some point about income inequality yet its final message is ""it's okay to be on the verge of homelessness because we have each other."" He never reaches some epiphany. We don't feel any catharsis through his character. It's so forced and filled with exposition. Keanu was the only good thing about this movie even though his character's potential was completely squandered. Keanu as a dissatisfied guardian angel could've been its own movie and probably funnier. Aziz probably sold this idea and then quickly turned out a script just like he recently sold a half baked stand up tour and wrote last minute material that was pitiful. During his set he openly expressed disdain for being there and was only doing it to pay for his future kid and joked about his future divorce. Seems like a pattern. He could do so much better and has been so much funnier in the past. It really seems like he doesn't care about comedy anymore which is a shame.",figurative
"I think now... We've seen enough remakes of this movie. There are some I really like, en watch over sometimes. But this one is nothing new. It's boring, and takes to long. Hard to keep conversation. It's to slow. And I don't like the victor actor als a Frankenstein. And the monster it self.... nah. Sorry but this one is not for seeing twice.",literal
"Season 6 starts filming in September 2020! Season 5 continues to do at least two things brilliantly:

1/. BCS depicts several characters who all appear to have an inner life, fears, guilt, desires, things that really annoy them and which make them do what they do. And the characters change over time, misunderstand one another, and resent one another. As BCS continues, the illusion that you are witnessing the lives of people you know becomes even stronger. The very opposite of a melodrama, where the 'characters' behave predictably to type.

2/. It's a prequel to 'Breaking Bad', considered one of the best mainstream TV series ever made; at least up there with 'The Wire' and 'The Sopranos'. What Peter Gould has managed to do is absolutely explain the backstory to tragedies we already know will happen in a thrilling and suspenseful way.

Hey, it isn't perfect all the time (how does Lalo know where Gus's dead drops are so as to tell Krazy8?), but I continue to give it 10s because unlike so many shows (and movies) in this, the Age Of Streaming, BCS doesn't ever insult my intelligence.

There will have been 63 episodes at the end of season 6. One day I'll binge them and the 62 Breaking Bads AND El Camino in sequence. °°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°° Just watched S04e01. Mike Ehrmentraut as the Health and Safety Officer from Hell is utterly hilarious, counterpoint to the morbidity and solemnity going on elsewhere with Chuck's suicide. And who doesn't want one of those buggies? B-rilliant.

BCS is doing something that NOBODY else in TV is doing. Inventing real characters in a horrible - but plausible - situation, and being completely faithful to their natures, wherever it leads. That's why you might watch the credits and recognise all the actors as their names come up, instead of thinking they sound like US accountancy firms. This is the complete opposite of melodrama, which is what 96% of the other stuff does. Buy, beg, steal or borrow Better Call Saul because your grandchildren will want to know why you missed it, and will want your copy.

Original review:

Jimmy McGill tries to do the right thing but it always goes wrong.

Heard of Emile Zola and Honoré de Balzac? 19th century French novelists who each wrote a series of novels that used the same characters from one novel to the next; in one they would be lead character, in another a support. Am I comparing BCS and Breaking Bad to classic French novels? Well yes; even the delivery format of modern 'cable' series is similar to the monthly publications of novels in the 1800s. Vince Gilligan and his team are certainly the front runners by far in the modern quality pop culture stakes. And in both BB and BCS, as with those writers, we have an uncompromising background of modern urban life.

It helps to have watched 'Breaking Bad' - in that series, the suspense was perfect; no-one knew what would happen, and no character apart from Walter White seemed indispensable - Jesse was to have been written out in series 1, after all. In 'Better Call Saul', you again have the teaser at the beginning, where Saul is flipping burgers in a shopping mall eaterie in Nebraska, paranoid about being recognised. If you've seen BB, you might suspect that this is only a partial teaser, Vince Gilligan setting you a trap. If you haven't, BCS looks like a flashback of 'how Jimmy McGill got to middle-aged mall misery', which probably doesn't provide the dramatic suspense that Walter White's cancer diagnosis did. But then, Breaking Bad started with a crazy Winniebago chase as well. Better Call Saul is more in the 'Chinatown' groove than Breaking Bad's surreality - so far.

That qualification aside, BCS is written, produced and performed to the same excellent standard of Breaking Bad, and Bob Odenkirk has no complaints from me on the acting chops. His is a sad, solitary character, his only foils being his sick brother Chuck, and Jonathan Banks as the parking attendant from Middle Earth, so you don't get the crackling dynamic that Walter and Jesse had.

But it's early days, I'm on Ep03 and if there's one thing you can count on, it's that Vince Gilligan will play with and exceed your expectations. It's not whether it's 'as good' or 'better' than BB. It's just as good. It's just that the lead character is less sympathetic, and doesn't have as far to go. Or does he?

°°°°°°°° °°°°°°°°°° °°°°°°°°° °°°°°°° °°°°°°°° °°°°°°°°° °°°°°°°°° °°°°°

And so, a year or so later, we're into season II. I feel sorry for those who have not learned to trust Vince G. and Peter G.'s storytelling, and are therefore bored by the mental work involved in enjoying BCS.

Don't you see, people? Slippin' Jimmy's 'proper' lawyer brother styles himself as the supremely professional, ethical one, but he stitches up his (caring, earnest) brother with the callousness of a Roman emperor - JUST LIKE REAL PEOPLE DO.

Jimmy's girlfriend depends on him to make life interesting, but expects him to remain in control of the chaos he creates - JUST LIKE REAL PEOPLE DO.

Mike the enforcer wants to be a genial grandpa, but gets his beloved granddaughter to help him make a 'stinger' to stop a drug truck that directly results in the death of a good Samaritan, while telling his dead son's wife that it's a soaker for the rhododendrons - JUST LIKE - you get it.

Oh, the nuances. If you're missing them, you would benefit from an introductory course in scriptwriting. Better Call Saul is streets ahead of anything else and will be savoured and appreciated long into the future. It's so good, it makes the awesome, revolutionary, phenomenal 'Breaking Bad' look like a soap opera.

The TV equivalent of Shakespeare + Tolstoy + Dostoyevsky at their best. ""Your review contains a very long word which is not allowed"". I take that as a compliment. Oh, I see, it was the divider.",figurative
"A particular movie So, when I went to the cinema, I didn't know what to expect. For many people, it was either a 10/10 or a 0/10 film, but the strangest thing was that I knew absolutely nothing about the plot! At the beginning of the film, it felt overwhelming. It seemed rushed and poorly made, like an amateur video shot by a bunch of drunk guys, and it was full of sexual scenes that I honestly didn't understand.

As the film went on, though, the story became more serious, the main character started to take shape and develop a stronger personality, and overall, the movie became more enjoyable. The plot shifts from a political drama to a family drama, and in my opinion, there are also some hidden critiques of the current American government... but nothing certain.

The colonel character is fantastic-Sean Penn gives an Oscar-worthy performance (and I think he'll win it). He manages to convey fear and authority, and the director clearly uses him as part of a broader critique. In some moments, he even reminded me of No Country for Old Men, even though the two antagonists are very different.

DiCaprio is good, but not Oscar-worthy in my opinion. The part he drew from The Big Lebowski was convincing, but I think he's been better in other films, like Django Unchained. Still, he manages to be both entertaining and serious.

One thing I didn't like was the use of a handheld camera in some scenes-thank God they didn't shoot the whole film like that, or it would've been a huge shame. Also, some scenes could've done without the constant soundtrack, although in other moments the music works very well.

Overall, the film is really good, with a cast that delivers (except for Perfidia), and a plot that's quite deep but eventually explains itself clearly. Do I agree with those calling it the film of the year? Yes, absolutely-for what has been released so far, it's definitely up there, though it does have some strong competition. Watch it-you won't regret it, but pay attention!",literal
"I can't believe they compare this to the Jesse Stone series It's just so lackluster. The mysteries are not mysterious. The detective is not engaging. The romance is slow-moving. The subsidiary characters are underused. I can't believe that people are comparing this to Tom Selleck's Jesse Stone series, which was based on the great books by Robert B. Parker. However, I will give it another try when the second season starts up, in case they make it more interesting than it has been so far.",literal
"Bring it behind a barn and shoot it I feel bad for the people who donated in the Kickstarter and then had to witness this piece of trash.

The director needs to go to film school and learn the depth of making a great horror film before rushing with peoples money and producing a low quality youtube-like film.... it feels like a cash grab Chris.

This film feels like it was made by a high school student who had 5k dollar budget and made the script in 15 minutes....

It feels like a 2009 made-for-tv movie premiering on the SyFy channel....but atleast those corny movies have charm and actors who cared.

Cant believe it made theater release, Tubi would deny this. Avoid at all costs.",literal
"I'm really digging Emily! This isn't your typical cop show. And the lead character, Emily, is no wilting flower. She's flawed, has some emotional issues, but she's a badass. She doesn't suffer fools, and tolerates no BS. Too many shows have weak female characters, or they're just really whiney and b!+@#¥. The writing is good. Granted, there have been some holes in it here and there, but overall, it's done pretty well.

Take a look at this one.",literal
"Romance battling with murder I really liked this movie. Alburg moves to a small quite town to soothe the psyche that has been buttered by big city worked by police.bt find himself needing to call upon all his skills to solve the murders that continue to wash up. Ditactive came to Gibson at a moment of change in his own life and by the sea side community, as for now l am still watching and the movie is so much promising.it reminds me of one of those romantic battling with murder movies.and it also taught us about real life daily living.l also think that the promoters need to do their job .it's quite an educate movie due to our living .quite interesting.",literal
Disappointed I was really looking forward to this movie because I have loved the previous Three Men movies. The first one was one of my favorite Hallmark movies. This one was a complete letdown. They kept trying to come up with funny scenes that just sizzled out. There was still good chemistry with the brothers but that was about all. The last 15 minutes were the only good part and then it was ridiculous. Bringing new born babies out around everyone in the hospital! Hallmark movies have really been a disappointment this year.,literal
"GREAT series. ""Law & Order"" is one of those classic TV shows that deserve a high rating. There are very few in my opinion (""I Love Lucy"", Star Trek: The Next Generation being a few to mention). This show was created by Dick Wolf (who would end up creating 3 spin-offs based on this show). It is also one of the longest running shows out there (it has been on since 1990 and shows no signs of slowing). There were many great actors who have been on the show but I think the best one to date is the late Jerry Orbach as Detective Lennie Briscoe and Sam Waterston as Executive A.D.A. Jack McCoy. The story lines are always exciting because we are taken along to discover what each episode is about, the ending usually intelligent and pleasantly surprising. The use of music is exemplary too - the music of Mike Post (who also does the music for the spin-offs Criminal Intent and SVU). A great show and I hope it will be on for a long time - 9 out of 10.",literal
"A thought provoking intense thriller that will leave you on the edge of your seat until an ending that will likely divide opinions A House of Dinamite is another proof of how Great a director Kathryn Bigelow is and by far one of the most intense and nerve-wracking movies of the year - scarier than most horror films out there. It presents a fictional scenario so real that it will leave you speechless and on the edge of your seat until the very last second.

Superbly written, acted, shot, and edited, the film shines in every department, complete with a fittingly thrilling score. Its narrative is ingeniously crafted to build tension and truly put you in the shoes of the characters, making you ask yourself: What would I do? How would I react?

Despite an open ending that will likely divide viewers - something I usually dislike - here it feels so intentional and well-executed that I actually loved it. The film's message is clear, direct, and deeply resonant. Everyone should see this movie and take its message to heart.",figurative
"Great acting, interesting premise, but writing is the obstacle I am three full seasons into this show. I recommend it because I think the acting is top notch. Linney plays a woman who has been diagnosed with stage 4 cancer. Her performance is outstanding, as is Platt's as the husband, and her homeless brother played by John Benjamin Hickey. Other supporting actors also do very well in this show. No complaints there.

In addition, there are many, many novel (and hilarious) predicaments the characters find themselves in. I think the premise and many of the storylines are quite eye-opening. Twists and turns throughout that kept me going these first three seasons.

Where I must complain is that the character development and the over-the-top nature of some of the scenes are making me wonder whether I will start Season 4.

I have been told by some people that I am a cynical, selfish person in many ways. But compared to the characters in this show, I'm a regular Mother Theresa. I fully realize being diagnosed with terminal cancer can lead to people acting in selfish ways, but my Lord is this show ridiculous sometimes. The brother, Sean, is unbelievably selfish, to the point he abandons Cathy on a snorkel dive and follows some young hottie he's bopping. Sean actually blames the young hottie (and his loins) for him leaving his sister while underwater.

In another example, Cathy can't tell Paul (Platt) she's proud of him and his new speaking career, as you just see the jealousy oozing out of her with every cynical comment. These are just two examples. There are about 50 more. And the worst part about it is not once have I heard a ""sorry"" except a couple of times in the first season. And their actions never back up their words. None of these characters ever self reflect and say to themselves, ""Jeez, I can't be like that anymore"" or ""gosh why was I so selfish, I was almost responsible for my sister drowning!"" No Sean, it's the hottie's fault.

All their alone time it seems is about finding what makes them happy. And none of it involves having heart to hearts with themselves about why only they matter. In addition, when someone is confronted by another character, the response is always in the vein of:. ""well, you did it"" like a five year old would. And yes, I know it's realistic that grownups argue that way, but not 100% of the time! It's getting exhausting seeing Linney, one of my top five favorite actresses, talk about herself SO MUCH.

I recommend the show because it's good. It's well acted with an interesting arc and some wild situations, but the cynicism keeps this show from being very good or even great. Even an old cynic like me says STOP ALREADY!",figurative
"NOT A Prequel If you are a fan of Stephen King's writing, do NOT bother with this garbage! I do not know how SK can continue to see his work destroyed. He should sue and stop letting people ruin and plagiarize it. {IM/AMZ sure is all for censorship x 3 now.} First the original story starts in 1958 and states that IT returns every 27 years - and IT supposedly has been around since the beginning of time. Mike Hanlon points this out and shows photos going back to the 1800's when IT takes the form of a clown. SO if you were smart and were going to do a prequel, you would start there. Instead this is set in 1962, 4 years AFTER the Loser club hits IT with the silvershot. This series is only on episode 2 and it is a complete snoozefest. Instead of IT there is some weird mutated baby that makes no sense whatsoever. IT would be hybernating/ half dead in 1962. Fuchs and Muschiettis apparently cannot come up with their own stuff so they had to pilfer off Sk's work. On top of the plagiarism, this 'story' is yet another time period piece that is trying to rewrite history in how people behaved, dressed, talked, etc. The vernacular is incorrect, the cars, attire, look, and sets are badly done in '25's version of '62 instead of accurately portraying '62. This makes the series completely unwatchable. This series is awful and so far IT has not even shown up - so it's just a rouse to get people to watch. Don't bother!!! This series completely changes the original story very very badly whilst using Stephen King's name to get people to watch; and it is trying to rewrite the story instead of respecting the original story. It severely disrespects SK's universe. Rewriting the story does not make it better, it just proves there is no original imagination left.",literal
"Dull, boring and has no actual ending The movie starts with a reasonable storyline, good actors and fine filmmaking. It continues with complete boredom, different aspects and the story and no attempt at an actual ending. Then actors are good and the theory of the story is reputable, but the telling of the story, or the failure the tell the story is done extremely poorly. I would suggest just finding a different movie to spend tow hours with.",literal
Best crime show to date They are honest and truthful and bring light to the real crimes and how things should be within Law. I've never felt so connected to a show that makes you realise that there is hope out there and that the show will always be true to culture and the current crimes that are in the world today I'm grateful for the show and everything that they give to us,literal
"At least get bow law right I never write reviews on here but this annoyed me. If you're going to do a Robin Hood film and have a father teaching his son about using a bow, at least get it right. Oh and don't have proficient Archers walking around with their bows strung across their backs. All good longbow Archers know to keep a bow strung like that does the wood no good. Bows or their strings also don't creak and if a bow did creak like that I'd not be shooting it as its close to snapping. In some shots they show the arrows flying off the thumb and others off the knuckles - no wonder young Robin was so bad at hitting his target. No consistency at all. And that was just in the first 15min. Other historical inaccuracies have been covered in other reviews. I didn't get through 30min of the first episode.",literal
"Very good I liked the new series very much. Whether the young Gibbs looks like Mark Harmon is really not important. All of the actors were good, the story line was compelling, and it kept me very entertained. I liked seeing characters like a young Franks, and will enjoy seeing portrayals of events in Gibbs'' history that the original has referred to. I liked it better than some of the other NCIS shows, although I do miss LA. Finally, it was nice to see Mark Harmon and hear his voiceovers as he remembers Gibbs' past. Maybe it's not perfect, but definitely a win for me. I will keep watching and I really hope it gains a large audience.",literal
"Obsessed!! I love everything Tim Robinson is in. He's funny, unhinged and the plot of this series is hilarious! I'm only on episode 3 and I am praying this show goes the distance. I've been waiting for an actual clever comedy series and I haven't watched a single episode of this series without laughing my a** off. I'm hoping for season 2 and more!

If people are giving this a poor rating, they don't know Robinson's humor and probably take themselves too seriously. Shows like It's Always Sunny and I Think You Should Leave are for people like me who enjoy the chaos with the comedy!!",literal
"Has really gone downhill SVU used to be one of my favourite shows. There's been some incredible, edge-of-your-seat episodes like ""911"", but now it's mostly he-said she-said's and statutory rapes between two willing participants (i.e. 15 year old girl and 16 year old guy). Yes, it's more realistic and true to life, but that's not why I watch TV like this. If I wanted realistic crime shows I'd watch Highway Cops or something - not Law & Order.

The political agenda pushing that's become central to the show is beyond aggravating. As the most liberal, feminist, pro-immigration, anti-racist, anti-fascist person around, having the views I already believe in forced down my throat every time I'm trying to chill out and watch TV is frustrating. It's also even more frustrating knowing how pointless it is - SVU is a crime show, it's not going to make anyone reconsider their politics, and it's dumb to isolate people from a show they've enjoyed for decades just because their politics differ to yours. The way it's all approached feels really patronising and tacky too - and the ""my way is the right way"" attitude is unhelpful in creating any positive political discussion.

Season 19 has been better than the past few seasons - there's been a few more engaging plot lines. It's still not even close to how it used to be though, where virtually every episode was an 8/10 with 9's being a common occurrence. Now it's more like every episode is a 5/10, and we're lucky if we get a 7.

I don't watch the show regularly anymore; I just resort to it when there's literally nothing else I can think of to watch. It sucks because it was so good, and I don't even think the new cast is too bad (yeah, they're not the OG's, but I can deal with it if the plots are good). It seemed to get a lot worse when Mariska Hargitay took over as Executive Producer.

Bring back engaging plots please and stop the political tripe. :(",literal
"Falters in the second half The original pilot episode was something truly special. It was quick, funny, irreverent, and had that unique flavour you don't know you've been missing until you've tried it. I was so excited for the full series, and it's delivered a lot--but also left some to be desired.

Visually, they've upped their game. The style is simple but absolutely beautiful for what it is and I love the design of almost every character. The music, although overused at times, ties in with the story on every level, and there are some legitimate bops in there. Amazing characters that are all endearing, charming and unapologetically quirky. The wit is there, for the most part, but it comes across less original and more on the safe side. You can feel the network hemming it in from behind the scenes. Where the show falls apart for me is the plot, particularly in the second half of the season. It just stumbles into every cliche along the way. For a show that claims a more mature outlook, it all feels a tad juvenile. In a way, it undermines some of the more adult themes and messages they sprinkle across the season. I'll definitely be tuning in for what's next, but I feel some of the potential was wasted on trying way hard to fit into a larger network's point of view.",figurative
"Benson and Rollins show Ever since about series 22 it has been the Benson and Rollins show. Most of the scenes are with these two characters now. Are they the only two who care, they both have children but never see them due to their obsession with work. The rest of the cast dont get a look in. My favourite cop was John Munch, but he sadly left. Liv has certainly perfected that constipated look. Carisi is a very angry shouty man. Its becoming a bit unbelievable.

Some of the stories are still watching but now series 23 they are in the minority. I hope somebody up there is watching because i think the sainthoods are in the post for Benson and Rollins.",literal
"It is hard to say what this is - apart from very, very good Ever wondered what happens to spies when they screw up?

They end at Slough House.

These are not your ""James Bond"" type spies but a collection of pen-pushers, surveillance operators and analysts - all headed up by a burnt-out ""proper"" espionage agent.

The casting and performances are absolutely amazing!

Gary Oldman is perfect as the foul-mouthed straight-shooting disgraced agent who has zero f's to give.

The scenes where he tells (to their faces) how much he despises his co-workers and how useless they are, are pure gold.

Kristin Scott Thomas is the foil to Gary Oldman and is outstanding! She totally holds the show together.

The kidnappers are also very, very good in rather unpleasant ways.

This has gritty moments, funny moments, shocks that will make you spill your tea and heart warming moments that will make you reach for the tissues.

I found the first half of the first episode quite boring - I am not a massive fan of spy films and I would have turned it off if I had something better to do - it is worth sticking with it.",figurative
"Heartbreaking and Disturbing Drama First, I have to say that I've always been a fan of Mark Ruffalo and Tom Pelphrey, who always seems to find roles where he's a troubled man with a sympathetic side. You always find yourself wanting to root for him, despite his flaws.

The writing is exceptional in that it breaks down each character into their present and past, and what brings them to where they are now at this moment. The acting is flawless, and sometimes you find it difficult to separate the actor from the character. I found it interesting that several of the co-stars are from other countries; yet, they manage to hide their accents (you're surprised during the bonus scenes at the end of each episode where the actors speak as themselves.). The scenes between characters Tom and Robbie are heartbreaking because they seem to understand each other and recognize some similarities, but their journeys have sadly gone in different directions. They both seem to think that their destinies are set in stone, but wish they could change their actions that put them where they are but knowing that it's probably too late.

While the final episode has not been shown yet, you can't help but wish you could've helped these characters with their fraughtful journeys and prevented what could only be a tragic ending.",literal
"Moments of Power, Lacking Impact I came to A House of Dynamite with high expectations, given Kathryn Bigelow's track record. It's solid, at times gripping, but far from her best.

The movie builds on familiar ground - soldiers under pressure, blurred morality, and the personal cost of conflict - yet this time the pacing feels uneven, and the emotional punch doesn't land as cleanly. John David Washington does strong work, and Riley Keough brings intensity, but the story becomes predictable midway through.

There are flashes of the taut direction and realism that made The Hurt Locker unforgettable, especially in the quieter tension-building scenes. Unfortunately, those moments are surrounded by long stretches that lack urgency.

It's a competent film that never fully catches fire... well-crafted, just not explosive enough.",literal
"Kind of plain, somewhat funny, partially thought-provoking.... 6.2/10 (Recommend)

This film isn't anything special, and it doesn't try to be more than it needs to be. I think the comedy style and how you find the film entirely depends on what your perception of the actors is.

I enjoy Keanu, but he's always rigid when it comes to comedy I find. That perception is probably from seeing him in more action films than comedy. However, the sort of rigid comedy works for him in ""Good Fortune"" because he's playing an angel that has never experienced human hardship it works. As for Aziz Ansari and Seth Rogen, I'm indifferent to them, though I'm more familiar with Seth's work than I am with Aziz. Generally speaking, I don't find either of them to be overly funny, and oftentimes I feel their comedy is forced. However, I did not hate them in this film. The comedy works and I found bits and pieces funny.

The story isn't special, but it still makes you think. You never know what life circumstances others are going through, and so it gives a feeling that you should treat others better and with respect. And this isn't one of those movies where the lowly guy wishes he has the rich guys life and swaps places. No, this is a movie where an angel just wants people to live their best lives, but ends up making things worse than they already are. At least from some perspectives.

Overall, don't expect a grandeur film. It's very simple, and again you might find some parts funny and you might not. The cast is solid enough, and the story is enjoyable. In the end, I do recommend checking this one out. Maybe on a cheap night. I'd see it again, just not in theatres, unless someone was covering my ticket.

That's it for now. Thanks for taking time to read my review. Happy watching and enjoy the show!",literal
"Juvenile gore, bad writing, muddled plot I love horror, especially anything that borrows from Stephen King's source material, but this is just poorly scripted, poorly researched juvenile nonsense.

It's supposed to be set in 1962, but the haircuts, set designs and slang don't accurately reflect the time period. And some of the child actors are okay, but more are abominable (although they might do better if they had decent lines to speak).

I guess it might get better in future but the plot jumps around too much for your engagement to build, plus the pacing is off. The gory car scene where IT gets introduced is obviously intended to be horrifying, but because they stretched it out over six or seven long minutes, all you feel is impatience.",literal
"Fans of Crime Procedurals will enjoy this show! Fans of Crime Procedurals will enjoy this show!

Particularly those who liked shows like Good Girls, Bones, Tru Calling and Sleepy Hollow. Although, this show has no real paranormal aspect to the study like the former two mentioned - the ideals presented are pretty awesome and the comedic relief interlaced between the serious scenes make for moments of levity that carry through well to make for a very enjoyable and entertaining program. I was hooked by episode one and would say it is now in the top favorite new fall shows that I've watched thus far. The way the main character balances out multiple aspects of her neurodivergence, motherhood and a role in a job that actually amplifies her differences to allow her excelling is fantastic to see.",literal
"An overly crowded third magic show about the battle between generations, which becomes somewhat unbalanced. Now You See Me: Now You Don't is the third installment in the Now You See Me film series. This third film is directed by Ruben Fleischer, known for Zombieland and Venom.

When a younger group of illusionists, as a tribute to The Four Horsemen, also engages in robbing people through magical tricks, it catches the attention of Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg). Together with this younger group, he attempts to steal a diamond from Veronika Vanderberg (Rosamund Pike).

However, this diamond turns out to carry a much bigger hidden secret than Atlas had anticipated. This draws the other Horsemen into the heist and the mysteries surrounding the diamond. The old, fractured group must learn to work together again-this time also with a younger generation of illusionists, who often clash due to generational differences.

In this third film, the four original Horsemen are reunited. Isla Fisher was unable to return for the second film because she was pregnant at the time, so it is enjoyable to see the original four together again in a Now You See Me movie. The four still have good chemistry as charismatic illusionists, though in this third installment they must share screen time with the three younger illusionists. As a result, the film can sometimes feel overcrowded, making it occasionally difficult to follow. The tricks are explained, but since multiple tricks require explanation, it can become somewhat lengthy.

In addition to the four illusionists trying to impress each other with their tricks, the two generations also compete to impress one another. It's fun to see how performers with older magical techniques and more modern approaches try to outdo or deceive each other. These tricks are playfully presented through creative use of sets, though sometimes also with visual effects. These effects are occasionally noticeable, which can diminish the sense of magic.

Besides the returning illusionists and the new ones, who mostly remain in the shadow of the originals, the film also features several cameos and additional new characters. Rosamund Pike plays the villain of the story, but her character feels somewhat underdeveloped and has an unclear accent, making it difficult to determine her exact background.",literal
Pretty Good!!! Learning about the actual guy's story is pretty interesting of why they called him the roofman. Channing played his character really well like actually got into character. Kirsten was amazing. Peter was hilarious when he held the cash that had an ink bomb. I didn't know that Juno was in the movie which was shocking.,literal
"Not believable It's fantasy. The soundtrack is completely out of whack for the period and makes it feel contrived.

"Weak remake of a brand new British series I don't get it...

The British series is brand new and still ongoing, so why need a worse American remake? If the series was at least 2-3 decades old, I could maybe understand the reason for a remake.

I don't even want to give the series a try knowing the British one isn't even finished and still running. It's a bit ridiculous there needs to be an American version of a brand new British series. Actually not ridiculous but just really sad...

The only reason why this remake is getting so much attention, is purely because of the advertising.

A seriously washed and watered down American remake.",literal
"Prognosis is bad Molly Parker was the lucky one. She got to have amnesia on the show. Hopefully she remembers it well enough not to do another season.

"Xander Zone Welcome back to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**

Tonight's movie review is xXx (2002), a thrill-seeking adrenaline junkie Xander Cage played by the furious Vin Diesel. After doing a crazy stunt involving a live streaming through a hand-held cam recorder while driving and jumping off a Corvette, xXx as he is known, is caught and given two options - either work for the NSA or go to jail. Of course, he chooses the former and soon gets thrown into the world of espionage and plays as an undercover spy agent within an old Russian military fraction known as Anarchy 99. There are heaps of cliched moments and throwbacks to spy films including the 007 franchise however this film stands alone as the 2000's version of spy meets extreme sports addicts where we see motorbike stunts, skiing during an avalanche, flying out of aeroplanes and heaps more. Some people might arguably say it's a copy of the Bond film but to be honest it's a blend of Bond mixed with the Fast and Furious movies. The filmmakers make use of the slow mo and providing different angles of the action sequences. So if you like the same design as the Fast and Furious flicks - fast car-racing, big, loud, obnoxiously smug cliched lines then this flick is for you.

The plot is basic, Xander Cage breaks into the baddies' inner circle, falls in love, gets found out, then lots of people shoot each other until the film finishes at Cage's desired vacation spot. Some plot sequences didn't make sense - why did Xander snowboard down a mountain to attack a military guarded shack while wearing black?? No one told him about the concept of stealth and evade detection. Also the final chase - a submarine leaves the fortress 5 minutes to exact its Silent Night weapon and said submarine goes 80 miles an hour...so how did Xander catch the subie while he was in a muscle car?

The one liners are cool especially the line of ""things I do for my country"" which humoursly is done when there is a European exotic next the xXx. Samuel L. Jackson is also in this spy flick as Agent Gibbons with a scarred face and his character either laughs, enjoys the opera or makes jokes how it's just a test all the time and the real mission is yet to come - simple routine characterisations. The scene with Agent Toby Shavers as the care package guy showing off his tech and gadgets has its moments including the ""fire in the hole moment."" Cage's trick with the dinner tray is also cool to watch and you know what is else is cool? Cage with his bikes, like who doesn't like watching an exploding flying motorbike shot?? - similar to playing a video game. It is still an enjoyable film which has references to think like a PlayStation video game...overall 6.8/10.",literal

"A Success! Works as the game and as the tv show. That is the goal when adapting a video game. Although not a direct adaptation of any particular game, and instead a new story and characters were created, while staying inside the frame of the franchise, connecting that existing..

Season one wraps, while remains open, intended series and multi season intricate story.

"Fantastic Four: First Steps is a strong addition to the increasingly saturated superhero genre I watched Fantastic Four: First Steps (2025) in theaters this evening. The team faces both good and bad news: the good-Sue Storm is pregnant; the bad-a world-eating cosmic entity is heading to Earth to destroy it... and take their unborn child. Can the Fantastic Four stop the World Eater and his powerful herald before it's too late?

This film is directed by Matt Shakman (WandaVision) and stars Pedro Pascal (The Last of Us), Vanessa Kirby (The Crown), Ebon Moss-Bachrach (The Bear), Julia Garner (Ozark), Joseph Quinn (Stranger Things), and Natasha Lyonne (Poker Face).

I actually preferred this over Superman-you can clearly see the influence of the WandaVision team. They did a fantastic job capturing the era, fleshing out the characters, and designing immersive sets that really draw you into this version of the Marvel universe. The CGI and special effects are elite, and I highly recommend seeing this in 3D if you get the chance.

The casting was spot-on across the board-maybe with the exception of Silver Surfer. As a longtime fan of the character from the comics, the gender swap threw me off at first. That said, the Surfer's powers are portrayed so impressively that it's easy to accept the change. Galactus is done perfectly-he's portrayed as a truly elite villain-and I also loved the inclusion of classic foe The Mole Man. The film does a great job introducing the characters and establishing the stakes. There's a lot to enjoy here.

In conclusion, Fantastic Four: First Steps is a strong addition to the increasingly saturated superhero genre. I'd give it an 8/10 and strongly recommend checking it out.",literal

"Sisu. A Man of Few Words Seeks a Life of Peace After The Hell of War. Finland. Such a gorgeous landscape even when war torn. It's 1944 and a rogue commander now wanders the Laplands looking for gold, oh, that precious and sweet yellow metal. The Second World War is rumbling to a noisy end, and still a reminder that it's there off in the not so far distance and occasionally it's even closer in the air overhead.

This elder and his really cool-looking dog (I want one!) search this ravaged world, just the two of them and a horse as well. Panning for riches.

This is a silent film for the first half hour or so, but where conversation may lack, the beauty of everything else on screen fills in those gaps rather nicely. (You'll think as you watch, I want to visit Finland. I want to live in Finland.) But this is the mid-1940's and there are Nazis being pushed out of the country at the moment and they are losing this war and their death-grip on this land and its' people.

This movie is told in six announced chapters. It's a gloriously short hour and a half. Tarantino's influence is heavy but more so from his Westerns than from Inglorious Basterds as one might think.

The kills are awesome. The fights are realistic and not like the choreographed dance fighting we see in most modern productions these days.

Though there is little dialogue as stated, it is told here in English and there are no subtitles.

The action sequences are breathtaking and hearten back to Raiders of the Lost Ark.

I'm serious!

This is a good story and it is timeless.

A man and his dog want to live comfortably, in peace, and be left alone.

"Just watch it. You will not be disappointed. Just watched the first chapter last night. Everything about it is great, the actors, the writing, the fact that it takes place in the FREAKING 80s (YES!) and all the music. The theme music is completely on point...very John Carpenter-ish with heavy synthesizer sounds that are very menacing. Watch this show, tell your friends to watch. It feels very Stephen King/Steven Spielberg..with some X-Files mixed in. I have never seen the kid actors before but they were all so good. Their on screen chemistry reminded me of the group of friends from The Explorers, Stand By Me or The Goonies but it's definitely not lighthearted or a comedy at all. It's always a good sign that a show is going to be good when you are completely sucked in within the first couple minutes. 10 out of 10 so far.﻿",literal

"This Redial Provides A Decently Strong Connection LIKES: Great Cinema Work The Ambiance of the Music The Homage To A Lot Of Horror Movies The Acting Is Solid Decent Character Development Some Decent Intense Moments The Story is Better Than I Expected Summary: The first movie surprised me with how engaging it was in a simple horror concept. A boy is kidnapped by a serial killer, locked in a basement where the sadistic killer finds thrills in playing with his prey before finishing the deal. When the ghosts of the victim come together to guide him, it's a stretch, but it worked well with the solid direction they took and enough metaphysical concepts to be entertaining but not cheesy. Upon its finale, Black Phone left some questions in my mind, alongside some desires for more character development with this tale. Fortunately, Black Phone 2 does take those limitations and expands upon those elements that I wanted from the first film. There is strong character development that picks up from where we left off, our two heroes now in new phases of their lives as they adapt to the trauma of the first film. Each of them faces their abilities with different struggles, and these plot lines work in tandem to craft a tale that is meaningful, detailed, and surprisingly in sync as they start to establish their place in this odd family. Some intense moments try to help mix things up, adding that exciting level of horror we love in a good scary flick, respecting aspects of the first film, while also incorporating some new abilities that feel in line with the original movie's universe. And the story itself has a few extra elements added, things I enjoyed to expand upon as the Grabber's return sheds some light on his history that helps to add some depth to the psychopath we saw earlier. The expansion still needs some work, but for a sequel, this wasn't too bad a tale in regards to world-building and serving as a canvas for the lead stories.

In regard to production quality, this is where I think Black Phone 2 has some more unique qualities. The trailer showed two different film styles, one using the higher definition cameras for the non-dream sequences, and the other using the older Super 8 film style for Gwen's dream segments. It does a nice job of transitioning between these two, each one helping to enhance the scare tactics and setting, while also helping establish their own story tone that helps to elevate this movie. I liked the fogginess of the dream world as the ""older film"" style managed to add a murky, haze-like quality to the world that offered some false harbor of hope, while also adding that nostalgic retro feel that home movies accomplished so long ago. Meanwhile, the modern-day camera style adds that shiny finish we've grown accustomed to, the new-age technology with a much better capture rate, frame rate, and balance to allow for smoother action elements, which this movie used. What I also found impressive was the nods to other horror films in various ways that ranged from unique camera angles/shots to the very concept of The Grabber's return. Sure, you can say there are some knock-offs present, but the way they were utilized mostly honored those references instead of abusing them, adding those key factors to be entertaining without going too crazy with their use. The soundtrack accomplishes the goal of helping add some flair to the music, not flexing the creative score muscles, but applying the familiar foreboding drums, string instruments, and some other instruments there to provide that extra ounce of jolt to help with the scares. As for the acting, I was quite impressed with the cast of characters handling the sequel with similar levels of efficiency. I won't go into too much detail, but the cast has quite a spread to handle between character growth from the last film's issues and facing the threat that has emerged. Solid chemistry with well-balanced acting qualms lends to a great chemistry that seldom drops into overdramatic theatrics, accustomed to this genre.

DISLIKES: Still Some Plot Gaps A Few Characters Underutilized Some Extra Scares Does Need A Bit More Tension/Less Talking Some Rule Bending That Feels A Bit Too Cheesy Summary: Despite many elements I enjoyed, Black Phone 2 still runs into the trend of generating a lot more ideas/questions than fully fleshing everything out. The plot does shine light on a few elements as they push their way forward into a new future, but during the course digs up several key story elements that now suggest potential sequels to dive into. Opportunities were provided to explore those questions further, but the movie gets a bit lost in the inspirational elements that these elements get dumped for later use. The new characters added to this film are okay, but their use is inconsistent, and most feel very bland that their inclusion would have been better substituted with a smaller cast trying to solve the case. Or if not more information, then more of a challenge by this film's boogeyman as he tries to stop them from ruining whatever scheme he has cooked up. Black Phone 2 provides a setting where a lot of scares could have been created to keep us on our toes, provide a challenge, and maintain the thriller vibe I love in my horror movies. Yet, the film focuses more on shock factor than true scares, and much of the madness has been shown in the various trailers to once more ruin the surprise. I'll agree with the other reviewers that the film does have some good dialogue, but I felt at times the movie took too much liberty with it, and this slowed down the pace and limited the exciting elements. Only the fact of good delivery and engaging characters helps to buffer out some of the inefficient dialogue, but that may not be enough for some people to justify the word-heavy movie. My biggest peeve is directed toward is some of the rule-breaking they do in this film. I can't say much, but near the end, Black Phone 2 tries to be metaphorical and symbolic to show the character growth hitting its peak; however, in doing so, it turns into some cheesy conveniences that become silly in how much it dissolves the stakes. It needed to veer a bit more from the Freddy 3 elements and try to find just a bit more control in these newfound strengths that we see wielded on the screen.

The VERDICT: I enjoyed The Black Phone 2, and I find that, for a sequel, it accomplished a lot of things that most sequels fall short of. Although the camera style may not be for everyone, I think many will enjoy the clever way it divides the movie's realities into clear and understandable segments. It's a smartly shot film that is supported by a great setting and soundtrack, with some wonderful settings that served as another terrifying playground to have ""fun"" in. With some great acting, decent character development, and some good moments of thrilling mystery and drama that help serve the narrative well. However, the movie's scare elements felt a bit simplified or lackluster, given how menacing The Grabber is. There was so much more potential to mess around with, but I felt it got shuffled by poor character utilization, dialogue-heavy sequences, and a bit more focus on those dramatic moments. And while not the worst storytelling, the fact that we still have a lot of questions to answer, alongside a potential opening for another sequel, frustrated me that we still have to rely on another movie to answer things that could have been resolved in this movie. When I factor all this together, I think that Black Phone 2 is quite worth a trip to the theater for many elements that serve as a good Halloween movie. My scores for this film are: Horror/Slasher: 7.5-8.0 Movie Overall: 7.0.",figurative
"All an Imitation of Heaven Can Endure ""Magnificent Obsession"" is Douglas Sirk's rehearsal for ""All That Heaven Allows"" and ""Imitation of Life."" The story (from Lloyd Douglas' novel) is a ludicrous drug-store romance with a smarmy tinge of Woolworth spirituality that DARES you not to take all this seriously.

Through a series of unintentionally tragi-comic coincidences, Rock Hudson gamely goes from rich bad selfish playboy to -- what else? -- selfless neurosurgeon who saves the sight and life of the comatose woman he loves, eight years his senior.

Oh, for the days when doctors and patients offered each other cigarettes in their offices: When even small out-of-the-way hospitals out West were staffed with full orchestras and choirs stationed just outside OR.

The actors are fine. Particularly Wyman and Moorehead, who somehow make their impossible lines sound genuine. Sirk's direction, design and cinematography are, as usual, outstanding. But the script is insurmountable.

One tries and tries to go with the implied emotions of these contrived situations, but succumbs to chuckling disbelief with every ham-handed twist.

Thankfully, all was redeemed just one year later, when the major players returned in the superlative, ""All That Heaven Allows."" Followed, four years after THAT, by Sirk's incomparable masterpiece of the genre, ""Imitation of Life.""",figurative

"An evolution in entertainment and awareness... Just like every other series ever presented, Law and Order evolved from 'just another crime show', into what I consider to be the number one College of Law...

Early on the series was almost blah while they found their wings; as far as I'm concerned, Michael Moriarty was horribly miscast and his performances showed that. But when Sam Waterston took over the role as assistant DA things got really good...

From the Police standpoint, it was worse; until they found a couple of actors who could project real emotion in their characters; Jerry Orbach stands out as the prime character in the 27th, with only S. Epatha Merkerson Taking top honors as the Lieutenant of the precinct...

The show was outstanding after they settled down into a more real premise, that you don't always win, and that police and DA's are real people too; with emotions and hardships to deal with...

"Breath of fresh air with a very familiar flavor. Caitlin is phenomenal in the role and it's a fun, interesting, well written and well acted series. But for those who watch police procedurals/Comedy/dramas you start to get a feeling of Deja vu as each new episode airs. There is a sense of familiar comfort and an ease of understanding the characters and their back stories. Except the series I'm familiar with the main characters are reversed. In High Potential the woman is Castle and the man is Beckett. She enters the precinct lives after displaying amazing observational skills. Castle entered the precinct after several murders copied his books and his observations help solve the crimes. Detective Beckett doesn't want Castle there and Detective Karadec doesn't want Morgan. But both precinct captains do. They both get on each others nerves yet an easy peace and acceptance starts to take hold as the series progresses. High Potential is still in its early stages so there is no evidence of any romantic entanglements yet. But surely it will appear. Beckett had a back story...... her mother. Morgan has a missing man. Castle had the two sidekick detectives. High Profile has two sidekick detectives. Castle had 'The Box'. High Profile has the same interview room. Castle follows Beckett around. Morgan follows Karadec. I watch the credits after HP ends looking for familiar names of writers or producers from Castle. The shows are that similar to each other. Each episode they learn a little more about each other. They call each other by their last names. Each series comes up with at least three suspects before finding the right one in the nick of time. Castle has Alexis and suffers through her growing pains. Morgan has Ava and hers. Both series show the characters doing things no police department would ever allow from breaking the chain of evidence to allowing civilians to interrogate suspects and many other activities all for the advancement of the story line. Both series depend on civilians to solve crimes that experienced professionals apparently can't do on their own. HP is a very good series, but it's almost a carbon copy of Castle. Hopefully it will gain an identity of its own as it progresses.",figurative

In the case of Playdate I turned it off before Alan Ritchson appeared, but I read the reviews, gobsmacked by how terrible Kevin James was and is only to find out it got better when Ritchson appeared. Meh, it did improve, but I have no answer why anyone would invest time or money in any Kevin James vehicle.",literal
Enjoyable but.... The one real issue i have with the show is that it doesn't do a great job of distinguishing between current and flashback scenes.,literal
"Ambitious but disappointing Now before I begin, I want to say I enjoyed Chris Stuckmann's critic videos and works in the past. Having seen his reviews and talks about his upbringings in the vile Jehovah Witnesses cult was interesting. He seems like a chill person. Now for his first debut feature film, there are some good aspects, yet also not so great aspects.

Starters, the atmosphere and presentation is pretty good. With the tones of supernatural, mystery, found footage style and blended with paranoia themes, it helps add layers of tension within the setting and concept. Alongside with some solid special effects, production designs and camera work, there are some genuinely good moments of creepy sequences, atmospheres within the setting, and the colors too. Stuckmann's direction is decent, as he was able to capture the essence of the themes and balances pretty well. Alright admittedly, there are some direction chops that didn't land very well.

The performances are pretty solid. Camille Sullivan was really good, alongside with the rest of the cast members too. Unfortunately, the writing and execution causes the movie to prevent it from being good. First of all, the story and concept is good and the writing does offer some unique and fun horror ideas. But the issues is that it feels like Stuckmann struggles to blend the writing perfectly with what he wants to present. Because of that, the writing demonstrates a lot of horror cliches that are predictable and moments that feel messy. Which makes the characters of the movie hard to believe in nor engage.

Alongside with some annoying jump scares, the dialogue does feel wonky. As if the dialogue feels like something of a student film project does. On the effects, there are some good animal and blood effects, including sound designs. And the pacing is pretty solid.

At the end, I'm happy Chris Stuckmann is able to finally make his movie. He has talent for sure and I do like to see where he leads next. But, he really needs to get a better writer.",literal
"Best xXx Vin Diesel oozes style and bad assness as Zander Cage pro underground athlete whose is recruited by Samual l. Jackson for the NSA xXx Program of which he is the first recruit he is sent to Russia to stop a Russian terrorist organization.

There are a lot of cool action scenes good cinematography and the music is rather earlier 2000's music but it is a good action movie one of the best 2000's action spy flicks with lots of explosions and cool cars. 7.5 / 10 give it a go.",literal
"A Stressful Watch This film had lots of potential. A reliable cast, some great direction, a story that works for the most part. Where does it fail? The pacing is a major issue and so is the resolution. The film is also just not very enjoyable. It's dark and unrelentingly depressing. Just when you think you find a bright spot for the main character, the film hits her with another issue. It made for a very stressful and tedious watch.

We'll start by praising Rose Byrne. A fantastic actress that puts on quite a show here. The majority of the film is her character dealing with her own depression and trying to keep her life afloat at the same time. Through her character, she accurately depicts the chaos of being a parent without a partner. Some very compelling work that I applaud her for. A daring role to say the least. Conan O'Brian does a nice job as well, without slouching into his usual schtick. I could see him doing well in future serious roles if he chose to do so.

The direction was also slick. I just wished the director chose a brighter color pallette to throw off the depressing nature that permeates much of the film. Otherwise, this was a competently made film. Reminded me a lot of the Safdie bros films, and makes sense considering one of them helped produce it.

My biggest issue with the film is the pacing. There were a few things that could have been cut out of the film and a few scenes that needed trimming. The film kept me with it, but just barely. Truthfully, it could've sped things up a bit at no consequence to the plot.

There's also the issue of the general oppressive feel of the entire film. It made for a stressful and unpleasant watch. I'm sure that was part of the director's point, but I also come to the movies to be entertained. I didn't find this one bit entertaining. It made me want to cry and shell myself off from the world.

Overall, I recommend it based on it's strong performances and the brilliant depiction of a mother on the brink of insanity. However, if you are not a fan of extremely depressing dramas, or stressful cinema, I would recommend waiting for streaming. It's quite a dousy in both of those departments.

"My favorite show since 2017 I don't understand how some people don't like it. The fact that some people said ""Too long wait for season 4"" and gave 1 star like did y'all forget about covid pandemic? That was the reason we had to wait so long. But sure it may be not for everyone and is more for like teens but mostly everything in the show was really good. The acting, the cast, story. I just loved everything in stranger things and I'll never change my mind.",literal
"Modern day dating I went into this movie having the lowest expectations possible. I hadn't heard many good things about it and I'm typically not a Dakota Johnson fan.

I have to say this movie took me by surprise. I honestly think anyone who isn't giving this moving a good review has not experienced modern day dating and the just how awful it is. The expectations, the disappointment, the resentment, the feeling of giving up and losing all fate. This is all shown in this movie so well.

It also hits at the topic of just how much we put ourselves and our safety out there these days all to try and find the right person. Dating can be fun but it is also a huge risk especially to females.

I think anyone watching this movie and is in a long term relationship and doesn't enjoy the movie needs to take a good hard look at their relationship and be so glad for what they have. It will make you remember why you're with your partner and what drew you to them in the first place.

A pleasant surprise which I am glad of because I loved past lives! I will be looking forward to what Celine song brings next!",literal
"Depressing I really wanted to like this movie, but it's not what I was expecting for.

It's a heavy, dramatic and not well written movie, that had a really good potential.

I don't know why they promoted it like it's a nice rom-com when it's clearly not.

I wish they gave more depth to the characters.

Depressing.",literal
"5 stars is fair enough I mean, as he's a new director, I think it's not too bad, For me, the biggest issues with this film lie in its pacing and narrative structure. The shift from the female lead being deeply terrified after visiting the prison to suddenly going to an amusement park feels abrupt and unintentionally comedic. It makes the protagonist's night seem oddly busy, which broke the immersion for many viewers.

The storytelling approach also comes across as rather chaotic. The mix of found-footage style with a more traditional cinematic language could have been handled in a more cohesive and effective way. As a horror fan, I also felt the scare design was lacking. Just when the tension built up and I was prepared for a scare, the film would cut away too quickly. The ending left me feeling unsatisfied.

Overall, the scare sequences weren't creative enough and didn't bring any fresh ideas to make the film truly stand out.",literal
"Awesome! To make sure you know how good this movie is, I'll tell you my demographic. I'm a 41 yo, white, and conservative. The only reason I had to throw that out there is there's some ahole out there that's assuming the good reviews are strictly bc its a primarily black led cast. I'm here to tell those people to shut up and watch this movie. Michael B Jordan is quickly becoming this generation's denzel....he's phenomenal in this movie. Every actor/actress was too. I'm a vampire kinda guy so this is right up my alley. The crazy thing is that, if there were no vampires, this would still be a good movie. The historical Jim Crowe era storyline and the two gangster twins and the mob back story was good on its own. Throw in vampires.....just take my money! It takes a while to introduce the vampires, but its worth it. I'm not gonna spoil the plot at all, cuz im not an ahole, but its just plain good from start to finish. I will give a piece of advice though, stay for the credits! I didn't the first time around, but when I saw it again I did. In closing, if you like old timey gangsters and vampires, all wrapped up in a really good movie....you better see this! Probably in my top 3 of favorite vampire movies ever! I can't give it enough praise! Also, don't wanna forget Coogler.....tremendous job!",literal
"I don't want this ... for a reason Am I the only one who feels that the chemistry between the main characters.gets less and less as the show goes on? I love both Kristen Bell and Adam Brody but at times I wanted to shout out loud: Nobody wants this for a reason! Apart from that I absolutely loved the idea and the execution of the show. The supporting actors do a great job as well, especially the portrayal of Sasha, Esther, Morgan and Bina are fantastic. Speaking of Morgan and Joanne - I was hoping for a major plot twist that didn't happen in this season. Looking forward to a second one just to see whether this show will turn out to be more than your average love story with a foreseeable happy ending.",literal
Nobody but hes actually a nobody This is basically the first film without the heart and emotion just pure violence punches kicks stabs gun shots and i like it fpr that but what made the original great was that emotion that family aspect of the original made it grat still ut has the positives of the original nobody just without the heart and emotion aswell as the villains sucked we have like travis marshall bro and i cant remember any of the villains names for the life of me.,literal
Just What TV Needs The show humanizes the life of a everyday public servant who is just trying to make it the best way they know how. Dealing with the most random people going through the inconvenience of going through the DMV is truly depicted greatly. I work in the human resources field and trust me there job seems like a nightmare compared to my everyday experiences.,literal
"very good Didn't know what to expect from fallout tv adaptation, and after finally watched it, can with satisfaction say that it's very good. Lots of good stuff in the show, and quite some excellent. It is nice that we got a military grunt wanna be hero, instead of actual ""all capable"" cliche. Also excellent is that Lucy turned out all that nowdays is hard to even expect, let alone actually get on TV.

Good characters, and the Ghoul is excellent. Good plot for the season, very game alike. And very good story that we only scratched the surface of in S1. Really looking forward to S2.",literal
"Easy and educational They just performed a procedure that saved a life. Having lost a friend to the disease they cured, I immediately checked online and found the first cure had actually just happened about the time they aired this. So I have to say good job being relevant and drawing attention to something that kills a lot of people!

The dummies comparing it to House are just dumb. It is slow moving, low impact. That is ok for a change. Keeps my beloved dog from getting spazzed out!

I gave it a 10 not because it is a 10, just to help offset the 75% dummies out there. Comparing this show to House is about like comparing Bones to Castle.",literal
"Yet another sad sad attempt by Hollywood to revise history Well made? Yes. Well acted? Yes, all around. Entertaining? Yes... when it's not over-working itself to be socially woke. What bother me about this series is it tries tooo hard to create storylines that just aren't true. If Murphy wants to delve into true-life crime then he needs to work on not taking such EXCESSIVE liberties, especially when choosing someone who is so well documented.

There are so many inconsistencies to the truth here. I understand peppering a narrative with some extra drama to keep it interesting but this is beyond that to me. By the 7th or so episode it just got to be too much, although I did finish the series. The most compelling episode to me was the episode with Tony. Its a shame more time was not spent on the victims.

I believe real true-crime fans would have preferred a more realistic approach to this story. If you want to embellish I to this extent, create your own serial killer and base him off Dahmer. Oh and stop with the time jumping, in this case it did you zero favors and made very little impact to the story.",literal
"It's not Dr. Seuss' Grinch, it's Jim Carrey's I guess this movie is OK if you forget about the original and just go with the new one as if it were not a remake. My kids seemed to enjoy it but I just didn't. I tried to like the Grinch but it just didn't make any sense. 

***SPOILERS AHEAD*** They try to explain why he hates Christmas but even before anything malicious or cruel happens to him, we see him as an infant, bumping another infant out of the way, Then, as a baby, devouring a Santa plate with relish, then again as a small child drawing terrible things happening to Santa (which would of course, ruin Christmas for everyone) while he chuckles with glee to himself. In the book and cartoon, the motivation for why he acted and behaved deviously was never introduced so we never questioned it. But since this movie introduces the motivation, at least they could be consistent in the answer. But all they succeed in doing is showing him acting like a Grinch before he even becomes ""The Grinch"". 

When his heart grows, the Grinch goes into ridiculous contorted fits of pain and anguish, having the effect of ruining what could and should have been the most touching part of the entire film. At the end, when the townspeople finally accept him, he is still mugging and leering and just being a nuisance. ***END SPOILERS*** 

In the cartoon and the book (I know, I'm comparing...and that's where this movie comes up short), we end up liking the Grinch and accepting him. There is no motivation in this movie for anything like that and when we see others show affection for him, e.g., Cindy and Martha, there really is no explanation as to why...it's just in the script I guess. Come to think of it, the only people in the movie that I cared for at all were Cindy and the dog Max. Aren't there any likable people in Whoville? They look scary and act kind of mean.

The set design was great though, although I found all the make-up distracting and I actually think it would have been better without all the makeup, even for the Grinch character. Jim Carrey has proved that he can do facial contortions, and the audience has the ability to use their imaginations, I think all those layers of makeup were just too much. Give some credit to the audience, we have imaginations too and we would most likely fill in wherever the overdone special effects were lacking but there was no need to do so. No need for imagination at all...everything was done already, whether we liked it that way or not. It could have been a great film, and maybe it is for some people, but I'm not one for all the glitz. Some humanity for the Grinch, especially at the ending would have been nice.",literal
Best Steven show since peaky blinders Really fun! Succession storylines between dysfunctional families are always fascinating to watch. Anthony boyle is by far the best thing about the show. Louis partridge impressed me with a range i didn't know he had and his and anthony's brotherly chemistry was great. James norton was aura farming the entire time and i had no qualms about it. Hope it gets renewed for a season 2.,literal
"Absolutely Fabulous Slice of Life - And Death I have watched all 9 episodes so far and can't get enough. I became intrigued with the concept while watching a Laura Linney interview on The Daily Show. It's often funny, sometimes hilarious, often sad, and sometimes downright heartwrenching. The characters are quirky, conflicted, don't know how to express their feelings, and are frequently nasty, self-involved, and make mistakes, while also being caring, noble, and giving, just like real people. The show takes a sensitive and difficult subject that is usually not discussed, and deals with it using a large dose of humor and the occasional portion of pathos.

Laura Linney's character has spent her life doing what everyone else has expected her to do, and hasn't a clue who she wants to be. She decides to try and figure that out before it's too late. I understand her desire to keep her disease a secret so that she gets to live as much as possible before she dies. She could ""buy"" the attention and understanding of her husband, son, brother, and others she cares about if she tells them about the cancer. However, then she would not only be surrounded by sadness and despair for her remaining days, she'd be suffocated and everyone would assume the cancer is the cause of her behavior when in reality it is merely the catalyst.

I watch a lot of shows that I like, and many that make me laugh; but few touch me as this show has. Sometimes the image in the mirror isn't the prettiest person in all the land, but this is about learning to be comfortable with - even love - what we see. To do that, we first have to see the true image, not the one we think we should see or the one we wish we saw.",literal
"Finally! A good spy series - by the Brits, of course! I watched this because I'd been watching foreign series and was tired of subtitles. So glad I did!

Great cast of true characters - Gary Oldman - you can't go wrong with him. And same with all the rest. Finally a series that isn't polished and pretty, but it has a lot of grit and history.

Binged all of Season 1 in one evening. Am anxious for Season 2.

Something interesting to look forward to!!",figurative
"foreshadowing If they say it, it will happen.

This ""foreshadowing"" becomes a crutch for ""irony"", and somehow discredits several brilliant scenes in an otherwise cinematic gem. The execution is there, but the writing is lame and the power dynamics are incredibly inconsistent.

This vampire just survived all day fleeing from the Choktaw, and finally finds refuge at night? The weakness of the vampires when they ""overwhelm"" the protagonists? There are so many details that could actually make sense in order for this 'missed layup' to be considered worthwhile.

I'm okay with the frustrating flaws of human nature that are crucial to every horror storyline, but even comic books demonstrate consistency of character.",figurative
"I want to love this show, but... Everything about this is good- but Scott Wolf's ridiculous character ruins this show. The antagonist role is poorly written and hyper-transparent. It ruins every episode. It is too bad. This could be good. The Dr. Maitra character is also one-sided, childish and petty. Those two ruin each episode. How can the writers have such good material and then be lazy with the antagonist characters?

Either the Wolf character arc will resolve quickly or viewers will get sick of this and tune out. The rest of the cast and characters are great. Again, too bad that an otherwise good show had to be written like that.",literal
"Noticeably weaker but still fun sequel Even if it's nowhere near as good as the original, Nobody 2 is a fun sequel that plays it very safe by repeating the exact same plot beats and scenarios in a similarly fast paced run time. There's some stuff about fathers wanting their sons to be better than them to add a small amount of heart to proceedings and keep things going in between all the action, which culminates in an inventive Home Alone style siege at a theme park.

Bob Odenkirk continues to be a surprisingly capable action star who has only gotten more committed to the physicality. He balances the rage of Hutch with a likeable yet downbeat nature as he tries to do the right thing. It's nice to see Connie Nielsen getting more to do this time, Christopher Lloyd & RZA both make a welcome return and get the best moments. Unfortunately, Sharon Stone is kinda bad despite clearly having fun being the big bad.

Timo Tjahjanto's direction fully commits to the colourful summer aesthetic to give this instalment a style of its own. The action sequences are generally less impressive thanks to shakier camerawork but they are still well choreographed and executed in a suitably crunchy, bloody fashion where Callan Green's chaotic cinematography pulls off some cool maneuvers. The soundtrack remains a self aware highlight as well.",literal
"Cringy ""Buddy Pic"" AT best All of the trite formula of the finest Hallmark Channel movie comes to life in a Predator vehicle. Elle Fanning, cute but so annoying in this role, & the main character with all his daddy issues in tow was simply insufferable and unimagnitive. It all wraps itself up in a tight little clean package at the end and all is well with the universe? I should have done my homework before buying tickets. Save yourself its not to late.",literal
"Season 4: Well Here's Another Show That Needs to Be SMOKED! Cannot blame the actors on this one, Saul, Mike and Gus have always been interesting characters, but the writers are dragging out the storyline like a slow moving fishing trawler, afraid they'll reach the ""Breaking"" point of no return. Really how many times are we going to see Saul sell phones from the back of his car. Poor Kim, trapped in a mesh mash of meaningless scripts. whats she doing, wheres she going, I don't really know? Time to drag this one in, there's nothing on the line...",literal
"Big, Splashy, Extraordinarily Dull. How to sum up this expensive soap opera? If you can sit through it without either falling asleep or laughing, you're the kind of person who needn't ask for an anaesthetic before your next root canal. I mean -- there is such a thing as going too far, and they have gone it.

The photography is splendid -- Big Bear and Arrowhead Lake -- in glorious 1950s Technicolor overreach. The lighting is flat, as it was in the television productions of the period, such as ""I Love Lucy."" The acting is magnificently abominable. Rock Hundson as a reckless multi-millionaire who believes that, if there is trouble, writing a check for a large amount will make it go away, simply doesn't do the job. He's very handsome at the beginning as a self-testing speedboat racer but was unconvincing. Then, having grievously wounded Jane Wyman, he suffers an unanticipated road to Damascus experience. His reformed playboy is even worse.

Nobody stands out. Otto Kruger is always reliable, whether a suave villain or, as here, an understanding and tolerant mentor to Hudson's emotional life. However, he's knee-capped by a stereotypical part -- the sensitive non-materialistic artist -- and it thereby turned into a figure with the animation of a statue in Disneyland's animatronic Hall of Presidents. Maybe Calvin Cooledge.

The music is full of heavenly choirs, a sure sign that democracy is failing. The nobility of Beethoven's Ninth, already overused, is mutilated by a thousand and one throbbing vocal chords.

I realize Douglas Sirk directed this and that he has a cult following. I don't know why.",literal
"a swapper angel The genre of angel movies is not very prolific, but it includes some memorable creations. The same can be said about the genre of identity swapping films. Actor, stand-up comedian and television creator Aziz Ansari chose to combine the two genres for 'Good Fortune' - his feature film debut for the big screens, for which he wrote the script directed and played one of the main roles. He added a serious dose of sentiment and warmth, managed to gather an interesting cast around him and the result is more than satisfactory despite some drops in pace and some repetitions, perhaps inevitable considering that it is still a debut film.

Gabriel is an angel of the 2nd rank in the angelic hierarchy, that is, one with minor tasks. He looks a bit like Lieutenant Columbo, sloppy and dressed in a shabby trench coat, and his job is to save from accidents drivers who text while driving. He also dreams of more important missions, and when the path to promotion seems closed, he decides to go beyond his duties and intervene to save the life of one of the human beings he had helped. This is Arj, an aspiring screenwriter who, while waiting for his film career to happen, barely survives, constantly looking for temporary jobs (deliveries, housework, cashier, etc.) in the gig industry. One of these jobs introduces him to the ultra-rich Jeff, who lives a luxurious life from investments and stock market speculations, and is also the owner of a huge and magnificent villa. Gabriel, wanting to prove to Arj - who is haunted by the thought of suicide - that life is worth living, proposes a temporary identity swap with Jeff. The goal would be for Arj to understand that the rich have their problems too and that a more modest life also has its meaning through the achievements that one reaches by himself and through the opportunity to meet real people and even to fall in love. The problem is that if money doesn't solve all of Arj's problems, it solves most of them, and he refuses to return to his previous life. On the other hand, Seth, thrown into Arj's difficult life, is frustrated and wants his identity back. For all this mess, Gabriel too is at risk to be fired, which means that from the world of angels he is falling into becoming a simple and mortal man, one who can enjoy a burger and a cigarette.

The idea is nice, but not enough to support the entire film. Almost everything I've described happens in the first 15 minutes, and the rest are variations on the same theme, some cute and funny, others predictable, especially when the moralizing ideas are transformed into verbosity and not into jokes. The criticism of social differences and the temporary job industry is obvious. The film's chance lies in the quality of the actors' acting. Keanu Reeves, who has the reputation of being a kind of socially involved angel himself outside of his acting career, fits perfectly into the role of Gabriel and the scenes of the discovery and addictive adoption of the small pleasures of human life are delicious. Aziz Ansari is himself a talented actor, who builds or plays his own character with empathy and warmth. The trio is completed by Seth Rogen. I'm not a fan of this actor and I didn't become one after seeing this film, but the role of Jeff suits him. 'Good Fortune' is a comedy of the kind that used to be made in Hollywood, with a controlled naivety and full of good intentions, a little diluted and yet enjoyable. Kind of like a slightly too-big slice of bread spread with too little jam and butter, and still tasty enough.",literal
"I hardly know her. I think the problem I'm having when it comes to the filmography of Oz Perkins is that the first film of his I saw was 'Longlegs (2024)', which basically set my expectations too high for his upcoming work. I don't think I'm diminishing the genuine success of that enigmatic movie when I say that maybe Perkins isn't quite the filmmaker you'd think he is if you've only seen that picture. Striking gold by random doesn't mean you haven't struck gold, but it does mean you'll probably have a harder time doing it again... at least on purpose. The director's latest, 'Keeper (2025)', is a very different flavour to his other effort from this year, 'The Monkey (2025)', but is probably just about as enjoyable for different reasons. It's much more serious and sinister, essentially a surreal haunted house story with some bemusing absurdism but generally no sense of humour. Even at only around a hundred minutes, it still feels a bit too long because it basically boils down to a relatively slow buildup of strange occurrences that culminate in a finale focused almost entirely around an exposition dump that explains too much (or, at least, too obviously) and not enough all at once. Despite this, the creepy imagery and committed central performance keep you invested in the affair, and its willingness to be straight-up strange without winking at its audience is also fairly commendable. It's all a little bit random, and there's no real way the audience would be able to guess the specifics of what's going on, but its bizarreness is at the very least interesting even if it isn't in service of a greater theme or, even, particular concept. The writing is a little clumsy at times, and it falls into the same traps as many of its inspirations, but it's mysterious enough to keep you engaged for the majority of the runtime. The direction isn't anything special, but it's sturdy - and, even, confident - enough to provide more than a few enjoyable frights while remaining relatively restrained and keeping things feeling quite claustrophobic. The flick, in general, is very generic, yet relatively well-achieved. It doesn't really say anything, but it's just about stylish enough that its lack of substance isn't especially bothersome. It's a decent effort, even though it's ultimately fairly forgettable.",literal
"It's Not About Loving LA - It's About Surviving It."" I Love LA"" isn't just about Los Angeles - it's about what it does to people.

From the very first scene, you feel the chaos of chasing dreams in a city that pretends to care. Rachel Sennott plays Maia like she's holding it all together - until she's not. It's funny, messy, and painfully real in that ""I know someone like her"" kind of way.

What really hit me is how the show doesn't glamorize LA. There's no golden sunset pretending everything's fine. It's Instagram-perfect on the surface, but beneath that - loneliness, ambition, and confusion mix like smog and neon lights.

The writing is sharp, almost cruel at times, but it never feels fake. You laugh one second and feel completely crushed the next. That's the magic of good storytelling - it sneaks up on you.

Rachel Sennott's performance is electric - she turns every breakdown into art. You can't look away.

""I Love LA"" is a love letter and a breakup note to the same city - and honestly, I kind of loved every second of that contradiction.

Final thought: It's not about loving LA. It's about surviving it.

"Hitting viewers with flashback less than 15 minutes into the first episode is a dealbreaker. Nope. You haven't even properly introduced the protagonist and you're already dumping us into flashbacks? Just terrible and an immediate dealbreaker. I'm tired of movies and TV shows repeatedly taking viewers out of the moment and ruining their own pacing.

They are tedious, lazy crutches for poor writing and characterization. Same goes for dream sequences. Won't hang around long enough to see if there are any of the latter.

Other than that, the lead actor doesn't seem to have any real charisma or presence on screen and felt like he was out of his depth. There's really no reason to watch this unless you have literally nothing else going on.",literal
"Gathering of the Griswold clan for Christmas is dangerously funny... Chevy Chase lends his abundant comic talents to a tale where everything that could possibly go wrong does, while preparing his house for a gathering of the Griswold clan for a typical American Christmas. He goes overboard, believing that he's about to receive a nice Christmas bonus. The nerve-wracking turn of events that follow are enough to create havoc when he almost suffers a nervous breakdown before a happy ending.

Lots of sight gags enliven a cheerful script by John Hughes, many having to do with the lights going up all over the housetop and walls as our hero prepares to illuminate the neighborhood with lights and music. Naturally, almost every attempt fails until someone accidentally turns on the main switch.

Funniest moments come after the arrival of Cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid) who really gets into the spirit of the farce with an engaging hillbilly performance as the head of a family of rednecks. Doris Roberts and E.G. Marshall add their own bits of amusement and a senile granny, played by the woman who voiced Betty Boop, offers her own brand of clownish behavior.

Summing up: Could have been better, but brightens the holiday mood with some shenanigans about eccentric relatives that just about anyone can relate to.

Chevy Chase, as the fumbling and enthusiastic do-gooder, takes the Scrooge out of Christmas with some very entertaining, if somewhat improbable over-the-top antics and Beverly D'Angelo is charming and patient as his long-suffering wife.",literal
"The Power of Lawrence The film was compelling, though not always the easiest watch. It was fascinating to witness two A-list actors navigating an emotionally intense narrative under Lynne Ramsay's direction. At times, it evoked subtle echoes of Revolutionary Road, but with a more artful approach, delving into the post-birth trauma that many women and couples experience.

The standout reason to watch this film is undoubtedly Jennifer Lawrence. She delivers a performance of extraordinary depth, easily ranking among her finest work to date. Lawrence takes the audience on an emotional rollercoaster, offering a raw and intimate glimpse into the deepest corners of her character's soul-truly impressive.

Robert Pattinson also gives a solid performance, though he occasionally struggles to match Lawrence's intensity. There are moments, particularly when his character approaches a breakdown or is pushed to his limits by Grace, where his performance can feel slightly heightened.

Good to see Sissy Spacek and Nick Nolte in minor roles. I wished there was more of Nolte. Lakeith Stanfield however was criminally underrated. I dont even remember if he spoke a word in this.

The soundtrack is strong and complements the film's heavy, challenging subject matter. Overall, this is a thought-provoking, emotionally charged watch, anchored by Lawrence's remarkable performance.",figurative
"Good, but not the masterpiece everyone claims Sentimental Values has been praised left and right as a masterpiece, but for me it lands more in the category of ""good, but not great."" It's beautifully made, with a strong pace, a well-crafted script and strong acting, giving the story authenticity and emotional weight from beginning to end.

One thing I really appreciated is that the film never feels over-explanatory. It trusts the audience to think, to connect what was said earlier with what's happening later, and to piece things together on their own. That kind of narrative confidence is rare, and it makes the film feel smart without being showy.

The film is also filled with references. Some subtle, some more obvious, that adds an extra layer for those who like to dissect details. It rewards attentive viewers, though at times it felt like the references were more about signaling cleverness than adding actual value to the story.

And yet, when it was over, I wasn't left with much. Despite having a personal connection to the father-child themes it explores, it didn't resonate with me in the way I expected. The structure is clever, the craft is solid, the references are plentiful, but the emotional impact fell short for me.

In the end, Sentimental Values is a finely built film with a lot of strengths, and it's certainly worth watching. But calling it a masterpiece feels like overselling it, at least from where I'm sitting.",figurative
"Jenna Ortega is exceptional so is the directing Perfectly morbid, superb acting throughout and smooth! I enjoy anything with Jenna Ortega is quite talented and she's great as Wednesday based on Adam's Family. Tim Burton is masterful at weird/intriguing characters that are excellent to watch. The bulk of the time I use other services, this is a perfect reason to use Netflix. I love that this is focused on young folks, anything bizarre and beautiful 4K quality colors. Quite surprise form Tim Burton a lot of his projects didn't have much horror, mostly Sci-Fi, adventure, and drama. Wednesday is a pleasant surprise after all the promotions I've seen I highly recommend it!",literal
"Incredible so far! I am about halfway through the series and am enjoying it very much. A retired engineer, Charles played by Ted Danson is hired by a detective agency to be their ""man on the inside"" in a retirement community where he is to find information on possible thefts. Of course what he finds is a lively community of older adults who are bored, lonely, sometimes forgotten and often in dramas of their own. While the series does take on the common problems of aging seriously, it has a light touch and the mystery is besides the point. The cast made from veteran character actors is excellent. I hope they renew it.",figurative
"Four Stars for the Style and Sets But that's it. Writing so contrived I didn't make it to the end of the first episode. Some of the actors already seeming quite poor (those outside the family) and the modern music just didn't work for me. Trying too hard to be a Peaky Blinders reboot but missing the mark.

I'll keep an eye on other reviews and if others rate it, I might try again.",literal
"Entertaining Show 15 years , 327 so only jumping if you have a lot of spare time on your hands.

It has its ups and downs, ignore all the controversy around the external things, just make your own judgement, it sets a high bar which some episodes didn't reach, it made mistakes, it's perceived as a show that would appeal to women because the leads are good looking. They are, but it's not, it's unique in being one of the increasingly few shows that portray relationships between sibling brothers who are straight white men who can and do show they love for each other in the most extreme ways, it brings in an extended cast to help carry the load as time goes on who are likable, some storylines crash and burn , other soar, but there something for everyone to enjoy.

It's well made, fans of cinematography will be able to luxuriate in the amazing lighting, direction, the sets are second to non and Canada officers her own take on America's back roads that whilst not authentic, give an atmospheric feel. Just sit back and enjoy the ride.",figurative
"n a nutshell, One Punch Man is a mockery of other anime without being standoffish. Some Info:

One-Punch Man's first season aired in Japan between October 5, 2015 and December 21, 2015 All 12 episodes are currently streaming on Hulu Published and Licensed by VIZ Media Manga (currently ongoing) One Punch Man doesn't need big breasted girls, multi-episode / season-wide battles with a single enemy, giant robots or even suspense. It's a great anime without the annoying anime clichés and for that reason... was very refreshing to watch.

Saitama, unlike other anime protagonists, doesn't really give a damn. He's not trying to change the world or get some girl. He's not flashy and his hair never even changes colors... he's bald. He's indifferent and not particularly motivated. His origin story isn't particularly impressive. And his only conflict is being too damn strong... he defeats all of his foes in one punch.

When I caught wind of this anime about a hero that can defeat all of his foes in a single blow, I though ""well that must be boring"". Saitama's crisis is more existential, he's a man that can't be challenged One Punch Man may lack traditional suspense in battle, but One Punch Man is unique because the focus isn't really ever on the battle itself. Instead One Punch Man is made interesting with villains like Vaccine Man (an evil incarceration of all the world's pollution, of course), and their satirical plans to take over the Earth and/or make it a better place (like the dude in charge at The House of Evolution). One Punch Man is unpredictable on purpose. It's funny, and has an appropriately cliché cast of supporting heroes competing for rank in The Hero Association. Oh! and... Mumen Rider.

In a nutshell, One Punch Man is a mockery of other anime without being standoffish. While the plot of this anime may be satirical in nature, it is respectfully animated and has an awesome soundtrack in addition to a unique plot. I look forward to more! I also look forward to the New Anime from One-Punch Man's Creator, which will be releasing later this year.

"Good drama, but disassociated from it's orgin I like this show, sort of, except for its disassociation from its origin.

I wonder how many USA watchers of this show know it is based in a Canadian town? Maybe too many to make it popular. Americans automatically avoid Canadian TV. It is a Canadian TV show pretending to be American, but don't hold that against it. If you like it, that doesn't matter. But since the USA TV market overwhelmingly drives Canadian TV production ...

This is Canadian TV show, supposedly based on a real life Canadian town of ~ 4700 people. Yet, ""American"" (USA) references, concepts, and attitudes are prevalent, like: 
* Gibsons has its own police department. This might be usual in USA, but for Canada, smaller places like this in Canada do not. Only cities in Canada have their own police forces/departments. All other ""smaller"" places rely on the RCMP or provincial police forces.



* The show frequently mentions ""other states"", as if Gibsons is in a USA state, not a Canadian province.



* People in the show frequently use the term ""Pacific Northwest"" to refer to their location. That term is used by Americans, but not Canadians. To the USA, the ""Pacific Northwest"" is Washington State, to Canada, (if we used the term), the ""Pacific Northwest"" would be a much larger area, the coastline north of Vancouver Island, going up to Yukon and Alaska.


This is all due to the show wanting to appeal and sell to people in the USA. There are more people/customers in USA than Canada, so to H-E-double hockey sticks with Canadian identity/interests.",literal
"Another Jacqueline Susann novel turned into a movie... When they made this movie they tried to duplicate the success of ""Valley of The Dolls"" by including a fight scene, mod fashions, & a theme song sung by Dionne Warwick, but it flopped big time. Dyan Cannon is miscast as the bosses wife. Her character was supposed to be an ""older woman"". John Phillip Law is stiff & boring as the leading man. Jacqueline Susann (author of the book) wanted Charlton Heston, after she saw his backside in ""Planet of The Apes"", but he declined (good thing for him). Shecky Greene is very irritating as a fat, stand-up comic schlub. This is a watered-down version of the book, but not as entertaining as the movie version of ""Valley of The Dolls"". They just kept getting worse & worse, ""Once Is Not Enough"" (another Susann novel) was filmed after this & it's far less entertaining than ""The Love Machine"" (if you could imagine that).",figurative

"Pause & Watch Train Dreams on Netflix! At a time when we're simultaneously more connected and disconnected, I've been searching for authentic people and films like Train Dreams that ground me and allow me to pause and reflect. Shot almost entirely in natural light, this poetic film is an exploration of life, loss, nature, and the invisible thread that connects us all through both precious and painful moments. If you want to escape into a time where we were more present too, I invite you to watch Train Dreams! You'll be glad you did.

If you haven't seen it yet, make sure you add it to your watchlist too! 11/21 on Netflix.",literal
"Absolutely beautiful I've been quite excited for this film actually and I heard rumors it would be the Monday mystery movie so I knew I had to get my tickets. I think this film has such an interesting concept here and I think the movie really succeeds with me and I found myself to love this for the most part and I just think this movie really succeeds with such a great and romantic story throughout its runtime. I just think the acting here is phenomenal and our three main characters of Larry played by Miles Teller is truly fantastic and he gives us one of his strongest performances. Joan played by Elizabeth Olsen is also another really strong part of this film and Olsen delivers such a beautiful performance with some of the emotion she portrays in this. Callum Turner delivers another good performance playing Luke and I found these characters to be really strong and charming for me. The romance throughout this movie is really strong for me and I just feel for Joan as this situation is impossible to be in and you just have to feel bad for what's happening to her and the choice she has to make. This movie is also absolutely hilarious and there's some absolutely hilarious dialogue in this film as well and I was literally dying out loud in my theater watching this. This film is also just visually beautiful and David Freyne had such a beautiful vision with this film and he really captures these moments so beautifully. I just really love how this film portrays the questions of uncertainty, regret and more questions presented throughout the film. This movie also really drew at my emotions and I almost felt like crying because of how beautiful this film truly is with some of these ideas presented in it. The production design is also really incredible and I love the set designs in this film and the movie has some incredible scenery as well with this set. Overall I just think this movie is absolutely a gut wrenching and emotional film with hilarious genre blending of comedy as well with the romance and this is definitely worth watching in my opinion.",literal
"Exceeds my expectations Being a huge Addams fan (owning the books by Chas Addams, the tv series, the movies and, yes, even the cartoons) I've been looking forward to this new iteration since it was announced a year or two ago. I can tell you it doesn't disappoint and, in fact, delivers on all fronts. Following Christina Ricci's iconic performance is a tall order for anyone but Jenna Ortega knocks it out of the park with her portrayal of the titles title character. Her dead pan, sarcastic delivery is spot on but there's a sweetness to get poison tongue... You know, like ethylene glycol.

Rather than compete with the beautiful Angelica Houston, Catherine Zeta Jones brings her own interpretation to Morticia while Luis Guzman brings to life the Gomez Addams as he appeared in the original New Yorker Cartoons. This is a smart move because when it comes to the late, great Raul Julia.... Well, just don't. There's just no replacing him so sidestepping that issue was the best thing they could do.. Who is also here...Thing, that is. Along with Lurch, Pugsley and Uncle Fester.

There are also some surprises in the cast that I haven't mentioned.

Tim Burton has done a terrific job here of both updating and continuing the adventures of our favorite spooky family and I'm really looking forward to season 2.",figurative
"Wow. What a artistic experience! This movie was creative, artistic, spell bounding, captivating. The acting was spot on. Jacob Elordi deserves an Oscar for that performance. Never have I ever been so invested in characters journey. Victor was such an amazing character along with Elizabeth. They just kept you invested the whole time. Overall, it's a must watch. I need more Frankenstein!",figurative
"I was astonished I'm definitely smiling, this show is like the second coming of Christ for me and I've found myself laughing throughout the experience due to this shows perfect mix of heartwarming, violent or absurd moments along with the casts unpredictable nature always keeping me on my toes and leaving me flabbergasted.

If there's not a season 2 I'll definitely be smiling less!",literal
"Hope it wins LOTS of Oscars Wow, haven't seen a movie THAT good in years. Even though it's not a high action movie (like Mission Impossible), it was great to see it on the big screen since it was so engrossing. Best acting I've seen in years. Oscar should go to Russell and Ramy for sure. This is the movie Oppenheimer should have been.",literal
"The second high-quality series from Sheridan The second high-quality series from Sheridan, which has not yet had time to roll off.

Of course, the first season is much better than season 3, and even more so than season 2, which was written as if on an automaton, just to release it faster. 3 is a little better in this regard, and it seems to be a little more interesting to watch, especially at the end, but still somehow not as cool as the first one.

The first 10 episodes introduced everyone to the characters, and created a problem for several seasons, as well as outlined local conflicts that escalated into awesome 2 final episodes.

And then you just look at the machine.

Without such a titular star, you probably could have missed it, but Renner shows himself well as a star of a TV show. Everywhere everything will be sorted out and all problems will be solved. It's a real sight.

I want to believe that season 4 will be even better and the level of the first one will be reached. It was a perfect example of a high-quality crime series.",literal
"Started good and lost steam fast This show was pure gold at first when it was just penny and the boys: when Sheldon was never open to the possibility of a relationship because of his social awkwardness and inability to understand people, when Raj couldn't speak with a girl around, and a hot girl moves in. It was genius and hilarious. The introduction of Bernadette and Amy ruined this show. Their characters are awful and intensely annoying and unfunny. Their introduction also ruined other character's story lines. Sheldon never would've ended up dating a girl the way they wrote him in with Amy. Howard was perfect when he was the overly horny nerd, and him marrying and settling down with Bernadette ruined his character. They couldn't figure out how to keep Raj the silent character so they made him talk to girls and even date as well. Which was pathetic writing. Making Penny fit in with all of them ended up removing the hot, dumb blonde girl around nerds effect that made the show great to begin with. Now, Penny doesn't stand out as the hot girl against the nerds because they stopped writing her like that and just made it more like Friends instead of the clashing personalities dynamic that made this show good.",literal
"Suspend Reality and Enjoy the Ride Just set aside the implausible... everything in this movie and enjoy the campy thrill ride. Nothing in this universe is real, and it's not supposed to be. Just have fun with it.

The big one for me in all these movies is the massive crowd that gathers together to learn what really happened, but they're always just used as part of what the movie audience has seen. I'd never go see The Horsemen in real life for any reason other than to have money dropped from the ceiling or bitcoin deposited in my account. But then, who does that? LOL

So just enjoy it. Nobody is really dead. Nobody has really left the group. Nobody is really in jail. Or are they? LOL.",literal
So so so boring. Way too many emotions and side stories. Barely any police work... so boring. Too much family drama and talking but the dialogue isn't even good.... The only good actor was Dakota Fanning. Tried to watch with my parents but by episode 5 we were so sick of it that we just looked up the ending. Don't waste your time.,literal
"Please give us multiple seasons! This show is intoxicating. The script is funny, witty, and warm. The main characters have great chemistry and all the side characters all add their own appreciated flavor.

Kristen Bell is one of those actresses that makes the best choices for what she participates with and takes on, and this is no exception. This is a story that makes you want to be apart of their world. Adam Brody's character is like Seth but 20 years later- grown up, mature, and still charmingly funny.

I sincerely hope they renew the series and keep giving us more great content. One of my favorite light comedy shows of the year!",literal
"Producer Dick Wolf's shows are the best! My wife and I are hooked on this show. We have watched all of the episodes from the beginning and really look forward to seeing it every Wednesday night. The different story lines and plots are enough to keep you interested without being too dramatic. I have read many reviews that say it isn't realistic. It is Hollywood, folks - it can only be as close to real as TV allows. Get over it! I think that some of the rescue scenes are incredible. Hopefully some of the plots that were developing (like the dirty cop plot) are continued as they were great. Give this show a chance - it is like the 70's show Emergency! for 2012. If you like Law & Order then you will like this show too. It has the Dick Wolf touch that makes it a great show. We love it!",literal
"Well made, well directed, creepy horror movie after a long time. After having enjoyed his previous Barbarian, I was looking forward to this one.

One of the best part is the small-town setting which kinda reminds of Stephen King's works.

The director succeeded in narrating a story from multiple characters' points of view and it amplified the individual motivations, emotions and the different events aka the Rashomon-style multiple viewpoints.

Another best part was the trailer which didn't give away anything.

The movie has some of the best n very effective creepy scenes which made me scream wtf. Even Josh Brolin's character says wtf after a creepy encounter.

To enjoy this movie avoid extra trailers, avoid spoilers and go in as blind as possible.

There are moments of gore, heart pounding jump scares (not the lame ones, pg13 ones present in Conjuring n Insidious).

Juila Garner gave an atrocious performance. She looks anemic, pale n downright creepy.

Josh Brolin gave a solid restrained performance.",literal
"CLEVER & FUNNY SHOW - STOP COMPARING IT TO THE UK VERSION!!! The show - based on a UK sitcom of the same name - is very funny and cleverly done. Each of the actors plays their character well. Definitely a fun, light-hearted comedy that gives some good laughs.

Yes. The UK version is EXCELLENT. But that doesn't mean that the US version is a bad show. If I hadn't watched the UK version, I would have thought the US version was hysterical and unique. Generally, people do prefer the series they watch first. I loved the US version of The Office and then tried to watch the UK version, but couldn't get into it.

That said, the US version is different enough to make it enjoyable even for those of us who've seen the UK version. While a few of the ghosts are similar to the UK version, the US version has enough diversity in the characters and episode plots to make them interesting on their own.

And as for those comparing the living married couples: just stop. The US wife is optimistic and perky (the UK wife more sarcastic and snarky). The US husband is adorable and a little nerdy (the UK husband a bit of a clueless blue-collar guy). Again - stop comparing. Enjoy it for what it is.

Finally - DO watch the British version. It is really funny.",figurative
"A Movie with Soul I have thoroughly enjoyed the simplicity and the depth of this movie. Liam Neeson is Amazing ; Respect!. A movie that need to be watched by everyone. Excellent,. I will surely watch it with my son again down the road one day. Thank You.",literal
"One-man army at its best This is a very Finnish take on the nostalgic action movie genre. Good action movies with a one-man army are absolutely silly but when they are good - like Sisu and Sisu2, they are convincing in their own reality.

Action scenes in the Soviet Union are so over the top but make sense in the context of the story. Extreme but not psychologically serious violence of this film honors the genre of action films from the 80's and 90's. And many of us grew with those films which makes this feel nostalgic; you feel safe on your seats even though everything is covered with blood unless it is exploding into million pieces.

Jorma Tommila is just fantastic as the main lead: not a single word is said by him throughout the movie but his performance is one of the best I have ever seen. I guess that I just love actors who are extremely physical and raw in a subtle and precise way. There was this Finnish cult-leader like professor in the national theater school in the 1980's named Jouko Turkka. I think he would have been very proud of his student's job as an avtion star at the age 60+.

There is a dog and a man. No words. Just one man's mission to save what he can save when everything is lost. The ending is beautiful. Tommi Korpela has a small part but he makes every word count in the catharctic moment.

I enjoyded this film a lot. My American-Australian husband loved this as well (and the first one too).",literal
"Interesting.. I really wanted to love this series. However, I decided to look into why the Guiness family barely sounds Irish. Learning that the family was very associated with the English aristocracy and was against the Nationalist movement was disappointing. The show itself isn't too bad. But don't watch this with the expectation that it is a great ""Irish"" show. I could also do without some of the more modern sounding music. I will watch more of it as it does keep one's attention and is rather entertaining.",literal
"Enjoyable ... but who on earth thought that Selena Gomez could act? The show is cleverly done, with comedic brilliance from Steve Martin and a light enough touch for just about everyone. But Selena Gomez is unwatchable ... her intonation is flat as roadkill and her expressions are barely any better. She is so annoying to watch that my wife refuses to watch the last two episodes. It's quite a tribute to Martin, Short, and any others who were involved in the writing that the show is as popular as it is.",literal

"Never gets old, never will. I'm going to go straight to the point, and say this is the most hilarious show I've ever seen. Michael's idiocy, and Jim's pranks on Dwight,and even Stanley's grumpiness is even hilarious! The show not only makes you laugh, there are some heartwarming moments, and there are some moments where you didn't see coming. And you know another way how 'The Office' is an fantastic show? The show was still good when Michael left! An huge part of The Office left, and it still was great! I've seen the ending of the office, and both times cried (And proudly so), because during the show, you fall in love with the characters, you relate to them. Basically, what I'm trying to say is, it's worth the 21 minutes.",literal
"Brilliant Nobody Wants This, the 2024 rom-com series is a delightful contradiction It embraces familiar clichés while subverting expectations leaving you thinking long after the credits roll At its core Nobody Wants This is an exploration of life's everyday messes amplified by unfiltered honesty the premise is deceptively simple two unlikely individuals united by circumstance navigating a series of awkward encounters miscommunications and life-altering moments what makes it transcendent is its balance of slapstick humor and genuine emotion nlike most rom-coms this one doesn't let its characters escape the consequences of their choices they grow adapt and connect making their journey feel deeply human

The writing is sharp and witty, capturing not just how people talk but how they feel conversations are raw filled with both vulnerability and humor making them feel like exchanges you'd overhear in real life There are moments of verbal sparring reminiscent of classic rom-coms like When Harry Met Sally yet it remains grounded in the unpredictability of love

What stands out is how the show finds cinematic beauty in the mundane. From missed calls to clumsy first dates the directors weave chaos into heartfelt moments that reflect real-life relationships It's the tension between these chaotic yet intimate moments that keeps the viewer engaged The performances are stellar with the leads displaying palpable chemistry they embody their characters with an authenticity that makes their flaws endearing and their growth meaningful The supporting cast also delivers adding depth without detracting from the main storyline It strikes a perfect balance between realism and hope offering a conclusion that feels both earned and emotionally satisfying The series celebrates the messiness of love the inevitability of mistakes and the profound connections that emerge from it all It doesn't just entertain-it resonates by the end you'll find yourself laughing crying, and rooting for these characters as if they were real watch this one trust me you won't regret it.",figurative
"Love it. I have watched the pilot episode of Hazbin Hotel for the first time on YouTube since January 2020. I thought I never saw any adult cartoons like that before in my entire life. It's absolutely amazing. I just love it. It's probably one of the best adult cartoons of all time. Vaggie is my favourite character. I always have a crush on Vaggie.

I'm sure Hazbin Hotel might be perfect for some viewers who are sick of watching The Simpsons and South Park (especially the modern era) all the time.

I might watch the full series someday.

"One of the best premiers I have personally ever watched This show is great. It's amazing to see noah wyle back in action seeing as how he was part of the golden age of ER. His work make's it believable, the aspects that have been covered so far have been realistically depicted. This is an amazing setup and cast. It seems medically accurate so far as the first 2 are concerned, which also is another plus. This show so far has been everything I have ever wanted from an ER spiritual successor.

Each character has their own personality, and it shows. The way everyone kind of of gels but doesn't mimics how real life works as well. So as far as this series goes.

I'll give it a 10/10.",literal

"BETTER THAN THE FIRST The main difference between The Black Phone 2 and the first film is that while the original focused more on the thriller aspect, the sequel leans further into the horror genre. This shift is also reflected in the setting: the story now takes place in a Catholic camp for teenagers, deep in the woods - far from human settlements and difficult to reach during winter.

Another feature that enhances the film is the use of the Super-8 camera style in certain scenes (the type often used for nostalgic home videos). This visual choice heightens the tension during intense moments, increasing the viewer's heart rate and delivering a more immersive cinematic experience.

Although the story shares similarities with the first movie, this sequel carries a stronger sense of mystery, unfolding a series of interconnected cases that need to be solved.

If you've seen the first film, you should definitely watch this sequel.",literal
"Costner Is Strong As An Aging Cowboy Patriarch Kevin Costner is the patriarch presiding over a dynastic ranch that is the size of some countries. His way of life is being impinged on by resort developers, tribal rights, and the authority of the state of Montana. Reminiscent of Rock Hudson in ""Giant"", he is trying to hold on to the old ways.

""Yellowstone"" develops quickly with little introduction, yet its story unravels with the natural pace of a wilderness day, pausing for tribal rituals, cowboy conventionalities, and political machinations. It's a far flung undertaking that dwells on the seams between laws and justice, family and friendships.

Costner fills his character's boots naturally, it seems. He is a world-wearied man who has seen too much and lied too often. The land and the family are his lifeblood. He can hear the footsteps coming his way, but he can only fulfill his role-out of habit as much as loyalty.

Although some action is a little confusing due to lack of explanation, it feels natural, as if the viewer is getting a genuine slice-of-life glimpse into another world. I hope the resolution of this saga includes an emotional payoff that justifies its breadth and its attention to details.

Update 7/20/18: After four episodes, this series has a strong voice and a persistent rhythm. We learn the fullness of each story, from roots to fruits. I am increasing my grade to ""9"".",literal
"I rated it 9 before, but after 3rd season I had to downgrade it to 5 Season 1 was pretty good. Season 2 regular OK. But they ruined everything on 3rd season turning it into a childish sunday afternoon movie, full of cliches, sketchy BD-like villans and failed attempts to make comedy wich ended up destroying all the great misterious atmosphere of the 1st season. It's a shame.",literal
"I mean its allright but expected more Villains were rather lacking in my opinion, they were literally like puppets and the one villain that was flashed had a mid backstory that was also pretty boring, expected something more cruel, like yes it was sad but come on he is a demon for goodnes sake, second act was mid, a complete let down from the strong act 1, the 3rd act was.....allright. But from the whole movie i only liked two songs and i also expected more songs. The villains had mid songs, Your idol could have been better and its such a shame that we didnt get an actual cruel villain song. They could have played with the audience more. It just lacked some actual cruelty. The main main villain evil man was....essentially just a concept.....yeaaa nah ah why?

But it did have a creative magic system, funny moments and emotional beats as well with, of course, good animation.

It is a fine movie for a chill saturday night but it definitely needs stronger villains.",literal
"Amazing show I didn't read anything going into this show I just started the first episode so I could get a raw experience.

"Old school class This propulsive and intelligent film arrives at the multiplex like a burst of fresh air. Or rather, a burst of 90s air.

For me, the 90s as a decade was a time of intelligent yet accessible and crowd pleasing movies. A time where an adult orientated film could be made, filled with ""large"" performances and with something to say.

A time when Spielberg could make Schindler's List, Michael Mann could make The Insider, and Ron Howard was churning out dramas such as A Beautiful Mind.

Some good. Some forgettable, but aimed at adults and never trying to alienate its wide audience.

Compare that to the ""big"" films today such as One Battle After Another, Anora, or Bugonia, and the deliberate attempt to be niche and extreme, is really evident.

This film, far from perfect, had that classic vibe. Strangely enough so did Aronovsky's Caught Stealing a few months back, albeit in a very different film.

Nuremberg just felt refreshingly grown up.

Didn't really rate the performance of Malik as he seemed rather miscast, and the pacing was variable, but Michael Shannon was reminiscent of a Gregory Peck stoicism, and as for Russel Crowe, I felt he was fantastic.

Again, sad that back in the day, he'd have been talked up as an Oscar winner along the lines of Dr Lector, people would have been discussing his portrayal, whereas today, the film won't even make a ripple and will be on streaming within weeks whereupon it will disappear.

But I really do urge you to seek this film out on the big screen. It's worth the ticket price.",literal

"It was ok but I didn't like the lead character Gil Birmingham from Yellowstone was in one episode but I didn't know any other actor in this tv show in which a drifter survivalist for hire goes around from town to town taking on jobs finding people who have gone missing or have been kidnapped with the help of his team which includes a disabled hacker, a lawyer, a couple who find him jobs & a lady who does the same as him as he gets himself into all kinds of trouble trying to get the job done. I thought this was ok but it's been done before & kind of felt like a one man version of ""without a trace"" to be honest with some really good episodes whilst others made very little sense at all & I wasn't really a fan of the lead character who came across quite arrogant & money driven & I found myself wondering if a woman might have made a better & more compassionate lead character.",literal
"Simply and absurdly great ""Sisu"" is one of those films where you know exactly what to expect, delivering a blend of action and dark humor that keeps you engaged. While some moments may feel a bit exaggerated, the cinematography is outstanding, with striking visuals and immersive sound design that elevate the experience.

The film captures an ambiance reminiscent of a Quentin Tarantino movie, but with a unique twist featuring Nazis and an indomitable old man.

The intense action sequences and gripping storyline make it a thrilling ride from start to finish. Overall, ""Sisu"" earns a solid 8 stars for its captivating style and entertaining narrative.",literal
People are to hard on this One episode is not enough to draw off of. It kept me interested but wasn't standing out to me. I'll give it time to grow into its own. It is still early. Lets not take to much from just the pilot. Not completely House and not Elementary but it does have good spots. Be patient for the time being. Is it original? No but very few shows are these days. Everything spins off of something else. How many Law and Orders are there? Each the same but slightly different. I'm willing to watch to see if this can stand on its own. It has great potential as most new shows do. All crime/crime solving shows has some similarities.,literal
"Snook deserve her second Emmy absolutely Without a doubt the best series on streaming in recent years. Perfect casting of the entire team, with credible acting including Fanning, Lacy, and the Columbo-like detective Michael Pena. A series that leaves the viewer in the dark without any clues with plot twists until the last second of episode 8.

The score is fantastic so the locations, and the The photography.",literal
"Best show ever! I'm binge watching now, I'm at season 7 and I really believe is one of the best tv series ever! I watch many shows but this is so addictive. I don't know yet why Stabler is off the picture, I'm waiting to see what happens. No internet search spoilers, the show is so good, I don't want to spoil the fun.",literal
Great acting from all leads There seems to be a lot reviews downplaying the acting by Ms Gomez. She is playing a character to embody stereotypical Gen Z and I think she does a fantastic job (f-bombs and all)! Steve Martin and Martin Short bring classic comedy and writing while Selena Gomez helps provide a modern spin. I also appreciate Nathan Lane to throw in some Albert Goldman vibes. The writing is funny and sweet. My only complaint is I wish the episodes were a bit longer. I definitely recommend a watch!,literal
"Has the bones of something great As per the title of my review this could have been great but really falls short, there is a lot of superfluous dialogue that has nothing to do with any plot line and is never mentioned again and then some of the 'reveals' would have been better in earlier episodes as to explain some of the characters behaviour.

Great acting by Sarah Snook and Dakota Fanning but the rest of the cast not up to their standard.

This feels to me that it's yet another TV show where the writer/producer/creator doesn't trust the audience to understand plot lines and to be able to work things out for themselves, instead relying on spelling everything out resulting in a 'bulky' series.",literal
"almost excellent s1 that does the job S1 is very good-excellent. So far and currently, what s2 will bring, or supposed to, looks more than promising. Some room for improvements exists, that when used properly will make it all even better, while some shows just fall off, looks like Fallout will jump up..

So far the show is made a bit puzzley (don't know if puzzley is actual word), while importantly provides pieces of the puzzle, what shows that creators have the story already, and that's a good thing because will avoid never ending mystery that too many shows fall into, and also because leaves room for slight changes if necessary.

So far it seems that this can not fail (at least not in the near future), and hopefully will continue good..",literal
"Honest review Watched all episodes in a day that being said,really had higher expectations for this.

Unfortunately it was boring & simply dragged out,most exciting parts was in the very beginning/cliffhanger ending.

How the husband was a political figure & let alone her,is frankly beyond me.

Although there's plenty to complain over with the husband,will focus on her unrefined character.. From how she walks,talks,dresses & hygiene.

Will just say.. Felt he was undermining/shady/jealous of his wife,but she made things confusing on his role too.. She would get upset at his actions,but also when advice was needed & he restrained back.

Their marriage woes aside,which got annoying at points in the series.. Again,the storyline was boring yet unrealistic.

What irked me.. If a man abused his wife,would it be let go? There's a time & place for personal matters,but regardless abuse is never it. Absurd behavior & nobody stopped it,including security!

Don't get why her dirty mouthed behavior,was allowed such leeway even if she was (basically) new to it all.

She was being considered as VP? Yikes! Although refreshing than a typical stuffy suit,she seemed overly unpolished to even be a PTA president if she was a mom.. Also she acted like she was above all of it,didn't want it & made it hard believing in her.

She didn't like dressing up,fine! But how about fitted attire to flatter her & that was ironed plus more feminine looking shoes.. Also needed to stop carrying her purse/bag that way or have something nicer,the way she wore it looked like she was headed to a casual meeting. Granted females don't need to look always polished but in certain situations,you should conduct yourself a bit more accordingly.

If you want a series of people doing nothing significant,walking into rooms,going in cars,meetings,marriage issues.. You'll enjoy it! However want an intelligent series with drama,action,storyline of substance about a woman in power.. Forget it!

As mentioned above watched it all,because was hoping it improved as the series went on. It was cast decent and acting wasn't overly horrible,but maybe with better direction or script it could of been a more compelling series. The scenery and homes was beautiful,as was the cinematography.

Even if there's a continuation to this where a second season happens,unless certain aspects improve it will be a waste of time.

Is this worth watching? If you're bored or like the actors,otherwise skip it!

"Oh No I haven't seen a Christmas Rom Com Filmed In Canada that I didn't like in many years! A Merry Little Ex-Mas destroyed the good times. It's almost like it's a parody of a holiday rom com. I am not sure what it is but something about it I just really don't like. I am a fan of Alicia and think she does a great job but maybe it's the script or the editing. But something just doesn't quite take me there. So far I've laughed once, most of the time I am cringing because the comedy just isn't there. Sorry Melissa but...I just didn't like this like at all :(",literal
"Saul Goodman + Ehrmantraut > Walter White + Pinkman This show is special. I thought about a hundred times to discontinue it after the first few episodes of Season 1. They were slow, dark, felt meaningless at times and weren't able to grab my attention. However, I didn't quit. I kept it running while working from home. Little did I expect season 5 would end making Better Call Saul one of my most lovable and top 3 TV shows of all time. God, where did this all come from? Jimmy McGill, Michael, the lady, Los Pollos Hermanos, Nacho Varga, Salamanca were absolutely best. You cannot expect your cast to deliver any better they did in Better Call Saul. Vince, again, created an epic show, in fact better than Br Ba. Howard Hamlin, man that guy did a remarkable job, exceptional. Every character coming from Br Ba made sense. The plot is set so perfectly for Br Ba it can't get any better. Despite a slow season one although a good ending, the show picks up so well from Season 3 that there's no damn looking back. Jimmy McGill's character Arc was so wonderfully crafted however I'm sure there's more left in it. I loved the show would will to watch again, only it keeps a slow pace quite often although has more twists than Breaking Bad.",literal
"Really? This is What's Considered the Comeback for Adult Animation? I heard a lot of good things about this show: Funny jokes, good characters, good animation, and now I'm wondering if we watched the same show because this has none of that. I think the premise of the show is solid: A group of odd friends have to help people smile and each episode displays the hijinks to get to that point. But in execution . . . Meh.

Now, I haven't watched season 2 and don't plan to because season 1 gave me no reason to continue. I don't hate any of the characters in Smiling Friends (well except Mr. Frog and the boss gets on my nerves), but I didn't get attached or find any of them that memorable. Pim was alright. The voice acting was also fine, no stand outs good or bad.

As for the animation, I'm mixed. The good things are the main characters have good silhouettes and I like how many mediums they use (such as puppetry, claymation, live action, and rotoscope). For the negatives, the background characters for one thing. As I said before, a lot of the jokes rely on you finding the ugly art funny. There are multiple of these shrimp-esc characters that all look like recolors of each others and are animate the same. The human characters are also very unappealing and I can't tell whenever it's intentional or not. The backgrounds are fine.

The humor is the worst part of the show in my opinion. If you don't find screaming and loud noises funny, you won't like this show because that's nearly 50% of the jokes. The others 50% is made up of laughing at the grotesque art. I didn't laugh until episode 7. There are also multiple scenes of characters talking in that ""ha ha awkward"" way and I can't tell if those are jokes or not. They happen multiple times an episode and eventually all blend together, so the whole season is a blur. I would be much more forgiving if this was an indie web series, in that case it would be decent at best. But since it's critically acclaimed and produced by a major studio, I'm harsher.

Would not recommend this one. It wasn't offensive or overly awful, and good job trying something different, but different doesn't mean better.",literal
"Ignore the haters - I like it! As someone who enjoyed House, I actually enjoy this show! I really like the character mix, their individual stories, and the patient cases they covered. Instead of comparing it to other shows try appreciating what it brings. I'm 5 episodes in, and the focus on under-served people (black women in particular) is refreshing. This show hits some heavy topics - big pharma, false imprisonment all with the little spin of the Sherlock Holmes bit. Also, some of the wild ideas they come up with, combined with the character mix is fun. Also I'm still writing to meet the stupid character limit which I now met.",literal
"Super cringe but somehow entertaining ""Wednesday"" is honestly one of the most cringe TV shows I've ever watched. The dialogues feels awkward and the acting from Guzmán and Isaac was especially hard to sit through.

"This Movie is Genius This movie is one of the most Underrated movie of its time. When watching this movie , your filled with action, and when somethings not really happing , the humour is un matched.

"Sorry but this doesn't deserve all the 10/10s Granted it's good, and I like most of PTA's films, but it's not like this is anywhere near as brilliant as something like There Will Be Blood or The Master.

The plot is very simple, and while that's not a bad thing, I found it difficult finding anything substantial to grab onto. The performances are certainly good but again it feels like all the actors with the exception of probably Chase Infiniti and maybe Sean Penn aren't given a whole lot to do.

In my opinion this was far less interestingly photographed than something like Phantom Thread, and with less compelling characters than something like The Master, and lacked the spectacle and gravitas of something like There Will Be Blood.

Still better than most films releasing these days, but if you're looking at all the rave reviews like I was and expecting a masterpiece, from my perspective I'd be lowering my expectations.

It gets a 7/10 for being well performed and pretty well written, but I can't go beyond that because it lacked the depth I'd normally be seeking from filmmakers of PTA's caliber.",figurative
"From Masterpiece to mess - Ed Gein's story deserved better I absolutely devoured Dahmer, dark, haunting, and brilliantly executed. The Menendez season? Also great. So when they announced Ed Gein, I was hyped... and then totally let down.

The first episode had promise, creepy tone, great setup but it quickly fell apart. Random subplots everywhere, characters who show up once and vanish, and scenes that drag on forever. Ed Gein's real story is fascinating enough, they didn't need to twist it with hallucinations, filler, and fake drama.

What made Monster great was the grounded storytelling and focus on victims. This season forgot all that and instead focussing heavily on trying to make us sympathize with Gein. By the finale, it was a confusing, over-stylized mess - even borrowing from Mindhunter (and not in a good way).

Overall: Dahmer 9/10 Menendez 8/10 Ed Gein 2/10 Ryan Murphy's early work had real spark, but this one felt like creative autopilot. Here's hoping Season 4's Lizzie Borden gets the care and storytelling this one deserved.",figurative
Rookie Seriously one of the cutest and very enjoyable show to watch Nathan never disappoints. This show is enjoyable for most audience if you like cops and comedy some romance.,literal
"Brilliant , subtle, risky, and devastatingly human. This series is a straight standout. From the first episode, you feel the family as real people, not tabloid caricatures. The acting, writing, and direction show their humanity, love, loyalty, and flaws. That human touch deftly handles the series until the last couple of episodes when everything slips through the cracks. The pacing and flow let you live in their world, understand their choices and pressures, and give the story a depth that no documentary or media coverage has ever approached. The series navigates bias in a way that feels remarkably controlled. While Serial leaned toward Adnan and The Staircase often glamorized Michael Peterson, this series starts with subtle bias but incrementally drops it, unapologetically showing what actually happened.

There's also an ironic, sad truth about the iconic American Dream. We all strive to reach the 1 percent, yet we hate and tear down the 1 percent that we are striving for and, in many cases, selling our souls to become. This makes it an American nightmare. This series captures that tension perfectly, showing both the allure and the peril of power, wealth, and status without ever turning it into caricature.

The performances are incredible. The actor playing Alec, who I believe is Scottish, kills it, capturing his charm, manipulation, and selfishness. Patricia Arquette is brilliant, breaking away from her usual offbeat brilliance to play a grounded, straight character in a way I haven't seen before. The sons are excellent, showing the mix of influences from both parents, and the series captures these family dynamics with nuance and precision.

My biggest takeaway is that Alec is a foul, manipulative, and ruthless human being, but the rest of the family is not. True crime coverage has flattened this story into ""the Murdaughs are a corrupt 1 percent dynasty,"" but the series resists that. That is a risky production choice, going against what audiences expect and presenting a nuanced, humanized view of a family that people already want to vilify. That courage makes the storytelling even more compelling.

For me personally, what explains Alec's actions is not premeditation and not Snapped. In my opinion, these opioids completely fogged his brain and caused him to impulsively kill the mother and the son, then try to cover it up in a way that made total sense to someone under the influence of the true toxicity of opioids. A new American nightmare: the opioid crisis and its devastating effects on the brain over time. That perspective is what makes the story hit so hard for me.

Ultimately, this series is not about exploiting tabloid intrigue. It is about human complexity, a family with real depth, and a single man whose choices destroy everything he touches. The subtlety, nuance, human feel, and willingness to go against expected narratives make it unlike anything else I have seen in true crime.",figurative
"Doesn't deserve to have an overall higher rating than Freaky Friday (2003) It's terrific that Lindsay Lohan finally is back on the big screen and reuniting her and Jamie Lee Curtis is enjoyable to watch because of their warm, fun chemistry. I chuckled a little at a couple scenes and a few lines of dialogue here and there. Main highlight was Lohan singing and performing ""Take Me Away"" with the fictional band Pink Slip in the film. Although, the watered down forced humor jokes that are too politically correct, cringe and unnecessary Gen Z/Gen Alpha TikTok humor and dialogue, and the four-way body swap does hurt this film from being better than being known just as a by-the-numbers nostalgia bait sequel. Two groups of adults in my theater were constantly laughing at dialogue that wasn't even funny lol. This sequel is much much less naturally funny than its predecessor 2003 film, but again that's no surprise, it's poor writing. Worth a watch yet doesn't have rewatchable quality for a many years later overdue albeit not needed sequel, again not a surprise.",literal
"I really do like this show My biggest issue however is the pacing. We go from a week after the pilot, to like a month, to FIVE MONTHS. The characters are severely underdeveloped, and there's a lot of telling rather than showing. We barely know any of the main characters back stories! Why are they there? Why do they want redemption? Why should we care about them? We get to know more about some of the background characters than the main ones! The show says the guest are getting better, but we barely get to see any of that happening. The show says two characters have a father daughter relationship, but we never get to see that form. Everything just needs to slow down! They had plenty of time to have the characters interact and form connections that feel natural, but noooo! They wanted to get straight to the big boss fight!",literal
"like it a lot The first viewing was quite a bit to take in, and I came away with more questions than answers. So I watched a second time, rewinding occasionally to pick up hushed or muttered conversation, and just to sort out who's who among the characters. There is a lot going on in the plot, at least 4 maybe 5 forces are pitted against another. The only protagonist seems to be the estranged son Kayce, nearly everyone else has an antagonistic agenda toward someone or thing. This second look really helped put it all together. I'm looking forward to the season.",literal
"Superman: Legacy of Disappointment If boredom had a cape and could fly, it would be this movie. Superman: Legacy manages to do the impossible: make the Man of Steel feel like a soggy paper towel.

Let's start with the plot-if we can even call it that. It's less of a storyline and more of a loosely taped collage of clichés, half-baked ideas, and scenes clearly written during a lunch break. We're introduced to a Superman who has all the charisma of a DMV employee and the emotional range of a brick.

The villain? An AI-generated placeholder with all the menace of a wet sock. The stakes? About as high as deciding between decaf or regular. And don't even get me started on the forced ""emotional"" moments, which had all the subtlety of a freight train and none of the impact.

The dialogue is painfully robotic, as if the characters are reading fortune cookies to each other while pretending it's Shakespeare. Clark Kent spends half the movie brooding like a sad influencer who lost his Wi-Fi, and the other half giving awkward pep talks that somehow manage to be both boring and unintentionally hilarious.

Visually, the CGI would've looked impressive back in 2006. But in 2025? Watching Superman fly looked more like someone struggling with a green screen TikTok filter.

And finally, the pacing: glacial. Entire civilizations have risen and fallen in the time it takes this movie to move from one dull scene to the next.

In summary, Superman: Legacy is less a cinematic experience and more a two-hour exercise in wondering what went wrong. If you're a fan of Superman, avoid this one to preserve your sanity-and your childhood.",literal
"Well done series ""Peaky Blinders"" comparisons are tiresome and should be shelved. Do you really want the same creators to be one-track ponies? This tells a very fictional family story which touches on enough history of its era to keep things believable and engaging.

Fantastic production values in every respect, including setting and costuming. Great performances from key cast, too.",literal
"Sirk and Metty's best Sirk couldn't even get through the book and just worked from the previous screenplay. The story is ludicrous but the film is gorgeous. The segment just before Hudson returns maybe one of the most visually stunning ever put on film. Sirk's use of music is outstanding. Even the mise en scene is highly stylized. Hudson looks gorgeous but over plays it sometimes as does Rush. They both do much more right than wrong. Wyman is brilliant. In the midst of this true melodrama is this very minimalist performance. It's a very similar to the one she gives in ""Heaven"" but here there is the contrast with the films overwrought narrative. The narrative is pure cheese but the filmmaking is as compelling today as it would have been in 54. Beyond having Hudson function as the ingenue in some respects there isn't any strong social commentary so it isn't as embraced as ""Heaven"" or ""Imitation"" but it is just as beautiful and visually inventive as those films. If you like melodramas, women's films or bravura filmmaking see it.",literal
"Merrry Christmas from Chevy Chase! I don't know how anyone could ever go in life without seeing Christmas Vacation, it's one of the necessary movies you have to watch during the holidays. The reason being is that everyone can relate to this movie in one way or another. Who hasn't had their crazy family over during the holiday season? Well, that's Christmas Vacation, one of the funniest movies you will ever see. You think that Vacation topped it off with the laughs, believe me when I say that you've seen nothing yet. With an all star cast that clicked so well, you couldn't go wrong going on a great Christmas Vacation with the Griswolds.

Clark Griswold has really got the Christmas spirit this year, and his wife Ellen, son Rusty, and daughter Audrey have noticed that. Clark has invited Ellen's parents Art and Francis Smith, his own parents Clark and Nora Griswold, and his Aunt Bethany and Uncle Lewis to spend the holidays at the Griswold house in Chicago. But in spite of all the good intentions and careful planning, Christmas plans start to go awry: crazy squirrels, SWAT teams, burning Christmas trees, an over cooked turkey and of course a visit from the world's favorite white trash with a heart of gold Cousin Eddie! A Christmas ride not to be missed with the Griswold family.

One of the things I just adore about this movie is the little touches they put in the film: the grandparents falling asleep to an old Christmas movie playing on TV, the anxiety you feel as the doorbell rings knowing who's going to be behind it, and the little awkwardness during dinner when you hear everyone chewing their food. Chevy Chase is still such a pervert of course going for the hot sales lady instead of Cristy Brinkley this time, but you can't help but love and laugh at his fantasy in the back yard while the whole family is swimming in his most wanted work bonus: a family sized pool. He maybe a crazy pervert at times, but you feel the love he has for his family and how badly he wants Christmas to be perfect.

There are some great laughs in this movie: a squirrel gets caught in the Christmas tree that Clark brings in and it attacks the family and neighbors! Clark gets upset that there is no Christmas bonus so his cousin Eddie kidnaps Clark's boss, wraps him in a bow and gives him to Clark so he could kick him in the butt! A cat chews on the Christmas lights and gets electrocuted under the chair. But if you also get past all the slap stick humor, you still feel the Christmas message at the end, that despite all the craziness that comes around Christmas, don't forget what it's really about: peace and love. A wonderful ending and a perfect movie for Christmas that I watch every year, Christmas Vacation is definitely in Santa's movie collection somewhere.

"A Reminder Why Jackie Chan Is a Legend Watching The Shadow's Edge (2025) was both nostalgic and thrilling. Seeing Jackie Chan-my childhood superhero-still in action ignites a mix of admiration and emotion. Though time has passed, the fire in him hasn't faded. Jackie shows once again that he remains unmatched when it comes to blending raw action with heartfelt storytelling.

The movie itself is an absolute ride: packed with intense sequences, compelling drama, and that classic Jackie Chan blend of emotional depth and physical brilliance. Yes, the police approach in catching the mastermind is a little unrealistic at times, but come on-this is cinema, and it does exactly what it's meant to do: entertain with style and energy. We've accepted far crazier things in franchises like Mission Impossible, so no complaints at all.

The storyline is engaging and layered, with real emotional stakes that Jackie anchors brilliantly. His presence is magnetic-as always-and every action scene is a reminder of why he's a legend. If you're a fan of Jackie Chan, action films, or just good cinema, this movie delivers on every front. It's a thrilling, heartfelt, and satisfying experience from start to finish. Jackie Chan continues to fascinate me. Wow...just wow.",literal
"Intense fantasy/musical epic full of emotions This is really worth your time. An epic musical version of the story of the fantasy theme oz which combines both the fantasy and musical genre in to an epic result.

Music in this film occupy most of the film like two thirds of the whole film if i'm not mistaken and although not all the songs were great as there were some average or forgettable songs still there were quite a few excellent themes which brought a smile to the faces.

One of the few negatives was the film was too long and it more seemed like an extended dvd edition rather than a theatrical version but still it was so enjoyable that u could not really tell how time passed.

One of the strongest positives was the film was full of intense emotions and full of energy everywhere.

The three main characters were presented in a great way and the white witch was adorable too and i always love jeff goldbum.

If u really like a good fantasy musical film then this is for you.

The film is not perfect by far but it's a very solid effort which keeps u in your seat until the end.

A part 2 is confirmed for a future release so to conclude the story of the evil witch so stay tuned.

Get the dvd and the cd soundtrack in to your collection.",literal
"Am I an accomplice now....? 7.0/10 (Recommend)

I have been looking forward to this one since I've seen the trailer, and honestly I was not disappointed. While the pacing is a little slow, and in the second half things seem to drag slightly, it's still an enjoyable story. Despite the slightly slow pacing it doesn't feel like you're watching a movie. The way scenes are captured it feels like you're part of the action, or at the very least a fly on the wall.

Channing Tatum is a lot of fun in the role of Jeffery Manchester, and the chemistry him and Kirsten Dunst have is satisfying. Sure he's a criminal and she's just an oblivious single mother, but they feel natural together and you can't help but cheer for a positive outcome.

The film isn't overly funny, but it has some funny bits where you can at least chuckle. The vibe is that this is a slightly more serious, ""emotional"" film than it is a comedy. And it may look like a family movie, but be mindful that there are a few n-words thrown around, a sex scene or two, and a brief nip slip. Oh no, not a nip slip, you say. Well, some may be concerned with the content they take in or what their kids or teens watch so I mention it.

Overall, this is definitely a film to see in theatres even. The true story and the Hollywood story may be overdramatized, but this story will definitely entertain. While the pacing is a little slow, the story pulls you in and makes you feel like you're part of the adventure. Channing is fun, Kirsten is loveable, and you just want to see the bad guy succeed because he lures you in perfectly.

That's it for now. Thanks for taking time to read my review. Happy watching and enjoy the show!",literal
"Spoiler, sure, but is it though? This movie checks all the Christmas/holiday movie requirements: mixed-race supporting couple, LGBTQ+ couple, someone working in real estate or real estate-adjacent career, small town with a Christmassy name, environmentally conscious character/subplot ... to name a few -- in addition to the ""will they or won't they"" narrative that always ends in ""they will."" I guess that's a spoiler, but is it really? I watch these movies and think, they must pay well. Otherwise, why would good actors like Silverstone and Hudson do them, not to mention Jamil (was thrilled to see her)? And they're probably quick and easy to shoot. Plus, I always get the vibe that the cast and crew have fun shooting them. Still. Can't we set higher standards? I agree that the main characters lacked chemistry and the plot was predictable. Movie makers: You've got a formula for these holiday movies. Find one aspect of the formula and twist it for us, just to make it work the 90 minutes, yeah?",literal
"A real movie after a long time! Coming in a time when there's an overkill of superhero and fantasy flicks, when all we find except, are mediocre rom-coms and unremarkable horror films, is an old fashioned cat and mouse thriller with comedy at the right places, all in a newly imagined never seen before setting of a rebellious group on the run.

At the heart, is a beautiful dad and daughter relationship which is an absolute revelation in the movie.

"Politically Correct, Predictable, and Painfully Generic The best that can be said about Tracker is that it ticks every box on the politically correct checklist. We've got a white ""superhero"" protagonist, his handlers-a stereotypical middle-aged lesbian couple with one resembling an Ellen DeGeneres lookalike-an Asian lawyer secretly crushing on him despite her overly bossy demeanor, and a black computer nerd who magically conjures plot-advancing information out of thin air.

Beyond this carefully curated ensemble, there's little to hold onto. The show is predictable to a fault-you'll know exactly how it ends within the first five minutes of each episode. The lone-wolf, woods-educated protagonist is neither believable nor compelling, and the lines he's given feel more suited to a Hallmark movie than a gritty action drama.

Tracker lacks originality, depth, and emotional engagement. The characters are flat, the plotlines are cookie-cutter, and the attempts at tension or excitement fall utterly flat. If you're looking for a series to challenge you or keep you on the edge of your seat, keep tracking past this one.",literal

"Don't be spoiled, the series is pretty good. For these three episodes, quite a good series, it holds the attention nicely. Music, framing very nicely done. The atmosphere, snowy cold, additionally gives a mysterious flavor to this series. The flaws that I noticed for these 3 episodes are that some dialogues and actions are somehow unnecessarily complicated and confusing, who is working with whom, why, how and the like, but ok, I hope that in the further development of the series everything will be arranged nicely. I have to note that the casting for the roles is terrible. Both for the main villain and for the female agent. Especially for him, it had to be much better, although the main villain, his appearance is unconvincing. I look forward to the new episodes.",literal
"Goated! Absolutely awsome movie, great story, great characters, great everything! David is an amazing superman, the suit is so coooooooool, and he is not to op, the movie literally starts with superman getting defeated, anyone can watch this movie 💯 recommend it for anyone, especially superhero fans!!!!!!!!",literal
"It is all about a Karen ... What a shame. This could have been a great show. Instead, a white blond Karen is making it look bad.

I don't understand the rating. Must have been influenced by the creator.

The bad acting of Carol ( a pure Karen ) made me lose interest in that promising tv show.

Let's hope she will get calmer over time.",literal
"Lilyhammer from Netflix, now with Sly 😞 Seen the 5 first episodes, and great story so far.

But the plot: ex, Italian gangster, out of prison, and moves to another ""country"" , and in his own, old way, makes a business as ....a gangster.

Impressing, how fast you can get a gangster business running, and even more, how fast he learns how to operate a smartphone and a PC, after spending 25 years in prison 😉

Stallone does a great figure, and the acting is so far on track.

Write-off, from the great serie on Netflix, Lilyhammer. Just without the snow

Looooved that, but the humour runs also in Tulsa King, so I will keep watching. Give them Hell, Sly.",figurative
"Could've been worse Kinda cute, but startlingly derivative. I was expecting Albert Brooks to make a cameo. The lead cast is attractive, except for the dude who looks like a young Lyle Lovett: he was an incredibly stiff and unrealistic actor, I can only imagine him getting this role because he's a Nepo baby.

Rare mistake by A24.",literal
"Imagine an Ice Cream Shop So imagine you go into an ice cream shop and you order a sundae. They've got all kinds of nice stuff going on, beautiful delicious soft serve vanilla bean ice cream, some hot fudge, freshly cracked up peanuts, woah what is that?? A brownie? Some delicious house made whipped cream... Man this sundae is gonna be spectacular. Wow what more could you ask for? Cherry on top? Bring it on!!

And then all of a sudden they put an anchovy on top, and then another, and then a couple more, and then squirt some Dijon mustard on for good measure.

You don't even want the sundae anymore, in fact, you can't even look back on how nice that sundae used to be without thinking about all the stupid s*** they did at the very end just when it was going so well.

That's essentially Game of Thrones. I tried to rewatch it, but as I got through the first season I began looking at where all the pieces land at the end it's literally impossible to go back to. There are just so many ruined character arcs, so much pointlessness, and every time I come back here I drop it one more star it seems like. Game of Thrones is a beautiful anchovy sundae.",literal
"Laugh out loud comedy If you have been a patient and/ or especially if you are/ were a nurse (or had family or friends that are/were) I am sure you will love this. 12 episodes in and I have laughed out loud during every episode. Perfect cast, acting, writing, directing, producing. Hoping there is a season 2.

Love seeing some of the fantastic cast from Superstore in the show.

Love the characters. Love the scenarios. Love everything about this. I could easily have watched more episodes having watched 12 back to back but sleep beacons. I will be smiling and laughing at some of the one liners, scenarios, non verbal responses etc. For days to come.",literal
"Problematic but enjoyable This review is based only on the first episode. High Potential is enjoyable if you don't take it too seriously. In the real world, none of this would happen. The female lead would be in jail and not getting job offers.

I enjoy a strong female lead, but it feels like they were trying too hard with the ""women rule the world and are so much smarter than men"" angle. As a woman, this feels more degrading than empowering. It would have been more impactful if intelligence had been more balanced, as it is in the real world. But I'm hopeful with more character development, that may balance out.

If you're a true crime lover, this show probably isn't for you. You'll get hung up on the problematic details and the breaks in protocol that would ruin any chance of getting a guilty trial verdict. But, if you like lighthearted crime shows that are a mix of NCIS and off-brand Sherlock/Monk, this show may be for you.",literal
"Hard to watch sober I like Jason Clarke and Apple TV has been on a bit of a role, so I thought this would be worth watching. But it's super corny and the writing is incredibly lazy. There's little character consistency and constant contradictions. I'll probably finish season 1, but only because it's kinda fun ripping on how dumb most the characters are.",literal
"Why do so many great actors generate such an weak show? I love Kirsten Wiig, Alison Janney, Laura Dern, actually all the actors featured in Royal Palm. So why did it end up such an annoying show? I really tried and watched a few eps. However it actually got worsens worse as one couldn't identify or sympathize with any of the main characters. The show can't decide whether it's a parody, or farce or comedy or everything together? If the story is so boring, why even produce something Royal Palm, Apple? I am sorry to say but more and more Apple Original shows are forgettable and badly done. And O don't get why a person with Kirsten Wiigs talent can't find the right vehicle.",literal
Bout time Zach had his own series He's been in several series I've watched over the years as a costar. Always had a good presence. He does usually play a variation of the same character but he plays it well. Series is of to an intriguing start. I remember seeing a movie several years ago with the same characters ( not the actors ) and it was good. With a show featuring Native Americans as the main characters it should offer something a little different. Not crazy about the timeline and what purpose it serves but I'll go with it. Wasn't boring or slow but it could use a little more pulse. Nevertheless I'll be here for the series run. Should be good.,literal
"Top Notch I'm watching often tv shows while working and this one has probably run the most often next to big bang theory (I mean several times all seasons^^)... It's funny, interesting, smart (often :'D), creative, action packed, exciting, overloaded with feelings and has the perfect crew for what it is. So many unique characters that all grow in their own way, a lot of unexpected stuff thats happening and it's fantasy which i love most from all genres. How certain heavenly and hellishy individuals act together is sometimes just hilarious^^ Very well written and executed! I have certainly not watched it for the last time ;)",literal
"Billy Bob Thornton & Jon Hamm give great performances Landman is another hit in a long line of them for Taylor Sheridan. This has everything you want in a good series, it has plenty of drama, action, twists, even a little comedy, etc. It's obviously beautifully written because everything Sheridan does is but it also has an amazing cast. It stars the incredible Billy Bob Thornton, Jon Hamm, Ali Larter, Demi Moore, among others. Billy Bob Thornton was born to plays this role, he is absolutely terrific here. I'll be shocked if he doesn't get nominated for an Emmy for his performance here. Same goes for Hamm. Besides being beautifully written and acted, it's also beautifully shot too. Sheridan has so many great shows to his name and Landman is among the best of them. This look like it's going to have a long run and I'm here for it.",literal
"This isn't Frankenstein Weird science has got to be the most illogical picture John Huges ever scripted, but I can't say is that it doesn't have appeal.

Two teenage boys Wyatt and Gary take inspiration from Frankenstein to create the perfect woman who will bend to their every will. 

What they didn't expect is for Lisa to have a mind of her own and a few powers thrown in for effect.

I never heard of a computer hologram that can become a living breathing person not does it go into what Lisa really is. A genie? A mystical goddess from another time and place?

What makes this movie work is that the comedy aspect work very well rather the boys are finding frozen grandparents in the closet, Lisa mentioning private moments in the bathroom to parents or when a house party erupts into an outrages smorgasbord carnival funhouse.

In the end, Gary and Chet really do overcome insecurities to become brave young men who don't need a model to make them into cool guys. It was already inside them screaming to come out.

Weird Science is full of heart and witty humor that will have you coming back to revisit again and again.",literal
"I just saw Sisu in the cinema - it's brilliant. SISU I just saw Sisu in the cinema - it's brilliant.

Without a doubt, the best film I have seen in the cinema this year, and that includes all the boring BAFTA-winning rubbish I had to endure.

It's a brilliantly entertaining action war film with minimal but essential dialogue. Brilliant performances, fantastic direction, awesome Cinematography and some of the best blocking I have seen in years.

There are 4 shots that will stay with me until my brain is destroyed for medical research.

This is a proper cinematic film that begs to be seen in the cinema and just goes to remind you that directing is an ART, and very few people are actually any good at it.

You do not need famous actors to tell a great story and you do not need a famous Cinematographer to make things look good.

This should win all the awards everywhere for everything. I don't care what anyone else thinks - this was a brilliant afternoon's viewing.",literal
"When do we find out they never found Holmes body? Lazy knock off of House... The Ducklings in this one talk too much. I now realize in House one of the good things about House not talking to patients was it gave Ducklings more to do.

How many of us knew that the girls were sisters before the team came to that conclusion?

In House, it would have come about by each of the Ducklings added a clue, unknown to us, then House would have added one more clue and clinched it.

They told us so much in the opening episode about everyone.

Hell, we even saw him shirtless already. Much of this info could have come out in future episodes.

When do we find out Holmes body wasn't found?

If that cheap teaser happens, my rating drops 1 star.",literal
"Hatosy gives Barkin an acting lesson. As an Australian based in Melbourne I'm familiar with the story of crime family who inspired the film the series is based on. I love the film and originally thought the show didn't do it justice. My daughter loves it though so I watched it with her. By the end of S01 / start S02 I was hooked. The acting, writing, direction and production values are generally on par with most high profile cable shows with 2 exceptions: 1 - Shawn Hatosy just smashes it as ""Pope"". His portrayal as a disturbed anti-social with significant prison time under his belt proves him to be one of the most underrated Character Actors working today. 2 - Ellen Barkins portrayal as ""Smurf"", the Cody crime families matriarch is quite possibly the worst acting by a name actor in a long time role on television that I have ever seen. I'm not going to list the ways she manages to destroy what could be the shows best character - there's plenty of examples smattered throughout other reviews here. It's enough to say her acting has deteriorated to the point that by season 4 it makes the show difficult to watch.",literal
"The Art of Letting Go A beautifully written and performed film about family, regret, and reconciliation. Trier's direction is tender yet precise, blending humor and melancholy. Stellan Skarsgård gives a quietly devastating performance, while Renate Reinsve radiates restrained emotion. The ending twist - film within a film - is brilliant. Thoughtful, elegant, and deeply human.",literal
"At what point do we say we have had enough Grey's Anatomy? Don't get me wrong. I still watch grey's anatomy till this day, but one thing I can't get over is how much this show has changed since Shonda Rhimes left as show runner and Krista Vernoff took the reins. Some of the story lines are simply repetitive. In my opinion Jackson Avery has no story left telling after April was written off the show. Owen is one of the worst characters to ever exist. I truly hate his hypocritical views. Arizona and April leaving was a HUGE mistake in my opinion. They both had interesting stories worth telling. The way Alex Karev went back to his toxic ex wife as a way to explain Justin Chambers leaving the show was insane. Was there no other way of ending his story in a better situation??? Meredith is like a cat. She's like on her 6th life. Can't tell if she's actually going to make it out of this COVID19 story line. Joe is just a good character that no longer has a meaning after Alex was written off the show. Miranda is there because she has to. She's the chief. Great. Dr. Webber aswell, he's just around. There is not much a personal story to follow from his perspective. Jackson's mom is around because she owns the hospital. Idk. I just think it's time for this show that has given us so much good tv to come to an end. And I give it a 8 because even though I don't like some aspects about this show it still enjoy watching it!!",literal
"Alright movie K-Pop Demon Hunters was alright, but nothing special. The music and visuals were pretty cool, which kept me watching. The story felt kind of basic and didn't really grab me. Characters were okay but didn't leave much of an impression. If you want something fun and light, it works, but don't expect too much. Overall, a 6/10 from me.

Its okay movie not good or bad just alright.",literal
"Return of Claire's quivering lower lip It appears almost immediately in under a minute, yet I was able to get through the entire series with lots of fast forwarding.

Overall the story is just not that good, despite the two leads driving it. 8 episodes is quite a bit for a simple story with a few twists, not that complicated and easily predictable from the outset.

The reveals aren't interesting either, and it's not nearly as good as Homeland or The Americans, which I both loved.

I don't think there's a fix for this. You can't trim it and make it better, although that would help. The writer can't add any more plot twists as there just isn't enough meat in the story to do so.

So it's a 4/10, barely watchable, lots of boring exposition and flashbacks. Perhaps it's a Dateline 90 min story stretched to 8x50mins. Ignore the plot holes and everyone is a supercop/super villian and you'll get through it without thinking. And quickly forget this series.",literal
"I couldn't be MORE changed For Good! Wicked: For Good defies gravity and exceeds expectations set by Part One. The character arcs are expanded and deepened, the cinematography and directing builds a ""calm before the storm"" energy that will leave you glued to the screen, and the set design and costuming/makeup truly brings the whole story together for good!

Performances by the entire cast left me with goosebumps, especially those of Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo. The Oscar campaign for these actresses is going to be wild and BOTH deserve to walk away with their WELL-EARNED awards in their respective categories. The buildup of their stories coincide in a beautiful and painful way that left me turning away with tears that refused to stop.

And I, of course, HAVE to mention the INSANE tension between Marissa Bode's and Ethan Slater's on-screen chemistry. The deep layers of Nessarose and Boq were visible in ways unexplainable by words, but more so through the feeling I had running up my spine.

When it comes to the vocal performances of the soundtrack, Thank Goodness and NO GOOD DEED truly stood out to me. Cynthia is an absolute powerhouse and had the entire audience erupting in cheers and applause.

When it came to the second half of the film, it was definitely faster paced while still allowing key moments to have their centerstage spotlight. And of course, we have the crossover with The Wizard of Oz that fortunately does not steal away from the core of the film. Jon M. Chu, you are a GENIUS. I truly enjoyed how many off-stage moments were expanded in this film and allowed for many narratives to be dived deeper into.

And then there's For Good...holy shiz. I was crying for half the song and then immediately after all the way until the end of the film. There's also ONE scene that was not rushed and gutted my heart out in ways I can't even explain.

All in all, it's an astounding conclusion to a beloved franchise. I am truly changed for good.

Congratulotions!",literal
"The Gilmore Girls - A Life Without Consequences Warning: spoilers follow. Please only read if watched all seasons and only looking for another perspective on the show.

The Gilmore Girls is a good old fashioned family drama centred around the different generations of the Gilmore family. The Mother Daughter relationship forms the emotional core and how they interact with family members and the local community around them. The supporting characters, like Kirk, will grow on you as the series develops whilst others, like Michel, you will find irritating for the entire seven series.

Compared to much of the other dross you find on TV there is a lot of quality in this show with solid acting, funny and sad moments and good storylines. Sadly if you binge watch via Netflix, you will find yourself start to feel more and more irritated by the lead characters as the series unfolds.

The greatest source of irritation is the obsessive way the series creators/driving force The Palladinos protect the main characters Lorelai and Rory from any consequences for their actions.

The examples of this are many; both are able to eat copious amounts of junk food with no impact to their stick like figures. The Palladinos are essentially saying that if you are attractive, intelligent and sassy that you are immune from obesity. It is inverted snobbery of the highest order. Interestingly Sookie the non-threatening simple larger friend is never filmed eating loads but clearly in Palladinos eyes doesn't possess the intellectual capacity to be spared weight gain.

Other examples: Lorelai leaves fiance Max just before the wedding and goes on a road trip instead. Once back, she is spared the expected showdown with Max and instead moves to the next guy. Its only about Lorelai with no consequences for her selfishness. She then ultimately bounces between Luke and Chris, dropping one for the other depending on who meets her demands best.

Rory is no different; she breaks up an ex-boyfriend's marriage and then is rewarded with a new millionaire Yale boyfriend. She leaves her mother's home with no warning and is rewarded with a place at her millionaire grandparents place. She leaves the grandparents with no warning and is rewarded with an emotional homecoming to mother with no requirement for a clear the air discussion most of us would have. The one concession to consequences which is a clear the air dinner at the grandparents which provides the type of depth and accountability which the series often lacks.

All the way through the show we are continually told what a golden child Rory is because of her supposed intelligence. Her every whim is indulged by Stars Hollow. However, her friend Lane has twice the amount of emotional intelligence and overcomes a stifled childhood and a strict mother but this is never appreciated by the town in the same way.

At the centre of the family dynamic are the grand parents Richard and Emily who are both brilliantly written and the characters casting is perfect. The Friday night family dinners provide the best dialogue moments of the whole series as rifts are exposed and worked through. The interplay between the four leads is impeccably written and performed.

Another interesting aspect is that whilst Lorelai mocks her parents and their lifestyle, when it comes to being part of their dinners, parties and get togethers, she fits in effortlessly; she dresses the part, acts the part and generally feels completely at ease. Lorelai may have escaped a life of privilege but she is essentially still a product of that privileged world.

Talking of the grandparents, how Kelly Bishop who plays Emily did not win an Emmy over the seven series is a total mystery. She steals every scene and her portrayal of a life of privilege is an acting masterclass in itself.

The reunion series A Year in The Life clearly was conceived with good intentions but very badly executed. The four extended epsoodes contain weak storylines, scenes that drag on forever and have awful self-indulgent moments like the Stars Hollow musical. Old cast members return but with storylines of no substance. They almost look embarrassed to be returning to their old characters looking so much older. Rory's behaviour throughout the follow up is dreadful on both job and relationship fronts but of course the Palladinos ensure there are no consequences for her as ever. The one storyline of any depth is the therapy sessions between Lorelai and Emily which are abruptly halted and never followed up. The final moment is ill conceived and turns the series into soap opera cliffhanger mode.

Overall, the Gilmore Girls is well worth watching and maybe if I had watched one episode per week over seven years then the series irritations would not have been so noticeable. In short, I blame Netflix !",literal
"Fantastic!!! I must say it's such a pleasure to watch St. Denis Medical - much more of an authentic TV drama than most of the medical shows. This series manages to show the busy, emotional and the funny aspect of the healthcare system.

Probably its strongest feature is its realism in the depiction of the everyday struggles of doctors and other medical staff. The people are real, the problems are real, and the comedy is just the right kind of comedy most people know how to deal with stress in tough situations.

It depicts the dedication, teamwork and struggles of healthcare workers without neglecting the root causes of the problems in the healthcare system. For any healthcare worker or any curiosity seeker, St. Denis Medical gives an amazing balance of realism and comedy.",literal
"The mannequins It felt more like sitting through a painfully slow stage play than a film. The entire thing was structured like a spotlight shifting from one actor to another, each delivering a long, dull monologue, one after the other, after the other, all in the same flat, monotone voice. No real emotion. No spark.

It lacked nuance, heart, and honestly any real insight. It was like watching mannequins give TED Talks on shallow philosophies.

I was really looking forwards to a high quality, refreshing, original, romantic comedy, but jokes on me because this was not romantic or funny. I left feeling like I just wasted my time.",literal
"Absolutely love it I am so obsesses with this show. Curently I am on the 9th season an waiting until they release the full 10th season. Those character like Severide, Hermann, Brett or Stella Kidd are amazing. Love it especially because of lots of action and emotional story. If I would have one wish, it would be to be able to watch it from begining like I never see it before. <3.",literal
"Best movie of the year I laughed from beginning to end!! Absolute fan of Alan Ritchson...I would love to see a second one!! Will rewatch again and again!! Even my 15 year old loved this, and THAT'S HARD TO DO!!! I would easily recommend this movie to anyone who loves action/ comedies!! And I really loved that they included the outages at the end of the movie!! This is a MUST SEE!!",literal

Cool creepy creatures in the end, great job with that. That gets you two stars. Long and tedius and not worth your time. Nice camera angles gets you a star. That's not enough.

Great show for people that like comedy This show is a good background show. Doesn't make you think and has some good writing it would be great if they incorporated more interactions with the customers at the dmv. There are some scenes that could use more depth when it comes to making sure the story is complete across the episodes. Excited to see where and how the characters relationships grow when it comes to what actually happens at the DMV.,literal
"Lost it's charm as the seasons are going by.... Up until Season-7, I've been really really enjoying the show. The stories were interesting and so were the medical cases. I learnt quite a few medical terms because of this show and that was a big added advantage. But, Season-8 onwards, really felt that the show went more inclined towards the characters' stories and less towards the medical cases and the thing that really put me off was the pace at which they were killing and making important characters exit from the show. After that, I left it in between. It feels that they should stop stretching it like a stretchy-band and end the show before more people downgrade the show's rating.",literal
"needs a few changes Jim Hanson (Liam Neeson) has a shrinking property on the American Mexican border. The bank is foreclosing on what's left of his property including the hill where he spread his late wife's ashes. Her medical treatments had drained their life savings. He often finds illegals crossing his property. One day, he comes across Rosa and her son Miguel. They're on the run from the Mexican cartel. Jim gets into a gun battle and kills one of the cartel gunmen. Rosa is killed. Eventually, Jim is on the run with Miguel. Jim's stepdaughter Sarah Pennington (Katheryn Winnick) is a border agent.

This needs a few script changes including several situations during the final confrontation. There are some bad old fashion holdouts with the ending. Jim would never lay down his gun. As soon as that happens, both him and the kid would be killed. The biggest change I would make is to get rid of the money. It muddies Jim's motivation in helping Miguel. It would also heighten the danger by taking away a resource. In addition, Jim should have used the money to buy a car. The bad guys know the car and he knows the bad guys know it after the corrupt cop. It's also shot up to heck and on its last legs. Another change is Miguel's declaration that he wants to go home. Here's the deal. The kid is written as a real smart character. He wouldn't be dumb enough to want to go home where he can expect certain death. Overall, I like this lone marine who wants to do the right thing and Liam Neeson playing it. The script for this simplistic story has a few flaws that needs cleaning up.",literal
"A gem! This was a great series. I've learned so much about President Garfield. I only knew of him, in name only via list of US Presidents. Nothing else. What a great president he could've turned out to be, had he lived through his first term. Again. This was a great series. Watch it. You will not be disappointed.",figurative
"A Long-ass Live Action Episode of South Park Title says it all 7/10. A long-ass live action episode of South Park. With Joaquin Phoenix's character study something that I could only describe as Mr. Mackey meets Randy Marsh (South Park)

"Not good They need a new medical consultant. There are so many mistakes in the show. It makes me cringe. In the middle of a major catastrophe, the doctor orders stat IV antibiotics. There were at least 30 different kinds of IV antibiotics and no nurse worth their salt or license would just pick one without a specific order. The acting is horrible and really, who cares about that obnoxious Dr who lost her memory? She's still obnoxious! She still thinks she knows everything so really it's hard to watch a show when you don't care about the main character and you're supposed to have compassion for her but all I have is disdain.",literal
"A sad account, in every sense of the word, particularly however, with the liberties it takes. While Evan Peters certainly deserves accolades for his particularly engrossing and gripping personification of the monster that was Dahmer, the series - the first half of which was excellent - leaves much to be desired.

Note: A special mention should also be made of actor Shaun Brown who delivered a stellar performance in his portrayal of Tracy Edwards, Dahmer's last would-be victim.

Like a good book that you just do not want to put down and which leaves you wanting to know what the next page will bring, the first episode of ""Dahmer, Monster"" is compelling enough that if you have the time, you will not even think about turning off episode two.

The issues, for me, began around episode 5. This is when the story began to move away from Dahmer and his actions somewhat, and began to concentrate on other aspects of the case and the people who surrounded him. This disconnect just grew and grew into the ensuing episodes, with Dahmer being present, less and less. While some viewers may not have minded this, and perhaps viewed it as being 'thorough', to me, it was fluff and fill. There's is no convincing me that this series would not have benefitted from being two episodes shorter. In fact, you could turn it off at episode 6, and could truthfully say you saw it in its entirety, ...or at least all its best parts.",literal
"I was kind of expecting more The first episode felt a little bit too... average, but definitely NOT bad at all!!!, the premise of the show is really good but i wish they re-introduced all the characters instead of making it feel like watching the pilot is required to understand the show, i really disliked that, the songs are VERY good tho.

The few things that i kind of dislike was the excessive swearing by adam, like he's supposed to be an angel but acts exactly like an average hellborn, he was kind of annoying, and i wish his meeting with charlie was longer, it felt too rushed and the pacing of the show feels too fast, also velvette's voice doesn't really fit her but it's not bad, and while brandon rogers voicing katie is not bad i still prefer the old voice actor.",literal
"A fantastic show It is rare that a spin-off of a show is better than the original. Law & Order: Special Victims Unit has managed to fit into that category. With its dark themes, great writing, gripping story lines, and fantastic characters, Law & Order: SVU surpassed the original Law & Order in my own opinion. This show is a must watch for TV fans everywhere. I do not believe this show has ever had a bad episode. Every episode hooked me enough that I didn't want to get up from my couch. Many episodes had me on the edge of my seat. It is rare for me to be genuinely excited for a seven-hour TV marathon, but this show makes me want to sit and watch it all day. I'd definitely recommend it to my friends.",literal
"AI generated script. Prove me wrong. What is this movie? If actors don't make movies that are bad, what script did they read and what happened along the way. Nothing but inane dialogue, plot points that make zero sense and an atrocious story overall. Dave Franco does some line readings like a junior high theatre production. The best trick this movie pulls is getting people to see it.",literal
"What a light-hearted, deep-hearted unexpected joy! I saw this without any particular expectations.

I loved it.

What first started as a funny comedy with a little espionage twist later moved on to very deep, heart-warming, also stern episodes about old age, alienation, adaptation, denial, loneliness and resilience. And human encounter.

Ted Danson, oh Ted Danson, what a joy to watch, a truly superb actor who turns everything he does, from Cheers to Damages, into something remarkable.

It was also moving to watch Margaret Avery again and remember her fantastic role at The Color Purple. She is as splendid now as then.

A final super bonus, and I mean super, is the score. Every chapter closes with the perfect and delightful song, so well chosen!

I will be waiting for the next season with pleasure.",literal
No longer the great! Season 23 has been the worst season of the series. It was supposed to be one of the best in many with the return of Stabler. Sadly after watching for about 15 years and have seen every episode I'm no longer a fan. It's lost what it once had.,figurative
"Puts you right in the thick of it... Creator R. Scott Gemmill knows his way around the medical field via the classic series, E. R. Now gloves are off for The Pitt, showing warts and all in this adrenaline pumped hospital series where each episode is an hour of the day shift in an emergency ward. Within two hours (in 2 episodes) there is so much that happens, that it even makes the viewer overanxious! To top it all off, there are flashes to the pandemic chaos in the emergent ward, where even that is enough to trigger anybody with PTSD from that period. An intense series that reveals what the poor staff go through each hour of what seems to be an eternity in damnation. Glad it is a weekly screening, because I sure need that break, and I'm only watching this from the comfort of my armchair...",literal
"Just Marvelous! FOR SHORT: Hilarious, engaging, full of F bombs, comic and mysterious!

I've truly enjoyed every part of it!! Just what we need it!

I am not sure where to start or what to say but wow! Show, WONDERFUL! The cast, AMAZING! Steve and Martin, perfect like always! Ms. Gomez is the secret sauce of the recipe. I was surprised and very pleased with her acting. Her character has a dry humor and personality, and she is giving us just that... which I also enjoyed. These 3 humans are surprisingly a dynamic trio! Can't wait for Aaron Dominguez to fully come in the picture, I'm very eager to see him as well.

THE LONG (OMG) review: The Beginning of this series took me off guard completely. The way Mabel was found in a very compromising scene, it surprised me. That was a great start! Like oh alright, you want my attention, CHECK. Curiosity, CHECK! Questionable, CHECK CHECK CHECK. Lol!

Why was she full of blood, and who AND why was there someone body there!?

And then.... It takes you back in time. And more questions come up. The mystery begins!

She actually knows him, and knows what he had done?

Why is he so curious for that ring?

Where was all that Jewelry from?

He is supposed to be already out of jail, where is he?

Was it a revenge?

Was it really someone from the building?

Was it an outsider?

Was it one of them?

Why was that note on the door?

Was the dog poisoned? If do, ill he make it?

There was only 4 listeners, and threats were being already made!

The more I think about it, the more questions that arise! I'm loving it! Lol!

To conclude; I don't typically watch TV, but this show keeps me wanting more (I binge watched all 3 episodes). I want every episode to be released already, BUT at the same time I don't want it to come to an end. (Can anyone else relate?) I have never ever done a review, EVER, on ANYTHING! But I had too for this. I wish I could say more to make this helpful to other's interest but that would be giving too much away for those who will start watching it after these reviews!

You must watch it! GO! You won't regret it!

If you read this far, omg you are awesome!",literal

"The Original is the Best! You don't have to look far to find quality TV. Law and Order has been doing it for almost 20 years. Forget about CSI and Cold Case and other imitators out there nothing tops Law and Order. Even though recently new characters that have been coming into play (almost the entire cast has changed in just the last 3 seasons leaving Lt. Van Buren and new DA Jack McCoy as the only long standing characters with Detective Ed Green's sudden departure last season)the show is still going strong and is still interesting. Even the reruns are great to watch. There are some episodes that you can really just get into.

"Perfect As a huge fan of the first one this one was so perfect it was a lot darker and scarier than the first which fits it really well as the movies sort of grow with the audience and the talent these actors have is unreal, honestly mason did so well as finn its insane to see his character diversity and miguel was so good as Ernesto he did such a great job at making Robin and Ernesto so different but also similar in small ways and madeleine really made the movie her acting was insane and she is definitely going places with this crazy performance they are so talented it's wild but yeah this movie doesn't feel like a cash grab at all after watching it I feel like it was so important to the story it just worked so well.",literal

Gritty and Cartoonish! I was expecting Sisu to be a little realistic on the action side.... well I was completely wrong. Sisu is a gritty and cartoonish ride with our Lead character killing numerous Nazis throughout. The killings in this movie are brutal but at the same time over exaggerated. The movie kept my attention throughout but at the same time I realized that the plot and script was pretty ultra thin. I won't share any spoilers here but it won't be hard to lose track on what is happening in this movie. There are plenty of other films similar to this that are far more superior. Still Sisu does warrant a viewing or two. Sisu gets a 6 solid stars out of 10.,literal
"Death by Lightning I would love nothing more than to see this movie edited, removing the language that was not accurate for the time period and removing the scenes with graphic nudity. Terrible choices for an otherwise amazing show. I do understand that historical fiction will always take liberties, especially with dialogue, to fill in the story. The swearing was jarring because it just didn't belong.

In a perfect world if Death by Lightning were edited it would be a joy to watch. The acting was fabulous. The sets and the scenery and the costumes were just beautiful. I admit I knew nothing about Garfield or his presidency and I found the story amazing. This would have been a 10 out of 10 for me.",figurative
"A movie to remember I would first love to start off by saying that it was a wonderful movie over all and was most enjoyable. I am a person who has been in musical theatre (non-career) and has enjoyed it in many forms. I love it so much. I am an instrumentalist and vocalist (as background).

Pros: 1. The set, costumes and visuals!!!! Absolutely stunning and made me super appreciate all the work that everyone put in 2. Obviously biased but the source material 3. Glinda (Arianna Grande). I went into the movie not expecting much of her. Boy did she prove me wrong!!! She was amazing! She played glinda spectacularly. Loved for glinda energy and I'm sure Kristen Chenoworth would have had a way torch to pass on.

4. THE ORCHESTRA. Underrated as anything!!! Support the wonderful orchestra! They did amazing!!!!

5. The relationship with elphaba and fiyero. Is sooo much less awkward then in the musical 😭

Cons: 1. Auto tune of the leads.... I understand that because I'm the movie they did live recording of the singing they would've had to tweak it but at some points the autotune was too much. Like some of the unison and harmonies didn't have the timbre of non-autotuned recordings which bugged me (mainly cause I have watched a performance of it live) but regardless I believe I could have been blended together.

2. Elphaba. I will say that Cynthia did a commendable job and I'm glad that she's getting recognition for her amazing voice. All I wish to say is that she changed elphaba's character. Some of my friends who I watched it with (who haven't seen any form of the musical before) found her even annoying to an extent. I was mainly how she reacted to the people around her skin colour. Almost no one mentioned it but yet she had a gipe with everyone. Normal elphaba tries to act above everyone and like she doesn't care (while deep down she does). This makes normal elphaba more likable and justified in her actions.

3. Pacing. I am a very patient person when it comes to long movies. However, I do agree with many comments when they say that it didn't need to be that long. The original musical was about the same length as the movie (aka the first act). They probably could of kept it more concise.",literal
"Best comedy since Friends A young couple, Sam (Rose McIver) and Jay (Utkarsh Ambudkar), inherit a haunted mansion and, unaware of their invisible housemates, plan to turn it into a B&B. Their lives become much more complicated after a fall causes Sam to see the ghosts.

I have been bereft of quality comedy since Friends ended in 2004. But Ghosts came along and filled that void. Ever since I watched the pilot I was hooked, and I can honestly say that at the end of season 4 I have not disliked a single episode.

One of the rare things to happen in comedy is when you get an ensemble cast with not one single weak character. Every single character of the extended cast is well defined, and excellently portrayed by the actors. So much so you can't even see them as NOT their character in other works.

The only actor I knew before watching this series was Rose McIver, but I love every single one of them now. I laughed and was aghast and was saddened at the storylines, even though it's a comedy it has a broad impact still.

I was overjoyed when I heard seasons 5 and 6 had been greenlighted, I honestly can't wait. A solid and rare 8 for this show from me.",literal

"Severance: A Haunting and Thought-Provoking Thriller Severance on Apple TV+ is a masterclass in psychological thriller and dystopian storytelling.

With a chilling atmosphere, gripping mystery, and stellar performances-especially from Adam Scott-*Severance* explores themes of corporate control, identity, and free will. The unsettling cinematography and haunting score amplify the eerie tone, making it a slow-burn thriller that lingers in the mind. A must-watch for fans of thought-provoking, suspenseful storytelling. Season 2 can't come soon enough!",literal
"Magic without the Spark This sequel sadly fails to captivate with either its story or its plot. The characters feel strangely lifeless, each reduced to a single defining trait that they cling to from start to finish, and their conversations are delivered through dialogue that is as flat as it is forgettable. The chemistry between several of the main characters never quite clicks, either. A romance carried over from previous installments illustrates this perfectly: it's mentioned early on, and from that moment you can see every beat coming. What unfolds is explained through uninspired lines rather than conveyed through genuine performance.

The film is further weighed down by a handful of logical inconsistencies and plot holes, culminating in a twist that simply doesn't land. The magical ""tricks,"" while central to the franchise's appeal, often feel exaggerated to the point of being implausible, which slightly dulls the atmosphere. I also found myself wishing for deeper character development-something the crowded roster of Horsemen makes understandably difficult.

And yet, in spite of all its shortcomings, I still enjoyed my time in the cinema. The movie lives on the playful fusion of magic and heist, and when it leans into its elaborate illusions, it delivers exactly the kind of spectacle you hope for. Watching the tricks unfold and later learning how they were pulled off remains delightfully entertaining. If you're willing to overlook the film's rougher edges and meet it with a sense of childlike wonder, there is still plenty of fun to be had. Even the humor occasionally hits just right, bringing a smile or a brief laugh.

In the final act, the film manages one last flourish-a trick paired with enough action to momentarily sweep you along. Ultimately, it's a watchable experience for fans of the first two entries; for newcomers, the trip to the theater may feel less rewarding. The tease of a fourth installment, and the way it is woven into the finale, unfortunately suggests that the franchise may now be more interested in financial returns than in maintaining its original quality. And that is genuinely disappointing.",literal
"House without the humor or the rudeness. I am very disappointed in this show. I had hoped that it would be much more interesting and about mystery, but instead it is a rehashed version of House MD. I really like Morris Chestnut, but he is giving us Rosewood without the warmth or the humor. After watching two episodes, I am giving this a pass. Given that the creator also gave us Elementary, which I loved, I expected an awful lot more than we are getting. The premise is contrived, the plots are thin, and it just falls short in nearly every category measurable. Perhaps if they had tried to be a mystery, or a medical, or an updated Sherlock Holmes, they could have successfully pulled off something unique. But they have failed on all fronts.",literal

"Why does Disney drag itself through the gutter like this? It is really sad. Despite consistently being criticised Disney doesn't seem to want improve. This show is blander than a coleslaw without dressing and more predictable than Elons rocket launches.

Why is the compulsory Disney gay character always full of spite? He is the team mascot and trips his own team's quarterback on purpose!! No one bats and eye lid!! He should have been fired in episode three. Also he treats people so poorly it's awkward and wrecks the believability of story line. Literally he does not say one kind thing or show any evidence of self awareness.

Also classic Disney, every family is dysfunctional and all the characters act like this is normal and acceptable. The main character's dad literally tells his son he wishes he was dead. Seriously? That's not deep or emotional - it's just dark and awkward and again is unbelievable.

And the swearing... there's so much of it, for no reason at all. The dialogue will put you to sleep - it's gritty, distasteful and reminds me of coffee with the grounds added into it. The only fun part of the show was listening to Glenn Powells southern accent and idioms.

Overall, Chad Powers is classic Disney - in my opinion nothing but forced drama, unoriginal and unnecessary writing, and unrealistic characters you can't root for. It's the way Disney is going and I think it's a mistake.",literal
"Liberties Taken of History, but an Enthralling Adventure. ""A man is not a savage when he shares in your misfortune.""

There's a lot to like here, and a few things to critique fairly. The fighting, the beast, and the main villain invoke a live-action animé feel, while the tragic history of the African transplant along with the romance between Grégoire and Marianne gave the essence of a fairy tale. The debaucherous elitists with their secret society, and their attempt to undermine the providences faith in the King's ability to protect them, is an interesting angle, along with a cultic priest who wants to pervert God's will to make his savage acts be seen as righteous judgment. I would critique though, that generally accepted history shows that the king's lieutenant of the hunt wasn't anything like this fraud of a hunter in this film, and he did, for the most part, destroy multiple beasts that terrorized the countryside. The believed final beast kill of a local hunter of devout faith wasn't even mentioned here, nor the valiant defense of a Mari-Jeane, who her and her friend wounded a beast in an attack against them. The King and the Church had a heavier hand in protecting the people and stopping the threat than what this film reimagines. The angle of an incestuous brother was disarming, and naming the villian after a local hunter and his son who helped as best they could is not cool, but my biggest critique would be the trope of the noble savage versus the mentality that the ""white men can't see or hear"" the natural world and spirits around him. There are many cultures of paler skinned tribes that are either pagan or simply more in tune with nature and spiritualism than the more modern civilized communities. As for the Americas, where Mani came from, the blended communities of native and foreign culture simply makes such writing pale to the nuance of the real world. Still, Mani and Grégoire's potential for punishing groups of bad men (and women) with Conan-like brutality and Dare Devil type combat would be something I'd want to see more of.",figurative
"I really enjoyed this. Despite... As other reviewers have adequately described, it is far away from the Hillermann stories, but that doesn't make it necessarily bad. But one thing I do want to praise is the exceptional 70s soundtrack. Dylan, CCR, Free and many more of my teenage highlights. Wonderful. I am looking forward to Series 3 (if it ever makes it to Netflix).",literal
"Great show, (mostly) great acting, quirky, believable... 6 seasons in and the show has lived up to its early promise. 

Admittedly there have been a few ups and downs, and in my opinion unfair comparisons with the more dramatic hospital shows however this show continues to stand firm as a solid counter to those overly 'OMG! drama of the week' types with its lighter form of dark humour very effectively countering the inherent saddening, and sometimes negative moments that cannot, and should not be avoided by the makers of such shows.

Eddie Falco as the titular Nurse Jackie is the headline name but I give my honours to Merritt Weaver (Zoey Barkow) and Anna Deveare Smith (Gloria Akilitus). Without these two who match our heroine on every level, and sometimes fly above her, the show would come to nought.

Along the way other characters have come and gone, grown and developed, or been the ever present stalwart. A couple have been grating or wearisome at times but overall thankfully there no one who has been truly cringeworthy.

The question now is where does the show go next? What will season 7 bring?

Imo a little tighter writing schedule could have utilised the existing story lines to wind the show up at a grand season 6 finale. I'm concerned that by continuing the show may rely on pushing the TV vs reality boundaries too far following Jackie's inevitable fall from grace as the 'Angelic' nursing figure she so often conveys in public but fails to live up to in her personal life.

I'll keep my fingers crossed and in the meantime recommend this show to all who are fed up with the usual doom and bloom and unrealistic portrait of hospital life. Take a chance with a less hyped half hour viewing...you may well enjoy it more than you thought, I know I did!",literal
"The Town of Derry Gets Darker, Deeper, and Deadlier This prequel series to It by Stephen King manages to revive the horror franchise in bold fashion. Exploring the origins of the evil in Derry and the twisted history of Pennywise. It delivers on atmosphere, vision and lore-expansion, though it doesn't always stick the landing in pacing or character depth.

📺 What It's About

Set in 1962 in Derry, Maine, the series follows the Hanlon family (Leroy & Charlotte plus young son Will) as they arrive in town only to discover children are going missing again. At the same time, a Cold-War era military operation is investigating strange phenomena, drawing the town's darkness into conspiracy and myth.

✅ What Worked

1. The performances especially of Jovan Adepo (Leroy Hanlon) and Taylour Paige (Charlotte). Bring emotional weight and genuine fear to the proceedings.

2. The production design, set in the early '60s, gives Derry a sinister, period feel: the town hides its evil beneath a façade of normalcy.

3. It expands the mythos of Pennywise and Derry in interesting ways. The connection to military operations and a larger supernatural scale give the show new narrative ambition.

4. For horror fans, the series contains some legitimately chilling sequences (especially early on) and a mood that lingers.

❌ What Didn't Work

1. Some critics find the pacing inconsistent. The dual storylines (kids + military) don't always merge smoothly.

2. The horror moments, while strong, may not reach the same level of dread or originality as the best entries in the franchise.

3. Character development for younger characters is viewed as thin by some reviewers. The show sometimes leans on spectacle over connection.

4. For viewers unfamiliar with the previous It films or King's universe, some of the myth-building might feel dense or referential rather than fresh.

💬 Favorite Moments / Highlights

The opening sequence: a child hitchhiker in Derry vanishing in an eerily strange way. Sets the tone immediately.

The military subplot featuring a young version of Dick Hallorann (played by Chris Chalk): a fascinating tie-in to other King-verse stories.

Pennywise's appearances remain haunting, and the show doesn't shy away from gruesome or surreal horror elements.

The atmosphere of Derry as almost another character: the town's history, racism, and hidden evils all intertwine with the supernatural.

💭 Final Thoughts

It: Welcome to Derry might not redefine horror TV, but it is a bold and worthy expansion of the It universe. It draws on rich source material, brings new ideas to the myth, and gives us a chilling journey into the heart of Derry's darkness.

If you're a fan of Pennywise, haunted towns, and horror with substance, this is a must-watch. Just know it takes time to build, and some payoff is still ahead.

Final Verdict: 6.5/10 🎈 Scary, ambitious, and layered with myth while uneven at points, the journey into Derry's past is definitely worth the trip.

🎥 If You Liked This, You Might Also Enjoy

1. The Haunting of Hill House: haunted house, family trauma & horror with soul.

2. Chambers: body/horror + supernatural suspense.

3. It: the feature film this is prequel to; same town, same evil.

4. The Shining: explores overlapping themes and even character ties.

5. True Detective (Season 1): mood-driven horror, small town darkness, myth & menace.",figurative
Unexpectedly good! When I started to watch this it was before there were any reviews written. The title is misleading and the description is off. I expected maybe a witch hunt kind of film but watched something for more complicated and satisfying. Now I know it was based on a book which further explains why it was so much better than expected. I suggest going into blind and just letting the story unfold.,literal
"Worth waiting for. I made the decision to wait for the second part's release to watch it, and I watched the first one, and went straight to the cinema for this, for me it's one long film.

Where do you start? It's a messed up book, with some real dark, crazy horror. Some of it translated here, some of it didn't. The famous scene where Pennywise is first seen I loved, it was terrifying, and from that first moment, I loved Bill Skarsgård, and have nothing but praise for him.

People criticising the run time, clearly haven't read the book, it's a long, but rewarding book. As I now can compare the two films, I preferred this first installment. It's very well made, well acted, definitely enjoyable.

Sometimes it felt more adventure then horror, it never really felt full on horror, there were some very good scenes, but they could have ramped it up a bit. Many people are terrified of clowns, they could have pushed that vibe a bit more. Lots of humour, too much though? Not sure, I didn't detect much humour in the book.

I'm so glad Stephen King is on the big screen still, how about a reworking of The Tommyknockers?

"It sucks big time without Fiona The series was impetuously ,breaking taboos for still many people in and out side USA. For me Ghallegers Comedy ,even with tragic, touching, moving moments was a way to escape from reality of my suffocating, oppressive regime and culture, but it was never as good as the first 9 or 10 seasons with Fiona Character. The beginning of 11th season was a turning point I'll never forget , filming like a documentary about history of Southside Chicago and how Ghallegers were a part of it, imaginary but very believable. However when Fiona character left the series the chemistry between the actors as a family having each other's back, no matter what ,disappeared and I think Fiona worth more credit than the credit given all to Frank. And the finale episode Frank's death while Ghallegers destiny was somehow still vague ,frustrated me, I think there could be a better ending to the series.",literal
"Downer Drama now This show started out great. Great action, firehouse banter & pranks, with drama mixed in. By season 4 the writers have taken the drama too far. It's a downer crisis every single episode. Nobody is happy at thus point, about anything. All the personal drama and crossovers and negativity I'm surprised these actors make it through the day. Sad use of great characters. Get the writers away from TV reality news and get this show back to the mix of banter & firefighting.",literal
"Funny, but slow This movie, about the Griswold family's plans for a big family Christmas that predictably turn into a big disaster, is an okay sequel to National Lampoon's European Vacation (1895).

It's funny, but not as funny as I remember. The pace gets slow sometimes, and it takes its time to get to the next funny moment. The humor is the strong element, and it's a movie that you don't need to pay full attention to, which is sometimes the best in terms of Christmas movies for families. Anyway, it has its own charm and can make you smile or laugh at least a few times.

While this movie offers some humorous moments, its slow pace and lack of sharpness make it a somewhat underwhelming sequel. The movie's charm lies in its relatable family dynamics and the occasional chuckle it provides, making it a decent choice for a laid-back Christmas movie night.",literal
"A by-the-numbers epic where nothing happens. Fantastic songs. I have seen Moana five times. Each time I am captivated by the first half hour. Around the time they get to the giant crab hoarder Tamatoa, the movie runs out of steam and I remember the every last bit of the story. This is easy because there are no details left at that point before the film whimpers through its underrated finale.

There are great themes here, suitable for all ages. This ""princess"" movie should especially be seen by young girls. Disney seems especially good these days at developing female leads that are full of defiance and motivation. The older men are stodgy and fail to make the best decisions on their own. It is nice to see a female take command and not be defined by her relationship with a love interest.

In fact, I say nothing really happens in Moana, and I mean it. Albeit, sort of in a good way. I There is no love story of any kind. Not too long ago, the story of Moana would have ended with her falling in love with yhr only other male character who isnt her dad And ""ick"" at that thought. I am not sure Moana would pass the Bechdel test, as the only female characters are Moana and her grandmother and they only have Moana's father as a talking point, but in this case I would let it slide. The film is well intentioned. I especially love the archetype of the bull-headed prototypcal man being portrayed as an over-artogant fool. The song ""You're Welcome"" flips the script on songs that that are lists of things worth thanking, and Maui takes unwarranted credit for everything. It might as well be called ""The Mansplaining Anthem.""

The music is filled with a lot of the best melodies ever. It's a shame that all of the memorable songs are front-loaded into the first half. Besides ""You're Welcome"", there is the Oscar nominated, ""How Far I'll Go"" and my personal favorite, ""Who You Are."" When I hear that l, it is literally impossible not to hum along with Moana's countermelodic responses.

""We share everything we make.

We joke and we weave our baskets.

The fishermen come back from the sea."" ""I wanna see - ""

Give this team an Oscar.

For something that seems like something Lin-Manuel Miranda did for Disney as a short-sighted favor, the music here is is way better than it has any right to be. This would make a great Broadway musical, albeit one with only two characters and five real songs.

The animation is serviceable, but nothing beyond what we expected in 2016. The water and lava effects are astounding, but I am always surprised by how goodwater and fire effects look in pretty much every CGI animated movie. The struggle between Moana and the volcano goddess is a visual treat and is worth the price of admission.

As of me writing this The sequel was released to tepid reviews. This doesn't surprise me. There are no hooks left in the thread bare story that I wished were further explored. Next on the schedule isn't Moana sequel but a live action Remake. Mayve this one will be Disney's least necessary yet.

Moana is a movie best suited as a 25 minute Disney attraction. Kids should see it, and the songs are keepers.

"Deliciously complicated. Things are not ever what they seem to be. The lesson is, don't judge behavior. Judge intent. The twists and turns in this series are brilliant.

"Its ok. So I just watched a new movie and it's okay. I think the first freaky Friday movie is much better. It was a lot funnier and a lot more entertaining. I think, with this new one, there are so many characters that we keep cutting back-and-forth to all these different characters resulting in the movie being quite long. I think this movie would have benefited for being only an hour and a 1/2 seriously dude, it would have been a lot better that way. Because there were some scenes when the movie just went on and on and on but it's cool to see the original cast or back in this movie and there seems that were funny. We're very funny and entertaining, so I highly recommend seeing the film.

"Breaking Bad is the GOAT🐐!!!!!!!!!! For me it is the greatest TV series of all time.

The show is better written than any other show I have ever seen. The entire storyline is a sweet cake of masterpiece and Walter White's classic character arc is the cherry on top of it.

The story seems like it was well crafted from the very beginning, like every action has a thrilling and/or heartbreaking consequence. It built it's reputation well on its villains. Vince Gilligan's genius embodies 99,1% purely great story.

Mostly I liked the episodes Face off, Ozymandias, Full measure, Salud, and of course Felina. Breaking Bad is one of the few TV shows that delivered a satisfying conclusion. Iconic characters like Walter White, Jesse, Saul, Mike, Hank and Gus were well written.",figurative
"I LOVE THIS SHOW! Where to start .... Carol Burnett: comedian, actress, singer, and so much more. At the ripe age of 90, she's still bringing it. Using almost nothing more than facial expressions, she's absolutely amazing! (No shock there).

Mindy Cohn: Mindy has come a long way from being Natalie Green on Facts of Life. Seeing her here is like revisiting an old friend. She's amazing and such a welcome addition to a top notch cast.

Allison Janney: again, she slides into this part with grace and ease. So talented that she makes it look as easy as putting on a new dress.

Kristen Wiig: I knew that she could act and has been great at comedy, but Palm Royale has debuted a whole new level of talent and ease with this amazing character.

Bruce Dern and Laura Dern: perfection!!! Father and daughter in life, father and daughter in this show. Again, and again, they make it all look so easy.

Ricky Martin: Really surprised me. I hadn't, personally, seen him in years. But ... Here he comes with the chops to not just carry off this part, but to make Robert very endearing.

I could go on about the rest of the cast, but if you've watched this, you already know.

"Dianne Wiest's role is just plain awful I came to the reviews to see how others are feeling about the ""teaching"" scenes with Mrs. McLusky. In my opinion they are preaching, overly opinionated, and are taking something valuable away from the entire show. Mrs. McCluskey is a whiner. Dianne Wiest is simply unable to put out any type of strong woman with a higher purpose type vibe. The other characters are gritty and interesting. Sheridan takes a big misstep with the Mrs. McLusky character.",literal
"ITS PERFECT THE MOVIE. THE SOUNDTRACK. THE SONGS. EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS PERFECT I NEED A SEQUEL ASAP!!!! THIS IS A MUST WATCH. I must say I haven't seen an animated movie this long since spiderman across the spider verse. Please watch this movie, from the character development, to the message it's truly great. My only hope is there is a sequel as I'd love to see more of the cast and characters in this movie. Be prepared to laugh, smile, cry, all of the above. Not a single song in the movie is worth missing, they all now sit in my playlist because of how good all the songs are...like literally amazing.",literal
"Meh The acting in this show is great. The plot however just never really seems to get going. It's a slow burn and every time you think it gonna start getting good...it just let's you down. TBH it's a great idea with great acting just poorly executed. It's one of those shows where you know it could have been so much better if they just didn't try so hard to be ""edgyish"" and ""modern cool"".",literal
"A True Human Film Many of the reasons people are reviewing this poorly are the reason I feel it is a good film: It paints very negative views of modern dating. This is a strength. The film takes a strong point of view in a time when many are afraid to do so.

It's slow. This is a human story, told in real scale, through the beautiful haze of 35mm and realist acting. It is not meant to jump you out of your seat. It is painting with gorgeously long, unusually daring, and meticulously designed shots. Just admire the painting.

Lack of character arcs. I would argue this, but even if we were to rephrase as no drastic arcs, again this is realism. It's deeply human. In normal life, we as humans change very slowly most often, and to see this on screen was beautifully accessible.

Overall, this movie is a beautifully made piece that evokes feelings of classics with its medium and acting, but with modern flair that makes it feel entirely unique and new. A true human film.",literal
"This series never should have been done All of the actors in this series did a great job, specifically Peters who portrayed Dahmer. But that's the only reason to why I give this a 3/10 instead of a 1/10.

I've watched lots of true crime, but this series was something else. Netflix has taken a real life event - peoples real trauma (let me remind you that this did not happen thaaat long ago either) - and made it into a tv-show mixed with fictional events. What makes this different from lots of other true crime that I've seen is that they have real actors (who dresses the same as the real victims and of course are named the same thing as them) who they've used to recreate the scenes of the murderers. If you don't find any issues with this ethically yet, please have in mind that lots of the murderers that are shown in this series have made up stuff thrown in to the scenes which never has never happened just to make it more interesting for the viewer. For example the episode that focused on the very sweet deaf guy that unfortunately met paths with Dahmer, that was not at all how his last day looked like. What make this even more ethically wrong, is that Netflix did not even ask or inform the families of the victims first.

It's awful how hard Netflix are trying to capitalize on so many completely innocent young mens deaths. This series never should have been made. I feel genuinely sorry for the victims families about having to relive this again, I never would have watched it through if I knew everything I've learned from googling the case now after I've seen it.",literal
"Only four episodes in and loving it! I know we are only four episodes in to this series, but I am really enjoying it so far. It is dark, funny, topical and has a little bit of mystery. I am not a huge New York-o-phile, but I appreciate the appeal and the willingness of this series to poke fun at itself. This reminds me of how much I enjoy and have always enjoyed Steve Martin.

I am seatbelted in and can't wait to see where this story takes us.

The series is about a murder in an expensive piece of residential real estate in New York called The Arconia...or at least our three strangers turned podcasters think it's a murder, the police think it is a straightforward suicide. The three strangers, played by Steve Martin, Martin Short and Selena Gomez, all live in the building and are brought together during a fire alarm because of their love of a true crime podcast (the podcast is done by a character played by Tina Fey), everything is not ok in Oklahoma. When the three of them discover there has been a death in the building, they decide to come together to solve it...and naturally do a podcast about it.

Amazing cameos and wonderful melancholy storylines...everyone seems to be hiding something, which is a great set up for a who-done-it.",literal
"Nice build up, poor pay off First one hour and half seem inspired by Magnolia. But the highly ambitious build up maybe was not a good idea, given the rather generic outcome.

The director gives us an interesting premise and some well written characters but unfortunately he is unable to give us a conclusion of equally high standards.

From a very early stage in the film he gives us a hint about why everything is happening (car graffiti). The very simple and silly explanation betrayed to inability of the director to come up with something better than b movie shocks and a cheesy villain that reminded me of the TV shows I used to watch as a kid.

I think it was a serious error to bring supernatural elements in this type of film. The director seems to have forgotten that the sophisticated audience he wants to target, don't believe in witchcraft.

Apart from introducing the villain and her magical spells, there is not much to help the viewer understand why everything happened. The title does not make much sense. We know who the ""weapons"" are but we don't know why they're weapons.

Weapons is a film that thinks its smarter than what it actually is. I suppose it's smarter than some of the viewers, which could explain the overhype.",literal
"Ending I really liked the series and I thought both Jude Law and Jason Bateman gave very good performances.

My main beef is that when he listens to the tape of his brother in the end it gets cut off before he actually starts singing to a very typical New York feel good thats life type montage, where the filmmakers could have really hit the viewer in the feels with a analog casette song by his brother, with a bleek but hopeful ending.",literal
"pure rage I went into the film with high expectations and was unfortunately disappointed. I don't know why I had to watch a completely unhinged woman for two hours as she destroyed herself, her house, and half of her surroundings. What's the point of that? Some people even left during the screening. I was tempted to do the same, but I always try to stick it out until the end, even with films I don't like. And in this case, the ending was just as ridiculous as the rest. I don't think anyone understands what happens at the end.

I have no idea what issue the director is working out with herself, but the film is incredibly angry. Like a two-hour act of violence. Good actors, very good cinematography, but unfortunately extremely bad and annoying music, and this constant, relentless rage... I'm personally 100% in favor of equality between men and women, but unrestrained fury isn't going to get us anywhere either.",literal
"Tries hard but doesn't hit the spot. From the same people who bought you Superstore, you can see some of the same vibe, however, they've clearly been influenced by the success of Abbott Elementary too, but St Denis Medical doesn't managed to capture the magic of either of those shows.

Not a single one of the core characters is likeable. Even a flawed character needs to have some connection to the audience and that isn't what I'm getting from this show.

Wendi-McClendon-Covey has just bought Beverly Goldberg into the 2020s in this role, the two characters are 100% interchangeable.

It's an easy background watch, but it is just lacking something to make it truly magical.",literal
"Just perfect! Death by Lightning was superb, the acting, the story line, and development of the characters! Garfield is a forgotten president. This series allows the audience to wonder, what if Garfield had not been assassinated? Would our course of history been the same? I highly recommend this series! You will be entertained and will learn about Garfield, the man who became our 20th U. S. President.",literal
"99.1% pure One of the greatest shows ever, the pacing is excellent. The characters are well developed and entertaining. The show ties everything together very neatly. It's honestly a show that get's better each time you view it. It's cathartic to see Walter break bad and how the story unravels is the best way it could have. Very good storytelling, well done to Vince Gilligan.",literal
"Everything comes together! Finally a sequel where all questions (including the ones from the first movie) are answered, pretty uncommon for modern thriller movies. In terms of horror it is more intense than the first movie which set the grounds for this one. Beautiful connection between the two movies and the two worlds what action happens. Solid performance from Mason Thames, without him neither the 1st nor the 2nd would have been the same.",literal
"Superman Review! First watch review:

🏆95%

I went into this movie with pretty high expectations. James Gunn might be my favorite comic book movie director, and his previous movie Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is hands down my favorite MCU movie. Even though this wasn't my most anticipated movie of the year, it'll likely end up being my number one favorite movie of the year. I'll try my best to make this review without spoilers. I thought David Corenswet was great as Superman, and Krypto was absolutely adorable. I also really liked Mr. Terrific; he was easily my favorite character in the Justice Gang, and Rachel Brosnahan was decent as Lois Lane. Nicholas Hoult was amazing as Lex Luthor; he's easily in my opinion the most hateable Lex Luther we've ever seen on the big screen yet; he's pretty much pure evil. The movie didn't really go into deep detail about his character, so I do think that the movie could've done more with him, but what we got with him was still very good. The plot twist towards the end of the movie was decent; it wasn't anything crazy, but still, I didn't see it coming. The comedy in the movie is kind of what you'd expect from a James Gunn movie. I didn't think it was anywhere near as funny as the Guardians of the Galaxy movies, but still, there were some funny moments. This movie feels just like a comic book, which is definitely one of the best parts about the movie. I also really liked the message of the movie, and to be honest, I liked the changes they did to Superman's real parents; I actually enjoyed seeing a slight change to it; after a while, getting the same story with them over and over again gets a little old. Overall, this is easily my favorite Superman movie, and this is definitely an amazing start to the DCU!

---------------------------

Second watch review:

🏆96%

Somehow I enjoyed this even more on rewatch, which is crazy since this movie was already my favorite of the year to begin with. This is definitely a top 2-3 DC movie ever. The Dark Knight is still the best, but I'm not sure which is better between this and The Batman; it's definitely very close though. I absolutely love the message of the film. Even though many are different, everyone is still human. Lex Luthor hates Superman because he's an alien, but deep down Superman is even more human than Lex himself. What makes you human is your choices, not what others view you as. It's definitely one of my favorite messages I've seen from any comic book film. Also, the scenes in the pocket dimension are easily the best part of the movie for me. The scene with them falling into the black hole looks absolutely stunning. Overall, Superman is easily my favorite movie of the year, and I can't wait to see Supergirl and Man of Tomorrow!",literal
"Just like the pilot Just like the pilot and I hope it goes so much further in the future and I hope people can see where it came from and not judge it solely by comparison to the latest big budget shows because it never began that way, if you don't like it you don't like it, please don't tank it and remove it from the people who do love it if your not a fan just don't watch it. The story so far is so beautiful, it began much like Helluva Boss but now just as that its characters are becoming more known and the way its done is just unrivaled the pain the characters feel you feel as well, you get pulled into the story just as you would as a kid watching tv, you want more and more because it just feels right. I held my breath for it to be good after the recast and as much as I loved the old cast the new direction is well worth it.",literal
"The best of Sirk. I have always had mixed feelings about some of the Sirk melodramas. ""Imitation of life"" is ""cool"" in the wrong sense of the word, with a bad cast (Lana Turner, Sandra Dee, etc.), poor sets and a general look of fifties sitcom. ""All that heaven allows"" also has its flaws: a ""politically correct"" tone, a postcard look (that awful final shot of the deer) and a horrible and unveliable Rock Hudson.

On the contrary, I think ""Magnificent Obsession"" is the most poignant or Sirk's films. It has a restrained, ""less is more"", mood very different, for instance, from the frenzied and mad bursts of ""Written on the wind"". Take, among others, the sublime scenes of the ""insomnia night"" and its dark tones, the reading of comic strips by the lake or the sweet and serene ending. Here, Hudson and Wyman show a real insight with their characters and are really moving. The paced mood and the soft, pastel colors contrast with the hard driven and violent tones of ""Written ..."" (the red car and dresses, the aggressive performances of Malone and Stack, the ""lubricious"" dance,etc.). These two very different films are, in my view, the best of Sirk: ""Obsession"" tender and moving, ""Written"" violent and crazy.",literal
"On the brink of disappointment Was there a budget cut when it came to ""baby IT""? Sorry, a doll-like head with a side growth, a bat wing, a slimy body and lots of shooting across the set does not make scary. And what was with the demon family? Somebody went wild in editing and chopped off their back story?-Where did they come from? Was suppose to get better idea of IT""s origin, this just made no sense Good IT-inspired tension building at least but time zones confusing. Maybe that bit will out as the series progresses. Giving it a chance.",literal

"More enjoyable than not I had seen a few reviews that said this movie was crap, well, I have to say that I enjoyed 90% of it. Playdate, at times, did feel like Central Intelligence (2016) - I enjoyed that too.

Anyway, Alan Ritchson (Jeff) certainly entertained me with his comedy chops after seeing him in Reacher (2022), The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare (2024) and Fast X (2023) doing all action only stuff.

Not sure if the whole thing worked, it just felt like some gelling was missing. I would recommend this.",literal

"Simply the Finest Christmas Comedy Ever Filmed There is barely room for discussion regarding the fact this is a Christmas comedy that's perfect in virtually every respect. Withing its running time there are some of the funniest moments ever captured on film, holiday movie or otherwise. The script is one of the most hilarious, sharp, and intelligent in cinema history. The direction is inspired and technically it is without a doubt excellent. There is something about it that so stunningly captures the spirit of Christmas and the atmosphere of a family gathering. The cast is nothing less than remarkable, with an astonishing display of incredible talent. Everyone does a superb job and their comic timing is unbeatable. As an ensemble, it is truly a fantastic group effort. This is a director's dream cast and Jeremiah Chechik puts them through their paces as if he had a magic wand. Chevy Chase has never been better and Beverly D'Angelo is utterly amazing. Randy Quaid gives a knockout performance as Cousin Eddie and the motion picture wouldn't be complete without his visit. A yearly favorite at our house and one my late wife looked forward to very much. It is a happy memory of the holidays and always managed to make us laugh even though we've seen it every season since it was first shown on HBO. A funny, lovely gift to everyone for Christmas.",literal
"Ok It is entertaining but far from the masterpiece that they are saying it is.

It is an ok show- well produced, a story line similar to hundreds of shows/movies before it, and a pretty annoying main character.

It really makes me wonder how these shows ""open with incredible reviews"" - the bots probably love this show.",figurative
"Good historical drama, but too long Nuremberg (2025) is a psychological thriller historical drama movie written and directed by James Vanderbilt and is based on the 2013 book The Nazi and the Psychiatrist by Jack El-Hai and it follows a psychiatrist who is challenged with determining if a man is fit to stand trial at the Nuremberg trials. This is a movie that caught my eye only because of James Vanderbilt as it is very different from what he is usually know for. Well, I just got done watching the movie and it was good.

Positives for Nuremberg (2025): The story in this movie is really interesting as it explores a story in time that I am not familiar with. The movie is shot and directed very well by Vanderbilt as you can tell he wanted to do this story justice. The cast does a great job with their performances here and you have a lot of people including Russell Crowe, Rami Malek, Leo Woodall, John Slattery, Mark O'Brien, Colin Hanks, Wrenn Schmidt, Lydia Peckham, Richard E. Grant and Michael Shannon. I also have to say that the production on this movie look really good and it feels like you're being transported into a different lime in life with these people from that era. Vanderbilt did a good job at exploring the themes with the characters and how it effects their journey in the movie. And finally, the dialogue in this movie is really good and it was nice to listen to what these people were talking about.

Negatives for Nuremberg (2025): The movie is way too long for its runtime which I get for the story, but it felt padded out. The pacing is also really bad as it drags the story in such a slog that it gets boring at times. I also felt that the movie wasn't able to balance the themes with the emotional moments that well as they tend to cancel each other out. And finally, the ending of the movie goes on forever and it was annoying.

Overall, Nuremberg (2025) is a very well made historical drama movie with a great story and a great cast, but is let down by the runtime and pacing. Honestly, this is one of those movies that you should wait for it to be available on streaming.",figurative

Just thru the first episode and I'm laughing I love it.. just started episode 2. It's adorable and fun and enjoyable. It's great to have Steve Zahn back and a lot of fun to see Glen Powell taking a role where he downplays his beautiful looks. And he carries it off very well. I like the supporting actors a lot and I'm really looking forward to the entire season. I needed something light and fun and I think this is going to be my favorite comedy for the season.,literal
"It needs some help. It's not ""good"" When Benny's in the outfield talking to Smalls, he tells him, ""Man, ya gotta stop thinking. Just have fun. I mean, if you were having fun, you would've caught that ball."" Later, after Smalls is pulled down from the fence, the boys try to knock some sense into him, with Squints telling him, ""If you were thinking, you wouldn't've thought that."" Even moreover, Smalls had already gotten intimated by the wonderment of what's on the other side of the fence multiple times, so when Porter knocks one over, why would he suddenly not know what everybody's problem is? Also, why the opposite reactions to different boys knocking one over? Porter gets loaded with grief, then Smalls gets compliments all around. How is Porter an ""idiot"", anyway, for hitting it over? It's baseball; it's going to happen and isn't that the whole point? And it's not like you can control exactly how far (or short) you smack it.",figurative

Kristen Bell and Adam Brody were a delight. Don't we all have at least one family member or friend that's a nut case like this? I just think it was a totally believable concept. Then I found out it was based on a true story, all but him being a Rabbi. And so funny, OMG. I convinced one friend who cannot sit still and she even binge the season, lol. Well worth your time.

"Not sure how it could've been better I haven't stopped thinking about this movie since I went to see it and I've been listening to the soundtrack on repeat.

I went to the touring musical many years ago and don't remember being that enamored with it, but this movie was next level magic. Performances by Cynthia, Ariana, and Jonathan were exceptional. Truly stellar voices! I cry at the end of Defying Gravity every time I listen to it. I hope they win all the awards!

I just bought tickets to see Wicked on Broadway again to compare and I can't wait to see the movie again. I honestly would've sat through a full 5-6 hours to see both parts of it.

Sadly the Wicked story is timeless because history continues to repeat itself. There's a lot to learn from it. Highly recommend!",literal
"The Glossy Facade Gives Way To A Studio Classic Looking back on the abbreviated career of Douglas Sirk, ""Magnificent Obsession"" rises above being just another ""woman's film"" or ""weepie"". It actually serves as a notable turning point as it is the first in a string of Technicolor melodramas Sirk helmed at Universal-International, as well as one of his most popular. It also kick-started the malnourished career of Rock Hudson and sent his fame into another realm. Despite the film's lame-brained premise and endless implausibilities, Sirk takes the material and dishes out a sweet, moving drama that is a thinly disguised tale of Christianity.

Hudson stars as Bob Merrick, a millionaire playboy with no cares in the world. His lavish and self-serving lifestyle inadvertently leads to the death of a prominent local doctor, Wayne Phillips. Dr.Phillip's widow, Helen(Jane Wyman)tries to pick up the pieces of her shattered life, while at the same time resisting the advances of Bob Merrick. His persistence results in an accident in which Helen goes blind. In a convoluted and corny twist, Bob tries to redeem himself by giving selflessly to others and devoting his life to medicine to find a way to restore Helen's eyesight.

Every stereotype of every soap opera convention is used in overwhelming doses to tell the story of ""Magnificent Obsession"". The ""alternative lifestyle"" of Christianity that Bob learns is a mish-mash of psychobabble that even the most detail-oriented viewer would find boring and confusing. And the seriousness in which the actors take the material is eye-rollingly unbelievable. But this film is saved by the always-savvy direction of Douglas Sirk(who himself hated the plot)and an elegant, understated Jane Wyman who brought her own brand of sophistication to every role she played - and was Oscar-nominated for this role. Even Hudson is able to overcome his nerves in his first leading, A-list role to give a performance that is convincing. Sirk's use of reflective surfaces and a dominating color palette give this movie a look that is undeniably sheen. And Frank Skinner's classical score takes the ordinary material to an emotional level; although the choral ""oohs and aahs"" on the soundtrack are a bit pungent for such a quiet film. This is not Sirk's best work, but it is definitely solid enough to engage first time viewers and a must for fans of the German-bred director's work.",figurative
"not very good This movie was pretty bad, i didn't buy hardly anything that happend, it all seemed so far-fetched, like Rock Hudson all of a sudden becoming a doctor, and a lot of other stuff too. Rock Hudson and Jane Wyman are only OK but were better in all that heaven allows. Watch All that heaven allows or written on the wind instead.",literal
"A fun action movie with a nice amount of social satire sprinkled in for good measure ""The Running Man"" is a sci-fi action-thriller film based on the 1982 novel of the same name by Richard Bachman (a pen name for Stephen King). Directed and co-written by Edgar Wright (The ""Three Flavours Cornetto"" trilogy, ""Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World"", ""Baby Driver"", ""Last Night In Soho"") and starring Glen Powell in the lead role, it functions as a fun action movie with a nice amount of social satire sprinkled in for good measure.

In the distant future, the global economy is on the verge of collapse, with America quickly falling under the reigns of a totalitarian government just to save itself from ruin. Desperate to provide for his wife and infant daughter, the financially destitute Ben Richards (Glen Powell) auditions to appear on ""The Running Man"", a gladiatorial government-monitored reality TV show where its contestants known as ""Runners"" have the opportunity to win huge cash prizes if they are able to survive 30 whole days out in the world without being brutally killed. After Ben is selected to compete, he is given a 12-hour head start to avoid the ""Hunters"", a group of skilled hitmen hired by the TV network to kill Runners on sight by any means necessary. Though he manages to evade the deadly Hunters at first, Ben's survival options soon start to run out as he eventually finds himself dealing with other dangerous matters like violently obsessed fans of the show, underground conspiracy groups, and media manipulation designed to slander his reputation.

The longer things continue the way they are in the world, the more prophetic many dystopian stories from many years ago seem to become in retrospect. One prime example of this would be the 1987 action thriller film ""The Running Man"", which despite taking place in the then-distant future of 2017, still correctly predicted some frightening technological and social detriments to humanity that are very much still a problem today. This includes the general public's obsession with reality TV, a genre that continues to draw in strong ratings the world over, and deepfakes, a digital alteration of superimposing someone else's face onto another one's body. In the years since that film, the technological and sociological landscape has only gotten worse, with even more issues arising that even Stephen King couldn't have foreseen back in the 80s. In this 2025 remake of ""The Running Man"", we are shown a film that closer resembles King's story, complete with most of the original satirical look at humanity's decline and the technology used to exacerbate this downturn.

Unlike the original 1987 movie, where Arnold Schwarzenegger's character of Ben is thrust into the spotlight completely against his will, this film's version of Ben voluntarily puts himself in danger's way for the selfless reason of helping his family. When we first see Ben, he is in the office of his former boss begging to be re-hired after he was previously fired due to his short temper and overall bad attitude. As a means to gain some sympathy, Ben cradles his infant daughter Cathy in his arms during his attempt at bargaining, but his ex-boss sees through this and promptly asks him to leave. With his family's finances swiftly depleting, Ben decides to audition for the highest rated reality TV show of all time; ""The Running Man"", where if he can survive for 30 days, will win over $1 billion in prize money.

This is where the film begins to establish the social hierarchy within its dystopian world, as the contestants on reality TV shows like this are always low income workers desperate to pull themselves out of financial hardships at the sick amusement of the wealthy upper class. When a contestant, otherwise known as a ""Runner"", is set off on their mission of survival, they have little to no means of supporting themselves other than with their own wit and determination. To make matters worse for them, Runners are also in danger of being exposed by loyal viewers who can also win money by correctly identifying and killing them live on TV, something of which is actually encouraged by the show's producer Dan Killian (Josh Brolin) and host Bobby Thompson (Coleman Domingo). As a result, you really get the sense that the odds are truly against Ben in this unfair game, something of which proves extra helpful in prolonging the film's entertainment value.

As he's shown us with most of his previous work, Edgar Wright is a master at pacing his movies, and this one is no exception. In spite of its runtime of 133 minutes, the film is quick, erratic, and never boring thanks to Wright's ability to keep his audience focused on what is happening without the need to cut away to something different prematurely. Though I think this does come at the cost of some pivotal moments that could have fully immersed the viewer in an important scene, most of the time you are so caught up in the action and quick nature of what is happening that you tend to overlook these parts at the best of times. After all, it's no easy task to make a two hour plus movie move at such an efficient speed.

Additionally, Wright also does a decent job at showing the dangerous nature of living in this dystopian world where ""The Running Man"" is not only a popular show for people to watch but also every poor person's last ditch attempt at climbing the social and economic ladder. This is proven by the fact that it is often mentioned throughout the story that nobody has actually lasted the full 30 days of ""The Running Man"", with the closest anyone has gotten being a mere 29 days. As mentioned earlier, this can all be traced back to the unfair rules imposed by the corrupt television executives who care more about ratings than human life. For instance, Runners constantly have their faces posted up on large buildings and on passing vehicles for everyone to see, as well as what they could look like if they were wearing a disguise. Because of this, moments where we see Ben wearing a fake moustache on a train or dressing up as a Catholic priest in a pub could easily go horribly wrong for him if just one person there is able to identify him from memory alone.

Once again proving himself a capable leading man, Glen Powell finds ways to strike a nice balance between a normal everyman and a tough action hero in his depiction of Ben Richards. In fact, it is established right away that this film's version of Ben cares more about what he is competing for rather than him becoming a celebrity for the show's audience to admire, as he driven solely by the desire to win money to give his family a better life. Despite that, whenever push comes to shove, this Ben can certainly hold his own in physical combat. Because of that, I much prefer Powell's Ben over Schwarzenegger's Ben, as in hindsight the latter is just another typical 80s muscle-bound lead role among many for Arnie.

Though this is mostly a one-man show, there are a handful of memorable moments from the supporting cast, including Josh Brolin as Dan Killian, the calculating, ratings-obsessed executive producer of ""The Running Man"", and Coleman Domingo as the charismatic host Bobby Thompson. I particularly liked watching Ben interact with Dan, since they offer a nice contrast between upper class and lower class opinions on how things function in this dystopian world. Naturally, the two have differing views on this matter, which sets up for an interesting finale. Likewise, Bobby is an attention-grabbing presenter who knows how to draw in large crowds to watch others literally kill the contestants of the show he hosts. At his core, Bobby is not that much different from most real-life reality TV show hosts, which makes his character disturbingly believable within the context of this movie.

Thanks to the mostly reliable efforts of its star, director, and faithfulness to its source material, the 2025 version of ""The Running Man"" is a worthwhile reimagining that I believe wins out over the 1987 adaptation. Granted, there are parts that could have been better had Edgar Wright decided to focus primarily on establishing a more pessimistic atmosphere, but I still think the film manages to be as entertaining and thought-provoking as the original novel in the grand scheme of things. With that said, you can still enjoy this movie as either a standard action flick or a satirical analysis of reality TV as a whole, both of which are aspects that I think worked just fine here. For those reasons alone, the film should have little trouble finding at least one satisfied audience.

I rate it 7/10.",figurative
"What's With The Gloves ?? It's absolutely no surprise that Kim Kardashian is a crap actor but the cringe writing isn't helping All's Fair either. I really hope that Sarah Paulson got paid extra money to say some of the horrible lines she had because they were mortifying to hear. I get that most of the women have worked with Ryan Murphy in the past and probably have some kind of relationship with him but I have to believe that Glenn Close is either being blackmailed or she needs the money. There's no other explanation for an actor of her caliber appearing in nonsense like this. Also why on earth are all of these professional women wearing gloves to work ?? I could see if it was just one character and that was her thing but multiple characters are wearing gloves to the office ?? Ridiculous

How is Emerald a partner in a law firm when she's not even a lawyer ?? Allura is supposed to be such a smart divorce attorney but she married someone without a prenup ? I watched the three episodes that are out so far and the dialogue gets worse with each episode. .",literal
"Such a clever and entertaining show! Such a clever and entertaining show! Definitely one of my favorites now. It perfectly blends drama, dark humor, and mystery, making it hard to stop watching. The cast is absolutely spot-on-every actor feels like they are their character, with all their quirks and flaws. The performances are so good that you can't help but feel a rich palette of emotions for everyone on screen.

What I really loved is how the show highlights human weaknesses and everyday vices. It's almost like holding up a mirror to society but with a sharp and witty edge. The big mystery about who dies keeps you guessing, and the twists along the way make it sooo satisfying.

The locations are absolutely stunning! Season 2, the Sicilian setting, with all its art and history, adds so much depth. There's also so much symbolism woven into the story, especially in the second season, which makes it fun to think about even after you're done watching.

Overall, it's smart, funny, and beautifully shot. Definitely worth checking out!",literal
"FBI Season 1&2 review. A show with good case to case qualities, but poor main story and side plot writing! However is an o.k watch. Pros: Costume designs in the show are excellent. It's a very attractive looking show. The atmopheres are pleaseing to the eye. Good makeup. Good actors, and nice casting for the characters. Good dialect and language style for the characters. Everything looks FBI orientated. Nice sound, and scene editing. Some of the short stories are cool, and give an edgy feel to the audience.

Cons: The title of the show is basic! Main plot, subplot, character development, and antagonist are basically non-existant in this show. There is no main story plot because each episode is strongly case to case based. There's not really any sideplots for the main characters.

Main character development is very poor. They all have hearts made out of stone! You dont really get to see into their lifes, emotions, or connections, outside or inside the FBI offices. Because of this, you can't invest in the characters.

Overall: It's an o.k show, with interesting mature subject matter. However, things become repetitive. A good portion of the: main plot, side plot, and character development writing skills is flimsy at best. There is not enough follow-through with that stuff, into the next episodes.",literal
"This movie keeps you I think what defines a movie above or below a 5 of 10 stars is based on whether it keeps you watching or compels you to multitask. Then whether under a 4 or above a 6 is based on the quality of picture and dialogue. I give this movie a 7. It kept me comfortably and the plot was ordered well. I would change the part about the dog and burning the money. If the dog was injured then healed the same point would have been portrayed and would add additional sensation of feel good there after. Also burn half the money and keep other half for emergency. Same point would have been made and would have added wit as well. Still though, good movie and well done. 👍",figurative

"The fact that people are still writing... The fact that people are still writing about how wonderful the movie is tells you a lot. As I look at them I am struck that they all seem positive. My son has watched this movie several times, and asked for it for Christmas. Each time he watches it it sparks a new conversation, and questions about real life issues. As a Mom, I think this movie is wonderful. When I watch this with him, I wish he had a group of friends like they are. They all seem to really have respect for each other. It is a ""Stand by me"" kind of movie, and I would like to see more of them.I seems like the kind of movie that can encourage people to be better people. This is a great movie for young boys and families.",literal
Can everyone stop complaining Only episode 1&2 have come out so far and I'm impressed if it continues on this track this show will go down well. I don't understand the reviews saying it's not historically accurate just shut up and watch the damn show. Stop analysing every little bit that don't matter. This is fun and good so far.,literal
"Wow This show really surprised me. I thought it was going to be another one of those run of the mill crime dramas where you can never truly connect emotionally with any of the main characters. But instead Task gives the audience an intricate perspective into each of the main characters life's.

There are many ""I didn't see that coming"" moments so far and the writing is very good. Its a very gripping fast paced show at times but it knows when to slow down and let the story breathe. The acting from everyone involved is great as well and the cinematography at times is quite beautiful.

If your on the fence about watching Task like I was a few weeks ago, check it out. It is easily the best show that has come out this year so far.",literal
"Simply brillaint I remember watching Fin Cole since his days on Peaky Blinders and while he physically looks the same, he certainly shows his skills throughout this show. It's hard to work out what he actually feels about his family but the hatred at times shines through, especially knowing they lived a mile away and didn't do anything to save his Mum. Smurf cast her out of the family and J has never forgotten that. As the show moves through the seasons and you become more involved in the show and characters, I found myself liking Pope more and more. At first he seemed really creepy, especially standing over J's girlfriend in the bedroom but the more you learn about Pope, the more you feel for him.

I REALLY like this show :)",figurative
"Loved it! A great series! Very funny, brilliant story, great characters and makes me want to go to New York Desperately. I'm not a true crime fan, and you definitely don't need to be to watch this either.",literal
"Isn't funny and has no storyline. This movie's entire storyline is ""things keep going wrong"". This makes for a boring viewing experience. I kept waiting for a plot to show up but none ever did. I don't require lots of action or drama from a movie, but I do require some sort of concrete story, and this film lacks that.

Also, although this film is in the comedy genre, there isn't anything really funny in it. Basically the only humor comes from slapstick comedy and stereotypical characters (senile old people, rednecks, snooty rich people, etc.). There are also some ""relatable"" scenarios that are supposed to be funny (like struggling to put up Christmas lights) but all of these are too cliché to be laugh-worthy. I suppose it's possible that they were original for their time, but modern audiences won't appreciate them.

In conclusion, don't watch this movie unless you have some kind of nostalgic attachment to it or REALLY like slapstick comedy.",literal
"Closer to the Mary Shelley novel than most...but in some ways even better than the Shelley story! One of my favorite novels is Mary Shelley's ""Frankenstein"". However, nearly every version I have seen take HUGE liberties with the story...and are barely even the same story. This is especially true of the most famous, the 1933 version...which I love but just isn't the Shelley story. As far as this Del Toro version goes, it's much closer to the Shelley version than most...but when it does depart, I mostly like Del Toro's choices. Sure, Frankenstein isn't Swiss in this version and the ending is VERY different....but I loved it nonetheless.

I'm not going to spend my review talking about the plot. Nearly everyone knows the basic story. But instead I want to talk about some very positive ways the story is improved upon by Del Toro. In this version, the guy whomade the moster is much more villainous and awful...and really easy to hate. And, the 'moster' isn't all that monstrous except when people try to harm him or folks he loves...making the 'creature' much more sympathetic and likable. And, as a result, I found myself brought to tears on several occasions. Overall, the film hits all the right buttons...making it the best version of the story to date...sumptuous and with tons of humanity...it's the one to see...especially on a big screen.",literal
"Oh so bad I'm offended at how dumb this movie is. There's funny, there's silly, then there's stupid. This movie is stupid. And this is coming from someone who's very easily entertained and amused.

You steal a car and there just happens to be two kids headphones at the back, same as in the car you just ditched? No one in the film crew noticed?? You give up the clone kid to save your wife, and without the baddies releasing her, you immediately set out to get him back?? Then you just blow up the baddies' den with no info on the wife's whereabouts. What foolishness is this?

Even as a kids' comedy movie, this is a spit in the face of our intelligence as humans. An hour and half of brain-rot.",literal
"A Lifeless Attempt at Medical Mystery CBS's ""Watson"" feels like it was created by an algorithm that watched ""House, M. D."" and ""Rosewood"" but failed to understand what made those shows compelling. Following Dr. John Watson (Morris Chestnut) after his partnership with Sherlock Holmes, the series attempts to blend medical mysteries with detective work, but the result is a tepid, by-the-numbers procedural that lacks both shows' distinctive charms.

Where ""House"" thrived on Hugh Laurie's caustic wit and brilliant characterization, and ""Rosewood"" succeeded through Morris Chestnut's charismatic portrayal of an optimistic pathologist, ""Watson"" provides neither. Despite Chestnut's proven talent, his Watson feels constrained by flat writing and predictable storylines. The show seems afraid to let him be either abrasive like House or charming like Rosewood, leaving the character in a bland middle ground.

The medical mysteries themselves lack the intellectual complexity that made ""House"" engaging or the local flavor that gave ""Rosewood"" its Miami pulse. Each case follows such a formulaic pattern that you can practically set your watch by when the first wrong diagnosis will occur or when the obligatory personal connection to the patient will be revealed.

While Morris Chestnut remains as charismatic as ever, both his Watson and the supporting cast just aren't clicking. The ensemble lacks the spark that made shows like ""Rosewood"" so engaging, and it's particularly frustrating knowing that the entire ""Rosewood"" cast is currently available - making one wish CBS had opted to revive that superior show instead. The show tries to create tension through Watson's past connection to Holmes, but these references feel more like name-dropping than substantial plot elements. The chemistry between characters is virtually non-existent, making their interactions feel forced and professional to a fault.

Production values are adequate but uninspired. The hospital setting looks like every other medical show's set, and the visual style lacks distinction. Even the music seems pulled from a stock ""tense medical moment"" library.

The biggest disappointment is how ""Watson"" wastes its unique premise. The idea of exploring Holmes's former partner as a medical professional could have been fascinating, but instead of diving deep into Watson's psychology or how his time with Holmes shaped his medical approach, we get surface-level procedural fare.

In trying to appeal to fans of both ""House"" and ""Rosewood,"" ""Watson"" ends up satisfying neither. It's not unwatchable, but in today's crowded TV landscape, being merely adequate isn't enough. This is especially frustrating given Morris Chestnut's proven ability to carry a medical show, as demonstrated in ""Rosewood.""

If you're craving medical mysteries, you're better off rewatching ""House."" If you want Morris Chestnut solving cases with style, return to ""Rosewood."" ""Watson"" proves that sometimes, the best elements of two successful shows don't add up to a compelling new one.",literal

"Two Things I Don't Do Two things ai don't do is watch horror movies without seeing a trailer and fall asleep in a theaters. Well I did both with this movie, I have to stick to rule #1 always watch the trailer. Could have talked my daughter into seeing anything else. I do mean anything else.

"A once great show, now a fan-fiction. What this review might have sounded like had I written it 7 years ago. 

The first few seasons are, for the most part, extremely fantastic, focused, funny, fresh, intelligent and even at times, brilliant...Must see TV!

What this review sounds like now nearing the end of the shows run. 

A once great show which slowly starts to diminish around season 4, unfortunately. By the 9th season it seems as though the pen and paper have been handed over to teenage fans of the show...Decent background noise. 

To conclude. 

This show was once incredible, and something fresh, even at times brilliant. I couldn't wait for each new episode. Now, I watch it when it becomes available on a streaming service, and, on rare occasion you get a great episode, but it's not worth devoting a weekly schedule and sitting through all the fan-fiction episodes and story lines to get to the good stuff. The show can still be enjoyable, without question, though I find it better suited as background noise while doing work instead of must see TV that you're excited to tune in as it airs each week.",literal

"Boring cliche plots with characters you don't care for Really not much to say about it. I keep trying this series again and again considering it's rating here but my god it's just boring, and all the characters are either annoying, boring or cliche. There isn't even humour to save it. I actually watched the first seasons but each time a new one comes out I've forgotten the first because it was so forgettable. Eventually just couldn't keep watching. And yes I'm including first seasons too. Don't care for any of the characters and don't believe any of the relationships between the characters. I think poor writing is the culprit in this case.........",literal
"Season 2 is slow Not gonna lie, the first season was a ROLLERCOASTER of emotions. It moved at perfect speed, leaving me begging for more at the end of each episode. It is in my top 5 favorite tv shows based on season 1 alone.

Then, something happened. Season two came along and did an excellent job of story framing and gap filling in the first two episodes. After that, it feels like the last 8 episodes could have been condensed into 4 episodes. There was SO much filler and ""artistic"" shots that lasted far too long, in my opinion. One of the things I love about this show is that they don't hit it too on the nose with information and explanations. They use a ton of inferences and a ""connect-the-dots"" approach to help you gain an understanding of who we are, where we are, and why we are here in the story.

That said, a MASSIVE amount of information was either left untold, OR it went right over mine and my partner's heads. I know there are some theories online about what Cold Harbor really is and what it all means, but unless there's a season 3, we are extraordinarily disappointed in the season 2 finale. If this is the end of the series, what a colossal failure it was to end the show in the way that they did. I would have given a perfect 10 had they answered the BIGGEST detail I was dying to know. Maybe they get off on that...maybe it was intentional to play with my emotions and curiosity like that. If so, well played, BENNY STILLS!

Still, 8/10.",figurative
"A step in the right direction Jurassic World Rebirth is a solid, fun ride that treats us with great action/suspenseful scenes (which reminded me of Jaws) and some humour. One thing that stood out is the cinematography, and the dinosaurs actually act more like animals rather than monsters.

The cast was good together, with Mahersala Ali being the standout. The movie started slowly and a bit messy, but picked up as it got closer to the island, and I don't think the side family was needed, but it provided some humour. Although they probably had the best scene with T-Rex. I would have loved more scenes of the D-Rex! It felt like we only had 3 minutes of screen time, but we could have had way more with it. It's definitely terrifying. It's not a perfect film, but it's still great (much better than the last two!).",literal
"Two words: Jennifer Aniston This show is Jennifer's hands down. She is playing her career best right now and I'm loving every moment of her. She deserves all of the awards that are eventually coming her way! I can't wait to see where the rest of this show goes, I'm completely hooked with Jennifer. The male characters are very well acted, Steve Carrell, Billy Crudup is at his best and Mark Duplass is turning me into a fan. Steve Carrell's character is a little too uncomfortably on the nose to Matt Lauer. I think that part is a little weird for me still, I still slightly cringe when I see Steve Carrell's scenes and story line. I suppose that's the point? I think overall it's a good look behind the curtain of the politics and bs that goes on behind closed doors.",literal

"A great location and beautiful scenery spoiled by an unbelievable script and over-the-top acting I would like to know the real name of the Lodge where scenes from the movie were filmed. It is truly beautiful and hearkens back to 20's and 30's architecture like the Hotel Del Coronado. I know it was on either Big Bear Lake or Lake Arrowhead and would like to hear if it is still in existence. As for the movie itself, it is truly amazing that Jane Wyman was even nominated for an Academy Award. This must have been a period when she was well liked by her Academy peers. It really would have been interesting to get a true impression from Wyman and the other actors in this movie regarding the script. The script of this movie, like the recent Kevin Costner movie with a message in a bottle, is so unbelievable that it it limits the credibility that the actors can bring to their parts. Rock Hudson can be forgiven. He was never a great actor, was able to get by mostly on his looks and didn't get credible roles until later in his career (Pretty Maids is the exception). But Wyman must have been forced to take this movie through contractual requirements or the studio system.",literal

It's quite literally junk food for your brain why think so hard about it. If we wanted to think hard about these movies they wouldn't be making so many! 😂 At least this one doesn't have ""magic"" as the reason the couple gets together, at least it's a little logical!

"Action comedy done well. Alan Ritchson and Kevin James are on a playdate and it's not the kind you think of. The entire movie is an accumulation of fast paced action scenes spiked with humourous dialogues. No slow moments but constant action, and not the exaggerated kind.

"6/10 for season 3 Really didn't love this latest season. First two were highly entertaining. By the 3rd episode of the Thailand season, I was like when is something going to happen? There was no real backstory for any of the characters and the ones that were put out there were flimsy and basically uninteresting. I was so hoping that one of the 3 gal friends was gonna go into a menopausal frenzy and stab the bartender with her butter knife. Not one of the focal characters had a compelling story line. And as a native born North Carolinian, don't EVEN get me started on the horrible butchering of our lovely southern drawl. Bottom Line: Just sooooo sloowwww and not up to the shenanigans of the first 2 seasons.",literal
"A show left alive for too long. The old addage of ""die a hero or live long enough to become a villain"" applies to this show. Early season where it's finding it's footing are a little rough, with some terrible plots and character portrayals which perpetuate stigmas towards the mentally ill and disenfranchised. After it finds its groove the golden age of seasons 2 to 6 hold strong. They improve the character dynamics, introduce some strong plots and have generally good villains.

Then the decline starts, it's slow at first, propaganda here and there, terrible plot holes and some truly awful writing in some episodes but overall still a strong show. But by season 11, the cracks are undeniable. Each season, the show devolves into trope-y trash, introducing illogical plots, character assassinations, and some rehashing of story lines which were already done by this show. By the time season 13 rears it's ugly head, all fluffy snow-like goodwill the early seasons gained has melted away revealing the proverbial dog turds of episodes like ""reed's fun time in mexico"" and ""Reed the human sacrifice.""

"Time has been unkind This was THE movie that teenagers watched at parties in the late 80's. This was American Pie and Dude, Where's My Car for my generation. But, it has sadly fallen on tough times. Any 20 year old movie would show its age; the effects, the clothes and the slang are all terribly dated now, but that happens to all movies.

Where this movie got killed was in syndication. Since, it was so popular, it got shown on many of the big cable networks like TNT, USA and TBS. But, those networks also cut the movie up to fit with ""broadcast"" standards. So, not only does it look like an old movie, some of the dialog is dubbed over (badly) to remove any offensive words and some funny scenes are just cut altogether to make it more family friendly. And in so doing, the film is almost unwatchable. So, any teen watching this movie today will be left wondering what the big deal was. 

If you can see the uncut version, this is a fun film. But unless it magically appears on DVD, it will probably remain a joke that kids born after 1985 just don't get.",figurative
"Sad loss of brilliant characters I used to thoroughly enjoy this series, but with Ziva and Tony gone and Abby apparently about to leave, it has gone right down in my estimation. The three new cast members are very poor substitutes for the above, the two females (especially the dark one) being the most annoying. One feels no empathy towards them, and they seem unlikely characters to exist in an organisation such as NCIS. 

Has the USA gone to same way as the UK in being unable to produce decent TV series (or films) any longer? Guess I'll just have to stick to watching older stuff on DVD.

"Too much going on, but Solid Bones Having seen the fact that reviews of this show are critically negative, or critically positive, with very little middle ground I thought I'd make an attempt to reviewing this title.

Starting with the plot, which can be lost from the show's pacing, is that Hell is overpopulated due to how tough it is to get into Heaven, therefore creating a problem, which i solved by a once the year purging happens, where the strongest demons in hell cleanse the populous in one of the 5 points of the pentagram, and take it as their own realm. To solve this problem, we have Charlie, who is the daughter of Lucifer and the Beast Queen Lilith, who decides to open a rehabilitation center for lost souls to get back to Heaven.

With all that being said let's go into pros and cons of the show.

Pros: The show doesn't glamorize the process of forced rehabilitation, showing the souls in the Happy Hotel don't necessarily want to be rehabilitated, because the fear of death is no longer lingering over them, and they can get away with any life style, and debauchery they want. This is clearly shown by Angeldust still drinking, doing drugs, and being overall violent and sexual as an individual, with no regards to the fact he is in rehab.

Alastor's character also shows that where he wants to help with the rehabilitation process, it's less about seeing people get healthy, and more about how he wants to see people fail and repeat the cycle, to just be a sadistic individual.

Charlie is a good individual, with a kind heart, who has been shown to have problems with her parents, being that she is the opposite of what they want her to be. Living up to the expectations of the Fallen Angel who caused the great war of heaven, and the Beast Queen Lilith who is the one who raised the Behemoth, and Leviathan, who also nursed Lucifer back to health as he was slowly turned into a goat by Jehovah,charlie has some pretty big shoes to fill, especially since Lucifer is quoted in saying Charlie is a failure, and Lilith refuses to return any call, or answer the phone from her daughter. Which leads me into a minor con of the show, where the character development of Charlie seems slightly Aped from Damian's personality from Zoophobia, the comic written by Vivian.

Cons: First and foremost to get off my chest, I think the sounds mixing for character's like Alastor do need to be edited down a bit. I feel the filter used for the character fits his personality, and design fantastically, but it sounds like a 50/50 blend of the old timey filter mixed with the actor's voice, but if it was taken down to around a 40/60 filter to voice, it'd capture the same effect and clean up the characters voice enough, easy enough fix.

Another big glaring issue is I don't feel like the team was ready to release for a 2019 Halloween release, and slapped together the cleanest parts they had finished, and tried to make a cohesive story, since this was a 3 year project, that had promised a 2019 release, and didn't want to be pushed back to 2020, that said, it's a torn between damned if I do, damned if I don't situation, which do you disappoint people by continuing on with making something cleaner, and have fans pull from the wait, or do you release some content, and have fans disappointed with the pacing. I feel the second episode will be a lot cleaner and more cohesive now they got the base established.

I also feel with that said, that we have an over saturation of characters with too much going on. I understand that everyone is a hero of their own story in their own life, but establishing a minor character, like Sir Pentious in the first episode, where he wasn't really designed to be a main antagonist, did outshine the importance of Alastor's character development. With that said as well, we also have an array of characters who didn't make it in yet, who will be established as going thru rehab, and trying to get better, that the plot does seem like it will get muddied by introducing too many people too quickly.

Finally I feel like we don't learn enough about the main cast, being that I can't be the only one to miss the part where Charlie and Vaggie were a couple? I'm not asking for flat out gratuitous PDA. but the personality of Vaggie, and how she treats Charlie is that more of an assistant or best friend then a lover. There is no ""I love you"" or ""I know you can do this"" with the gentle shoulder grab showing the support, it's just inferred by Vaggie being in the hotel, and no real evidence of them actually being a couple in any form, even if we are going for the ""gay couples are just like straight couples"" portrayal, I don't buy them as dating even if they were heterosexual.

So, if you take out Sir Pentious in the pilot, and added some more one on one time with Charlie having an existential crisis about her project to rehabilitate hell, and Vaggie showing a bit more support, we would be able to get a better concept of the direction of characters, and plot.

Overall I'm genuinely curious to see where this show goes, and I do love the audio and vocal talents of the cast and crew, and have been following Vivian since this was originally the Zoophobia cartoon project, before changing over to Hazbin. I fully support this project and want to see the group grow, overall rough start, but I feel like a learning curve has been hit by the crew, that the fans who have eagerly awaited this release of the project, is being either too tightly defended by fans who want this to be good, but are criticized by the fans who expected this to be something it wasn't more harshly.

It has potential, and I'm hoping, and expecting, that the team behind the show will be able, to see where they succeeded and where they failed, and just working on moving forward with a well planned sense of how to tackle and improve the show, not just to the fandom wishes, but to the story they want to tell.

Most viewers will have mixed feelings about this first episode, so loaded with new characters with whom we have little time to understand, all edgy, and yet all surrounded by the unifying theme of how one woman deals with being told she has Stage 4 Malignant Melanoma but who decides to not inform anyone of her diagnosis, instead going after the outrageous way of living that has always been foreign to her obsessive/compulsive teacher personality. 

There are few actresses who could pull this off: Laura Linney, one of our finest actresses on the screen today, is the perfect choice for making this unbelievable character credible AND charismatic. As Cathy Jamison, she is married to a bumbling irresponsible joker Paul (Oliver Platt, again an actor in the top echelon) who is currently out of the house over some disagreement with Cathy, and is mother to naughty boy Adam (Gabriel Basso), lives across the street from a elderly curmudgeon Marlene (Phyllis Somerville) with whom Cathy finally agrees to accept and to like, is a sister to a freaky psycho brother Sean (John Benjamin Hickey), is attended by her diagnosing just-fresh-out-of-residency naive physician Dr Todd (Reid Scott), and carries on teaching a classroom with bored students, including one sassy, arrogant and overweight Andrea (Gabourey Sidibe). Life is full of surprises and they pop by so quickly that we barely can tell where the series is going. As for this viewer, though not impressed with the structure of the show, staying around for the pleasure of watching Linney and Platt will be worth it - hopefully!

"Brilliant Having been a avid viewer of ncis from the start I've thought the show was amazing the chemistry that the crew had was amazing. first Kate then ziva finally dinozzo. I thought it wouldn't work and I think I'm right bishop ,quinn, torres,just don't gel well at all McGee is McGee Abby and ducky are the only characters that still act the same as for Leroy Jethro Gibbs he has lost the edge he had turning him into a soft character just does not work Gibbs character was hard never apologies that stare but it's all going slowly but surely bring back the old Gibbs or the show will die cos the rest can't carry it .",literal
"At the end of the movie, I was still waiting for the spark... even through the end credits. The film unfolds from three different perspectives, with Bigelow experimenting with multiple angles, offering a complex and tense vision of the events. However, as each perspective unfolds, a sense of déjà vu begins to appear, and interest can wane slightly. At times, the repetition of tense moments makes the small details stand out more.

The first act is exceptionally well-crafted - it grabs you, builds tension perfectly, and makes you believe something truly extraordinary is about to happen. Bigelow creates a pressing atmosphere from the very first minutes, with carefully framed shots and a rhythm that keeps you engaged.

But by the second act, everything begins to unravel. The film becomes harder to follow, the initial tension fades, and the experimentation with perspectives and angles starts to feel more tiring than engaging. Overall, it comes across as an experimental film that fails to maintain its initial promise.

Zero Dark Thirty was about the past. The Hurt Locker wasn't about the Iraq War; it was about the protagonist's personal drama. This film, on the other hand, resonates through tension and fear, showing how people live with uncertainty and danger in the present.

It's not just a story about war or the threat of nuclear disaster, but about the emotions and decisions of people under extreme pressure.

PS: Don't rush to criticize it as a total failure - the director's intention and the concept itself are not bad at all. The only problem is that the next two perspectives don't reach the level of the first. Had they managed that, it could have been a 10/10 film.",literal
"chemistry in a cynical world Some years after writing for ""The X Files"", Vince Gilligan created a show. I only saw scattered episodes of ""Breaking Bad"" during its run, but I finally got around to binge-watching the first season. Bryan Cranston puts on one of the most chilling performances in TV history as a terminally ill teacher who turns to manufacturing crystallized methamphetamine to support his family. Basically, the show is about moral ambiguity and how actions have consequences. Indeed, each episode adds a new complication.

When I first read about the show during its run, I saw a picture of Bryan Cranston with a beard, glasses, and a shaved head. Having known him as the dad on ""Malcolm in the Middle"", he looked unrecognizable in that photo. But he's proved himself to be a truly versatile actor in the past few years, with roles in ""Contagion"", ""Argo"", ""Godzilla"", and ""All the Way"" (as Lyndon Johnson).

In the meantime, this show will offer some of the most unusual chemistry lessons. Outstanding show. It deserved every award that it won.

I wonder if Vince Gilligan has ever gotten comments about ""Gilligan's Island"".",literal
"2020 was a weird year... Rating: 7.5/10 Watched on Wednesday, July 23, 2025 (first watch) Format: regular theatre

I enjoyed how the story unfolds towards the end and specifically the last hour. It gave it a meaning which what I was worried about halfway through the film as I felt like the story and characters weren't progressing.

The sound mixing/editing is the most powerful element in the film in my opinion. It was loud in moments where it needed to be loud which enhances the viewer's experience into what's being shown on screen and vice versa.

Joaquin phoenix does an awesome acting role as usual. Can't say the same for Emma Stone's due to her character's (Louise Cross) weak storyline that deserved more attention. Same goes for Austin Butler's Vernon.

Cinematography has its moments but not the best compared to the directors other projects. Same with the directing, not Ari's best work but you can tell there is a lot of foreshadowings and easter eggs that would give the directing more meaning to be appreciated. I got to add by saying that the comedy aspect wasn't forced, when it suppose to make you laugh, you will indeed laugh out loud. A funny and engaging film that leaves room for a slow boredom towards the middle.",literal
"Watch Kenneth Branagh's Frankenstein instead Having read the book and seen Branagh's most faithful adaptation ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"" (1994), I certainly had high hopes. Del Toro is one of my favourite directors but unfortunately his Frankenstein lacks the intrigue, thrill and wonder compared to his earlier films. Actually, this movie is so overrated with all the high scores which I'm suspecting are from the Elodie fans and people who haven't read the book or watched Branagh's far superior movie.

20 minutes in and there's little chemistry between the characters, the story is slow and it just feels like a lot of effort put into visual and not substance. The storyline goes off into its own tangent like the soundtrack which is completely wrong. The scene where Victor (Isaac) is slicing corpses, there's a waltz playing - as if to say it's just like tiptoeing through the tulips to Dr Frankenstein. There's a total lack of a serious, sombre and ominous mood. The whole movie just feels like child's play, target audience is probably late teens to 20ish viewers.

It's almost near the hour that Dr F finally brings the Creature (Elodie) to life. But not before an insane additional scene put in purely for gore when Harlander (Waltz) insists to be part of the Creature despite he's infected with syphillis. He and Victor fights and Harlander falls to his gruesome death.

The movie goes off Shelley's book a lot for no good reason whatsoever, it's quite disrespectful. It shouldn't even be called Frankenstein for shredding and throwing out so many important details. The most annoying is Elizabeth (Goth) having a lot of beef and clashes with Victor when in the book, she's in love with him and calms him down because of her kind nature. In the movie, she also starts bonding with the Creature and Goth almost looks like she's swooning and turning into another Elodie fan.

This movie is disappointing on so many levels and I'll bet when the hype dies down, the current 7.8/10 rating will go down too. Sad to say it doesn't do Shelley's legendary story justice and even sadder that Del Toro felt he had to change pivotal plotlines. It's absolutely gut wrenching when someone messes with an iconic book.

Hollywood should stop rehashing so many movies that don't need new version. Just leave classics, books and movies, alone. Go create something original like Mary Shelley did.",literal
"Painful Ignoring Kim's blank face acting, the writing is so unfunny and unserious. This show is pure fantasy that is not clever enough to keep actual intelligent women engaged. I'm sad that Naomi, Niecy, Sarah, and Glenn signed on for this after such illustrious careers. Netflix really threw monopoly money bags at Ryan Murphy to crank out trash with big names.",literal
"Wow Love it. Incredible casting, directing, writing. Recommending this to everyone I know. Very cinematic. Patricia Arquette steals every scene. She's just a gem. Great character actors throughout.

Now personally, if my last name was Murdaugh, I would not commit murders. But that's just me. Probably not a good idea to do the other crimes either.",figurative
"switch your brain off I watched this after the cure for all poorly critically received films, 6 glasses of malbec. Laughed many times and thoroughly enjoyed it, no one cares what critics care about anymore, it isnt going to win an Oscar but its a good 90 minute distraction from the grim reality of the world outside. Switch your brain off, have a couple of peeves and get yourself a bowl of popcorn and chill out for a little bit.",literal
"Demented fun National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation is just as demented as the other Vacation flicks, which in general are pretty weird to begin with. Stemming from Chevy Chase's off kilter personality, into the antics of the rest of the cast, it's a jumble of jokes that don't always land and are somewhat trapped in an 80's humour bubble, but are also frequently hilarious. Chase plays awkward Clark Griswold, overseeing a chaotic holiday celebration at his home with his wife (Beverly D'Angelo) and kids, including a very young Juliette Lewis, as well as his extended clan, headed up by obnoxious, boorish brother Randy Quaid who assists him in his struggles with his selfish boss. It all flies by in a flurry of silliness, with memorable appearances from Sam Mcmurray, Diane Ladd, E.G. Marshall, Doris Roberts, William Hickey and more. Always a weird and wonderful holiday treat.",literal
"Split decision Some of this show is pretty good I think. Like the plot, Gibbs is such a loved yet tough character, it has such potential to reveal him. BUT no one can explain why the chose the actor who does not resemble him in the least. Kudos to the actor for getting Gibbs demeanor, expression and voice inflections, but it makes no difference unfortunately. I love Franks actor and character , it really is his show. Can't go backwards and replace the Gibbs actor now, so let's just hope the story can make up for that error. The rest of the cast is sufficient, the young woman seems irrelevant but we will see.",literal
"Predator: Badlands - Redefining Mediocrity Life really is a matter of perspective. Your boyfriend isn't a useless, effeminate wreck that makes your skin crawl; he's just redefining masculinity. And I'm not drunk right now; I'm redefining sobriety.

By that same logic, Predator: Badlands isn't actually a goofy buddy comedy with cute animal sidekicks, a protagonist with daddy issues, weightless CGI battles, and wacky android banter that feels like a rejected Mandalorian episode. It is redefining what a Predator movie should be.

The Setup I wasn't exactly excited to see this film. The idea of a Predator movie told from the Predator's point of view already felt like a betrayal of what makes the creatures compelling, their mystery. The trailers didn't help either: ugly Predator redesigns, excessive CGI, and critics like Grace Randolph praising its ""humanization"" and hinting at a romance with an android. That's when I knew civilization was done for.

Still, social media couldn't stop gushing about it as if it were the second coming of 1987. Rotten Tomatoes even claims it's better. Sure. Whatever you say, corporate shills.

The Story The movie opens on the Predator homeworld, or maybe generic alien planet number one. They look identical anyway. Here we meet our hero, Deck, also known as Lumpy, who is about to go on his first hunt. His toxically masculine father decides he is too weak and orders his brother to kill him instead. One messy family argument later, Lumpy crash lands on generic alien planet number two, a death world where everything wants to kill you. Think Australia, but friendlier.

There he meets Quirky Android Lady, a Weyland-Yutani explorer who somehow speaks fluent Predator. Do not ask how; the film doesn't care. They team up: she will help him hunt the planet's apex creature, the Callisk, if he helps her get repaired and rescued. They are joined by a cute alien sidekick named Bud, because of course they are.

Wacky hijinks, emotional bonding, and endless babbling follow. Can they defeat the monster? Will Lumpy face his toxic father? Who cares?

The Good To be fair, if you forget this is supposed to be a Predator movie, it's fine. The visuals are decent. The pacing is serviceable. There is some adventure flair and even a clear emotional arc. It works as a lighthearted sci-fi film for younger audiences.

The Bad But it's not a lighthearted sci-fi film. It is a Predator movie, and it completely misunderstands what that means. The tone, style, and intent are so far removed from the original that it feels like slamming an F1 car into reverse at full speed. This is not evolution; it's regression.

Quippy humor, cutesy mascots, and family melodrama do not belong anywhere near this franchise. Even Prey, which I wasn't crazy about, at least respected the material. Badlands turns every fight, death, and plot point into a joke.

And then there is Quirky Android Lady, a walking migraine in human form. Every time she opens her mouth, it's like someone dragging a fork across your brain. Imagine programming a top-tier exploration synth to behave like a hyperactive TikToker. Brilliant.

The Ugly Lumpy's design looks worse than the 1987 creature, even with a massive modern budget. That is not innovation; that is creative bankruptcy.

Ultimately, Predator: Badlands feels like Disney's sanitized version of horror: an emotionally vulnerable hero, daddy issues, an animal mascot, a sequel-bait ending, and zero edge. The franchise has gone from primal and terrifying to safe and marketable.

Verdict Predator: Badlands isn't a bad movie. It's a bad Predator movie. It's the cinematic equivalent of declawing a tiger and wondering why it stopped hunting.

Save your money. Catch it on streaming. And maybe rewatch the original to remember what real Predator storytelling looked like.

Rating: 4/10 - Redefining disappointment.",literal
"Whole lot of smoulderin' going on..... Starting off smouldering as a redcoat in the American War of Independence where he ""volunteered"" to avoid being hanged back home in Cornwall,Ross Poldark (Mr A.Turner) continues much in the same vein on his return to find his inheritance gone and his fiancée appropriated by his rather wet cousin. He is man apart from his Cornish pals due to him having gone to a posh school and everything and feels like a square peg in a round hole living in a run - down bothy with two recalcitrant servants. On a visit to town to sell his watch he saves a young girl from a beating and takes her to a tavern where she exhibits shockingly bad manners;despite this he offers her a place at his pigsty,where,in short order she turns out to be a damned attractive young lady. She is called Demelza and is played with relish by Miss E.Tomlinson. Her Pa and her brothers come to take her back but are beaten off by Ross and his homies,this gives Mr Turner further opportunities to smoulder with a bloody nose to boot. His former fiancée realises she has made a terrible mistake,but she's obviously mistaken him for someone who gives a toss and he rides off with Demelza into episode two. I really enjoyed this new ""Poldark"" because it does post - modern irony which of course hadn't been invented forty years ago when it had it's first incarnation. It is a deliberate exercise in myth - building with Poldark himself set to be the next Mr Darcy. There are dog - fights,cock - fights and bloke - fights enough for anybody and Mr Turner cuts a suitable dash to ensure the next few Sunday nights will be accompanied by a couple of cans of lager and some Pringles. So it's off the blocks and running,then,for the Beeb's next Big One. Forget the politically - motivated ""Banished"" and watch this for the sheer fun of it.",literal
"A good break from reality.. Realistic? Maybe not, but Scott Wolf is awesome in it and the rest of the cast is great. A great show to enjoy if you liked past hospital shows. I love it. Some are complaining that it is unrealistic but there is so much graphic shows now, do we really need more? I find this show pleasant and interesting. My kids like it too. I loved Magnum PI and I believe that Barbie Kligman also wrote for that show as well, so if you liked the flow and feeling of that show you will like this one also. She is an awesome writer, I believe she also worked on Designated Survivor and the Law and Order series Special Victims. Just check it out!!",literal
"Missed opportunity I was excited to see a show about the hassles of the DMV, but this clearly did not deliver. The writing was juvenile, at best. I guess this is what we get now with most of society laughing at short internet clips of people hurting themselves. SMH. Sad. Especially with Tim Meadows, who is hilarious, usually. Is he on the writing team? Can he bring in his buddy Tina Fey? Someone please rescue this show! Any writers from The Office available?",literal
"How far will you go for a chance of winning? The Long Walk is another Stephen King adaptation, and it is actually good, based on his first novella with the same name. The performances are great with Cooper Hoffman and David Jonsson, who were in last year's Alien: Romulus, give a standout performance as Peter and Ray, and the supporting cast is pretty good as well, especially Judy Greer as Ray's mother who gives a heartbreaking performance as this depsrate mother who lost her husband and dont want her son to end up with the same fate and Mark Hamill is fine as well. The coloring on this film is grey and muddy, which is undesirable in a movie like Wicked because that movie is supposed to be colorful and not appear as if the saturation has been reduced. However, in this case, it works because the setting is supposed to be cold and cloudy.

I also think it was good to hire Francis Lawrence, who directed the Hunger Games movie, to direct this because he brings that unforgiving and bleak dystopian tone that this movie needs to have, and unlike Hunger Games, which is spectacle and pristine white, Long Walk is more realistic and more brutal, thanks to the R rating. The character development is also nice, with these characters actually feeling like people who had lives before this grueling tournament, which makes it hit even harder when they die because it feels like we watch a human being who had a life die and not a numbered body bag.

Now this movie isn't perfect, and I do have some negative thoughts as well. One of the things that really bothers me is that the movie is shallow in its messaging, with The Long Walk being a metaphor for war and more specifically, the Vietnam War, because that was when King was writing the story at the time, and that message is so on the nose at some points it becomes noticeable like how Ray's mom hugs him before saying goodbye mirroring how parents say goodbye to their kids before being drafted or the use of millitary imagery and the tanks shooting people slow down or resist the war or in this case challenge, The pacing is also slow at times with character just dying so they can get rid of the extras on set or just so they can get us a bit of world building that doesn't really pay off in the end.

So The Long Walk is a good Stephen King adaptation in a pile of silly and trash remakes and reboots of his other works, with great performances, solid writing, and great tension that will leave you on the edge of your seat as the film goes on. The Long Walk is just another solid horror movie released in 2025 in a year full of future classics.",literal
"Love this show!! Th characters in this show seem very realistic, excellent acting!! Good job!!!",literal
"Great Animation, Weird Music Choices This was an opportunity to showcase different types of music and voices, but every song sounded like it was taken straight from Broadway, or even more accurately, a Disney movie. It wasn't just the style of music, the lyrics clashed with the script, too. The lead actress had an extremely conventional voice - not the smokey low tones you'd expect from the Princess of Hell. The music clashed so much with the show that I was tempted to just skip over it. If you enjoy adult animation and Disney/Broadway, this might be a hit for you. I loved that there was an LGBT couple without any reference to them being LGBT, it just was. I also appreciated the cast's voice acting skills, there were a variety of theatrical accents to be impressed by. Even though I probably won't be putting it on my re-watch list, if a second season comes out I would definitely watch it.",literal
"Outspoken and funny series that proves life is short, have fun and make the most out of it with what you have left! This new series ""The Big C"" is very relative and really touching as thru most of everyone's life they have known someone who has lived with cancer or died from it. However in most cases the affected just drag along and stay depressed and live down in the dumps, however this series shows a different side of the life it proves when affected one can live life to the fullest! It centers around Cathy Jamison(played wonderful by Laura Linney) who as a divorced single mother living in suburban Minneapolis makes a buck by teaching high school receives horrible news. Cathy has just been diagnosed with stage 4 melanoma, and up until that point Cathy has always lived life uptight now it's time to let her spirits fly open with fun! Because already she's got problems galore first she's just recently divorced from her ex husband Paul(Oliver Platt)and it's her goal to get him into a session of couples therapy! And it's going to be a big job seeing her son Adam(Gabriel Basso)who's a slacker finish his high school days. Cathy's also motivated to help an overweight student Andrea(Gabourey Sidibe) lose weight and feel good about herself plus Cathy has a homeless brother she has to help and she also contends with an old boss and rude next door neighbor.

Still Cathy sees thru all the drama and problems as she seeks out pleasures and joys of life doing small simple things that make her happy. And too she goes after some big things like buying material things, exploring new love I guess you must when you don't have long to live. She's really lightened up and became a fun free spirited seeker. Overall this is not a series of tragedy to much drama mixed with fun laughs is provided yet it's message is clear live life to the fullest because it's short you never know when a deadly disease like the big c can strike to shorten it.",literal
"Another hit from Sheridan! Taylor pumps out hit after hit, and this show is great too, with one minor exception, the character Tyson, played by Jay Will is rather annoying, and sticks out like a sore thumb amongst this cast. His character doesn't fit into this show whatsoever. He's here for one reason, and one reason only, to check a box. There should be no hip hop in this show, it's about the mob, and mobsters, not Suge knight and rappers!

A true mobster would never hand pick this guy to drive him around, and be his right hand man.

Other than that, I like Sly, and the rest of the cast, so I'll keep watching.

Get mad if you want, just my opinion.",literal
"Billybob yes for new series,It's a good idea for a show.The Show has enough action init to keep your attention. I liked the scenes,with Billybob Thornton except, the ones ,with his daughter. She ,over acted and there's one scene where her boyfriend is told to sleep alone on the couch. She,is supposed to sleep in her father's bed. She ,doesn't wear pajamas and gets in bed with him wearing underwear. It is so gross ! The next day it's all about her wearing a g string bikini. It's so over the top ,She wear Crisco oil for her suntan ,what a surprise She ,can't find her suntan oil. I ,always like billybob and will continue watching this series. I ,hope his daughter finds some clothes to put on first though. The series, starts out a little vague but once ,you get past the first episode you find a little interest in the characters.i find that it's a down on his luck oil man struggling day by day to make end meet . Also the son needs directions and take some initiative for the things that happened in the first episode.

But the daughter treats her father as a pimp and is very immature. The Also have a over abundance of dropping the F bombs.there is also a ex wife who is very self absorbed. And wants control but has no control over herself much less help with her troubled children that are well into there 20s.

If changes are made this could be a decent series.",figurative
"-LE PACTE DES LOUPS- One of the Most ORIGINAL Movies in Modern Cinema. ----LE PACTE DES LOUPS--- or

-- --The Brotherhood of the Wolf--- or -------El Pacto de los Lobos---- ---title in French, English and Spanish, respectively)

....IS (IMO) ONE OF THE MOST ORIGINAL MOVIES IN MODERN CINEMA!!!!!!!

LE PACTE DES LOUPS is a very entertaining movie at the beginning and a film that invites a lot to reflection and afterthought in its middle and final parts. It also has very nice scenarios, both natural and man-made. It keeps us most of the time wondering about the outcome of the three parts that (IMO) constitute the central plot: the story of the characters, the story of the hunting of ""The Beast of Gévaudan"" and the history of La France and Europe as a whole during those years, corrupt monarchies and controlling church included.

Scenography is very good and really makes us dream about the ""époque"" the film talks about, with all its good and bad (and sometimes very very bad) things. We also had some very decent scenes of action and an overall feeling of being experiencing things very close to they way they should have been in France during the seventeen hundred and something. An eclectic mix of drama, terror, eroticism, martial arts and both historical and detective novels that I found completely enjoyable, thrilling and satisfying!!!!!!!

One of the most interesting things, I guess, is reading in the IMBb Trivia Facts about the real existence of a ""Beast of Gévaudan"" during the XVIII Century, same as most of the main characters depicted by the movie, even when we know that a lot of it'd have been novelized, knowing that virtually all the elements in the movie have at least some historical background is impressive, to say the least.

Thanks for reading

IMDb Review written by David del Real. México City. México. November 2017.",literal
"Surprisingly good I hate the posters for Roofman. They don't represent the movie and make it look cornier than it is. The plain yellow background with characters pasted on it looks so tacky, or I might just be annoyed that it reminded me Dumb Money existed, which was one of the most aggressively nothing films of the decade so far.

Roofman is sometimes funny and it has a high-concept premise, so I get wanting to emphasize it's fun. Lots of it is fun, even when it's not trying to be funny. But I was also surprised by how tense a lot of it is. It's got a guy who's smart but also an idiot doing a combination of smart and idiotic things, and it gave me the kind of feeling I remember having while watching the first season or so of Breaking Bad, before it got intense in a depressing way. It's also fun in the way Dawn of the Dead is fun, with the setting and survival aspect of it, but minus the zombies.

I don't know what poster would represent it more fittingly. It is a tonally bizarre movie, but that's what made me like it so much, and feel willing to overlook some of the flaws. Like, the dialogue is really on the nose at certain points, and there's some tension between the sentimental stuff and how realistic it's trying to be at other points, but maybe that tension is interesting. As for the clunky dialogue, they give a lot of the worst lines to LaKeith Stanfield, and he's a strong enough actor to sell most of them.

Channing Tatum's the best part of the movie, though. I don't think it'll be up the Oscar's alley, but it's nice to be reminded he has range. This would make a good double feature with Logan Lucky, which is a film I keep meaning to revisit, though I keep forgetting it exists, but not as often as I forget Dumb Money exists. Agh, curse you, Dumb Money.",literal
Love this! Disney plus for the Win I 100% recommended. Yes its only 3 episodes in but its so good and I'm so happy to see Selena Gomez in acting. Its a Disney plus original everywhere and HUlU in US so watch it.,literal
"Criminally Under-rated This serious is easily 8+. With all of the incredible garbage out there (cough, Witcher s4) it's so refreshing to watch a realistic, well-acted, exciting, gripping and engaging series like this. It ties in the history of the times with epic storytelling and even includes palace intrigue and romance.

The main actor, Rob, does a masterful job balancing his humanity with his ever increasing rage. The action sequences are extremely well shot and the love story with Marian is an engaging side story to Rob's growing war with the sheriff.

A lot going on in this extremely well done series and I'm fascinated to see where they take it. It's on par with Braveheart.

Don't listen to the bad reviews. You will enjoy this one.",literal
Excellent I love it when a movie comes along on a real life historical event that I'm sketchy about the details. Nuremberg is such a movie. I knew of the trials at the end of the second world war but was ignorant of what occurred among the allies to get to that point. There were great performances all round so I won't single anyone out. It took to the end of the movie for me to appreciate that many of the main characters did exist and the closing details on screen did add even more poignancy to the story. Being reminded visually of the evil that men can do was a very hard watch at times. Definitely the best movie I've seen this weekend.,literal
"Between Swords, Wolves, and Conspiracies An action epic? A mystery film? A political drama? A period romance? Brotherhood of the Wolf (2001) answers with a resounding ""yes"" to all of these questions. And it even adds kung fu, an invincible Native American warrior, and a courtesan spy, because why not? While some might turn up their noses at its anachronistic approach and insistence on firing in all directions, the truth is that the film does so with undeniable style. The result is a visual and narrative spectacle that, even while stumbling over its ambitions, delivers an experience as extravagant as it is fascinating.

The plot unfolds in 18th-century France, where a monstrous creature terrorizes the Gévaudan region, killing women and children without anyone managing to capture it. To solve the problem, the king sends Grégoire de Fronsac (Samuel Le Bihan), a naturalist who never misses a chance to showcase his talents. Alongside him is Mani (Mark Dacascos), a stoic Iroquois warrior whose quiet demeanor is compensated by his powerful presence and lethal moves. As they investigate, the two discover that the beast may be the least of their problems, as behind the attacks lies a conspiracy with deeper roots than expected.

If the story weren't already a whirlwind of influences, Christophe Gans' direction makes sure to amplify that feeling. The film has the energy of a modern blockbuster, with action scenes worthy of a samurai film, well-choreographed sequences, and a generous-sometimes excessive-use of slow motion. Some sequences feel straight out of Jaws, like the tense attempt to capture the beast, while others evoke tales of aristocratic conspiracy, reminiscent of The Count of Monte Cristo. There are even creative visual transitions that add extra charm, such as the image of a naked woman's body transforming into a snowy landscape. It's a film that isn't afraid to experiment.

But while Brotherhood of the Wolf succeeds in creating a stylish and immersive universe, it falters in developing its political conspiracy. The idea of an aristocratic cult using the beast as an instrument of social control is brilliant, but poorly explored. The film mentions that the king is being indulgent with philosophers and that the church's influence is at risk, but it never shows us concrete signs of this decay. There are no scenes of empty churches, priests worried about losing followers, or nobles desperate to hold onto their positions. The conspiracy is exposed, but its motivations remain vague, which diminishes the impact of the revelation. The main villain, Jean-François (Vincent Cassel), suffers from the same issue: he has a strong presence, a mysterious past, and a disabled arm, but his motivation boils down to frustration and an incestuous obsession with his sister. A threatening figure? Yes. A well-developed antagonist? Not so much.

In the end, Brotherhood of the Wolf stands on the strength of its inspired direction, its charismatic lead, and especially Mani, whose silent presence and lethal skill make him one of the film's standout characters. The film may not tie all of its ideas together perfectly, but it compensates with a unique visual identity, memorable action scenes, and an irresistible charm. It aims in all directions and, even if it misses some targets, still manages to hit the jugular.",literal
"Quite enjoyable, but could have been better I watched it with my girlfriend and we both used to be big kpop fans.

The first half (and more, probably 80% of the movie) is pretty unbearable and tiresome since every character acts like they've drank 500 red bulls and we both felt like this film is heavily targeted towards very young children with extremely low attention spans. It was honestly very irritating how noone could chill for a minute and talk like an actual human being. It's a shame cause the scenes when it's more of a normal movie are really good and one of it's redeemable qualities apart from some good songs, good animation and a very strong final act where the movie finally decides to piece something good together.

We also felt like Huntrix was a bit more K/DA than an actual kpop group, but that's honestly just too minor and not necessarily a negative, just an observation.

Overall quite enjoyable, but I felt like it could have been a lot better if it was just...a lot more chill.",literal
"Man of Steel Had More Punch This movie's just alright-not terrible, but nothing special either. It sticks to the same old superhero playbook: flashy action scenes, predictable villain, and barely any emotional depth. I kept hoping for something fresh, maybe a twist or standout moment, but it never really delivered. Man of Steel packed more emotional punch and felt way more intense by comparison. Watching this was like flipping through an 80s TV series rerun-nostalgic, kind of charming-but now wrapped in shiny modern CGI. It looks cool, sure, but beneath the surface, it's all pretty hollow. Fun for the visuals, maybe, but the story? Already forgotten.",literal
"The daughter and wife Periodically fuming watching this!

What is the point of the characters of the daughter and mother? Easily one of the most annoying and insufferable characters I have had the misfortune to see on television.

This show had the potential to really be an amazing piece of television drama but the scenes involving the mother and daughter are such an unwelcome distraction one would be well advised to skip through them. For the life of me, I cannot see what value they bring to this plot.

Michael Peña's character was a great loss but I'm still soldering through the episodes because of Billy Bob Thornton.",literal
"Sleep inducing! Calling this show slow would be a compliment. It is plodding, disjointed with talented actors forced to deliver inane dialog. There is absolutely no chemistry between the two main characters, making it impossible to actually care about them. I made it halfway through the third episode before I realized that action sequences could not erase the fact that I was almost a third of the way through the series and I still couldn't figure out what direction they were going in much less was interested in finding out. Probably could have been an entertaining movie. Ten hours? No way!",literal
"Top tier acting Would not have missed this one. Rhys was so good here. Danes, as well, but some of her skills felt repetitive. Feel she is always seeking honesty so expect her expressions were real, but still would have respected a little less 'my lips are quivering' anxiety. She is a striking, sexy woman in person and I admire her lack of vanity on the screen. The supporting actors were so excellent, the FBI couple. Wish the writer could have let one or two people live. Loved the ending.",literal
"My favorite firefighter series There's tons of cop, lawyer and doctor shows on TV and firefighters are way too under represented in TV series. Actually Chicago Fire and Rescue Me are the only full blown fireman shows that I even know it. Rescue Me was a good show but had too much Gavin family drama in sometimes. And while Chicago Fire may show a little bit of there off duty lives, most of the time the show deals with their on duty lives.

The best part of CF is deals both the Truck and Squad companies in addition to an EMS team. The actors on the show really play the part well too, you could tell they went on plenty of ride alongs and investigated the roles to prepare themselves for the roles appropriately.",literal
"A real life drama This was one series I could not stop watching. After just retiring after thirty years as a hospital employee, I had all the time in the world to click from one episode to the next. It's not unthinkable that a person with Jackie's addiction could be working in an ER. Pharmacy techs, I would say, would be the most tempted to use.

One of my lost friends was fired because of his addiction to whatever he felt he needed at the time, as he swung from self-prescribed pain to psych meds, and provided them to a couple of his friends who suffered with RA and fibromyalgia. To those sufferers, he was a true life saver, a Robin Hood. But, even for him, his work had to end, which it did, in a mindset that left him madly searching for a new direction.

The numbers of individuals today who suffer with real pain from car accidents, fibro, RA, spinal conditions and more is very high. Without a doubt, there was once many ""pill mills"" in this country designed to dish out any amount to whoever would pay. One man, I was told, raised a fortune by dealing with numerous pain managers who wrote out scripts for him for the most very sought-after drugs by street users. He left a bundle of money to his children when he passed away from old age. Sadly, his son today, in his thirties, cannot function well because he struggles terribly with alcoholism. A part time job as a fast food worker earns him enough to purchase cigarettes and beer while he lives on the patio of a friend.

""Nurse Jackie"" did an excellent job in portraying real life with a not a too-difficult-to believe set of dilemmas inserted. The lies, the relationship issues, the jumping from one set of rules to another, the complete inconsistency of one's life, are real conditions of addicts' lives. 

How well hidden some folks are able to lie their way through life with acquaintances, friends, family members, coworkers, and rehab employees. Like the young boy with green hair, they know their life is owned by one substance or another. That is what life is about for them, just another mind alteration ahead. As a musician, I've seen these traits in action among fellow artists.

This series is a wake-up call to the nation, but should not be used to foster the complete blocking of much needed pain meds for the truly ill, like those with cancer and nerve conditions that bring along with them pain and, all too often, a desire to commit suicide.

It is those with real pain who need help, whether they fall into a kind of addiction or not. They need relief. That's what's wrong with this country today. In an effort to rid it of the abusers, it's killing the actual victims ""living"" with the most profound levels of pain. Let's allow them to live a life the best they know how, even though they sway from, in the least, bouts of constipation and the lack of concentration. 

Life is too precious to allow for the depths of agony pain sufferers today feel. Let's be compassionate. Let us pass medical marijuana laws and allow the use of medicine to provide relief for the victims of pain.",literal
"A disappointing start to the new DC Universe. Let me say this up front: I'm not a fan of Superman as a superhero, but I do enjoy James Gunn's work (especially his «GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY» trilogy, which I absolutely love), so I was genuinely curious and looking forward to his new film about the Man of Steel.

Unfortunately, this time James Gunn left me disappointed. The biggest issue is the script. For some reason, the director chose to throw the audience straight into the middle of the action, with almost no background or introduction for the main character. Some might argue that Superman's origin story is no longer necessary, but in my view, it's absolutely essential for a full-fledged reboot. This is David Corenswet's first appearance as Clark Kent, and the film clearly lacks at least 30 minutes of emotional buildup to help us connect with him. Without that foundation, it's hard to truly care about his character.

The same goes for the rest of the cast. Lex Luthor lacks a clear motivation: he wants to destroy Superman right from the start, but there's no deeper reasoning behind it. Clark's relationship with his adoptive parents is barely shown - they appear only in a few short scenes. His connection with Lois Lane also feels shallow. There's no real chemistry between them, and their relationship seems to develop entirely off-screen. As a result, it feels more like we're watching the second installment in a franchise rather than the first.

Another serious flaw is the overload of secondary heroes. The audience is thrown into a new world packed with characters: Green Lantern, Mister Terrific, Hawkgirl, Metamorpho, The Engineer, Ultraman - all of whom show up, but almost none receive meaningful screen time (Mister Terrific is arguably the most developed). They're hard to remember, let alone care about. For the average viewer unfamiliar with the DC Universe, it's genuinely overwhelming. «BATMAN V SUPERMAN» was heavily criticized for a similarly chaotic structure, yet despite sharing the same flaws, Gunn's latest film is somehow receiving mostly positive reviews. I just don't get it.

So, for the first film in the rebooted DC Universe (DCU), I expected a more coherent, emotionally rich, and self-contained story. For many viewers - especially newcomers - this movie might feel chaotic and overcrowded. And, in essence, that's exactly how it is. In just two hours of runtime, Gunn packed in so much that it could have easily been stretched out into an entire season of a TV series.

6/10

P. S. I'm not a Zack Snyder fan, even though I'm aware of his massive fanbase. Personally, I see him as a strong visionary but a weak writer and director. Still, I have to be honest: his «MAN OF STEEL» left a far deeper impression on me than James Gunn's new «SUPERMAN». As disappointing as that is - especially given how much I admire Gunn's previous work - I have to speak frankly about how I feel.",literal
"An Uneven Series That Found Its Footing *Read season finale update below *

Being unfamiliar with most of Kaitlin Olson's work I watched this feeling it would pass some time, while having low expectations.

Surprise on me.

Olson is definitely the star and the centerpiece. If she doesn't nail her performance the series has no chance. She's excellent. Unfortunately it's not sustained. The plot device getting her hired isn't revisited in episodes 4 or 5. The other actors do NOT hold up their end. But the writing is what ultimately derails this show. Bad writing. Real bad. Incredibly bad. The babbling nonsensical solutions to the last two cases was terrible.

The concept, gifted and damaged individual possessing a knack for solving crimes, has been done before. And the series reminded me of Natasha Lyonne's similar series (Poker Face). There is also a bit of a similarity to ""Elsbeth"", a series about an attorney on the spectrum who solves murders. Both series lean heavily on the female leads, and inject character driven humor.

This is an ensemble show, like Elsbeth, with support from Daniel Sunjata and Javica Leslie and Judy Reyes, whereas Poker Face is about a nomadic gifted individual on the run.

The first two episodes were enjoyable.

Then came the next two episodes.

As often happens with a first year in a series, episode 3 is a clunker. Olson comes off as shrill and unnecessarily disrespectful. Sunjata vacillated between beginning to like Olson and being completely unimpressed. There are other disjointed character issues in that episode, and a very convoluted plot.

The hope that this was a one off and just a matter of the writers, actors and directors settling in with a new series was blown up by the cringe-worthy bad fourth episode.

I may check back at the end of the season to see if the writing improves, but for now, I'm on to other things.

*season finale update* So, this series only received a 13 episode order because it was a Fall release series.

The season ended in a major, multi-layered cliff hanger. Can't get upset about that because many series do that, especially over on the streaming networks.

In episode 13 Morgan (Olson) is given more latitude by her PD colleagues, but still wearing clothes that look like she's working in Vice as a hooker. Her family life is still conveniently held together by her ex who babysits on the fly, sometimes for days apparently. Does he not have a job?

The cranky, obnoxious teen girl has calmed down a lot, and seems more supportive of her single mom.

We discover(?) that her partner (Sunjata) is gay. Why the late desire to skew this character in this direction? Feels weird.

Her other bullpen teammates feel more self-assured.

Her work boss seems unchanged from the earlier episodes, and an early love interest comes back into her life, and an odd character who seems to know what happened to her husband figures largely in this episode.

The mystery, almost murder, is better than the capers in episodes 3 & 4, but feels very much like a three part story I remember from The Mentalist.

Nevertheless, definitely smoother (if not more sophisticated) than the early bad episodes. I'll tune in for season two.",literal

"I am angry. As a loyal fan of the original series The Office from the BBC, I was appalled at the thought that millions of Americans will experience this story in such an adulterated form. I finished watching the first episode about 5 minutes ago, which had the same plot and script as the first episode of its British counterpart. For one thing, Jim's character (Tim in the original) was totally mis-cast. He's too handsome and confident to play the shy but lovable loser portrayed by Martin Freeman in England. Second of all, and more importantly, the acting (while quite funny) was still very clearly acting. In the original show, Ricky Gervais led a cast that delighted us by acting perfectly. We were 100% drawn into the plot and characters. Gervais drove us into hysterics with his portrayal of David Brent. Please, before it's too late, rent season one of the original office and watch it and see what i mean. The original show was brilliant, and this is totally mediocre. I am not a snobby person who likes British TV better because it's British. The Office is the only British show I watch...it only aired for two seasons, and including the Christmas special ending only runs eight hours. Rent it now, please.",literal
"The only good Nazi ... ... is a dead Nazi.

Sisu comes from the super-hero sub-genre of films, but The Immortal doesn't have a skin tight superhereo suit nor cape, but a lot of smarts, an ability to tolerate pain, and a lot of will.

I knew a kid in preschool who took a lot of chances in life as a youngster. Blonde haired, alpha-male like, got injured quite a bit, but wanted the attention, and didn't seem to care whom he hurt. He reminds me of the Nazi company commander in this film, who thinks he's playing it safe, has a lot of confidence, but in actuality is in over his head.

A Finnish gold miner strikes it rich, and fights for his prize against, at best, a platoon of Nazi soldiers in a truck, with a few more in another truck guarding some women prisoners followed by a Soviet tank dressed up to look like a Nazi Panzer for the sake of the film.

The film is largely over the top. I was curious if it was the retelling of a famous Nordic sniper, which may have been the intent, but the main character has a superhuman ability to withstand punishment, and then dish it out in the end with revenge violence.

My only real complaint, other than the film is not realistic in the least, is the sound, and that's largely due to the type of films that are made and shown in the popular movie theatre chains these days. It's mostly juvenile films with huge sound effects and overly loud music with a lot of teenage put down humor and ""let me show you how clever I am"" dialogue. Gone are the days of ""Kramer Versus Kramer"", and forever here are the days of ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" upon which ""Sisu"" follows in terms of action and derring-do portrayed on screen.

Every few years we do get a ""don't forget about the Nazis"" movie, and this one reminds us that they nee to be stomped out lest their brand of evil pop up again. And in this film we get enough of how and why.

An interesting action film, but not something I would see again. Some of the violence is just too graphic for me, and the film requires a lot of suspension of disbelief in order to digest the tale. But, if you need some action on your screen, then check out ""Sisu"".",literal
"Deserves its status as a cult classic! I hadn't seen the The Sandlot within the last 10 years if not longer. I like revisiting movies that I've gone a long time not watching, because I always forget some parts of the film. I thought it was hilarious the last time I watched it, but then again, I was a kid. The real test is watching a kid-oriented movie as an adult and seeing if you'll laugh. I'm happy to say I enjoyed the whole thing. It's a relatively uncomplicated story, but still manages to have plenty of humor and thought-provoking lessons. It's about 10-year-old Scott Smalls (Tom Guiry). During the summer of 1962, he moves to a new neighborhood in California with his mom and stepfather. He's a nerdy kid who prefers to stay in the house doing engineering type projects. His mom wants him to get out and have adventures before school starts. A kid who's older than him (he looked to be in his early teens) invites him to play baseball. None of the other kids like him. He's terrible at catching the ball. He gets a black eye when his stepfather is teaching him in the backyard. The older kid basically takes him under his wing, and over time his catching skills improve. He also becomes less awkward. There's a ferocious dog on the other side of a fence, so that makes for substantial comedy. It's a funny and endearing movie. Despite having been filmed in 1993, it seems to be (and I say seems because I wasn't around at that time) a realistic portrayal of how kids interacted with one another back then. Coincidentally, I was born the year this movie came out. I watch a lot of vintage TV shows and movies, and this film gets an A+ for accuracy. There is a stomach churning scene - they start throwing up on a carnival ride. Their vomit splatters down on other people. It was really gross, and the burping sound effects didn't help. So I suggest not eating while you watch this.

Some people might think this is a guys' movie. I'm a female and I loved it. It's a movie for both sexes. The only thing I can find wrong is how the filmmakers used adult material in a movie that was marketed towards children. There is some ambiguity as to whether or not it can be called family friendly, at least in my opinion anyway. It's actually quite surprising that it's rated PG, considering the dialogue is more on par with a PG-13 rating. There's a few uses of the s-word (which I didn't even remember, so that was new to me). One of the kids who's a catcher attempts to distract a batter from the opposing team by saying he can see his sister standing out in the field naked, and then I think he asked 'do you think she'll go out with me?' I thought that was out of place for a kids' film. The Sandlot is definitely a great movie for teenagers. And kids in middle school, which is 11 to 13. As long as you have consistent talks with your child about manners and boundaries, they should be able to watch a rated PG film that contains some vulgarity without imitating what they see on the screen. It's not an ideal movie for young children, but it's appropriate for 11 and older.",literal
"Great Entertaining, Informative Effort Keanu Reeves stars as a naïve angel with small wings who gets himself in trouble trying to help others outside his job designation. In a perhaps politicized version of It's a Wonderful Life (1946) as two men played by Seth Rogan and Aziz Ansari get their lives mixed up by this angel. The plot ends up turning typical expectations upside down. Reeves' character performed with sharp wry, innocent ignorance whose angel supervisor played by Sandra Oh has her hands quite full. Rogan gets a delightfully mature role as an egocentric, rich tech while Ansari gets a working class life tied to temporary jobs struggling to get by. With these actors together with a love interest, the audience absorbs a huge does of class division and strife from a enlightening movie script by Ansari that offers a potentially more divergent political party audience reception than even this year's controversial Snow Whitt (2025).

The look at the lower working class struggles and the unsympathetic lives of upper income classes is made entertainingly bearable through Reeve's ignorant irony and his performance where he appears to enjoy performing in this role. The message of this movie is made quite clear early on and could have become a tortuous film experience with another director other than Ansari himself. Ansari brings a stark authenticity to the movie under his direction, script writing, and performance without obvious commentary, letting the movie play out by itself. Good Fortune is an entertaining educational look at an American slice of life with not quite a completely convincing solution for Reeve's character and resolution. But it does manage to offer hope of the possibility of one, at least for the audience.",literal
Great show I don't like it because it's funny. I like it because of the characters. I can identify with several of the characters and can really identify with Sheldon. The people who complain about that the others are mean to Sheldon when he has some sort of mental issues is stupid. I would be happy to have friends like this. Stop complaining and enjoy the show instead or don't watch it if you don't like it.,literal
"Who has a Gallagher in their family? Where to start with Shameless? It's a fast paced dysfunctional comedy that will leaving you shaking your head. You never know what your going to get from episode to episode, except Frank being Frank. His rants will go on from time to time and are a must tune in moments. Some episodes will leave you crying, laughing, distraught, happy, and most of all mad. Every actor in Shameless has made a jump in their acting career starting with Shameless. The wild ride with every character in Shameless is just as shocking as the next. Shameless has not been afraid of changing the lead actors from season to season which gives a true dysfunctional family feel. This show can be to much if you have to many boundaries and filters. If this is not you, you will fall in love with Shameless and hate it at the same time. Perfect show for me",figurative

"A Villain Ruined by His Own Writers The show builds a nearly Machiavellian antagonist-controlled, meticulous, manipulative-only to reveal that his father and uncle had been covering every one of his screw-ups all along. He's not a criminal mastermind; he's a protected rich kid.

And just when the series had avoided the cheap ""psychopath cliché,"" the finale commits the sin anyway: it turns him into a discount Hannibal Lecter, complete with the stare, the posture, and the generic ""caged predator"" aura. It feels like a completely different character.

Episodes 1-5 are strong, Episode 6 is filler, and Episodes 7-8 collapse under rushed writing, inconsistent direction, and performances that dip through no fault of the actors.

When they going to make really tense nuclear war movies like The Day After and Theeads, but for modern times. They need to do this already.

"Better writers needed This show has potential but the writers are not good. The roles of the hacker dude and the two lesbians blur into each other, with the lesbians suddenly doing hacker work because that's the only thing the writers can think of to keep them relevant. There are many mistakes in each episode which defy logic. The series starts off at a 10 rating and each episode you watch, you remove one star, as the writers struggle to fit everyone into an episode and make mistakes with continuity. In episode 5 the bad guys car is taken out of commission, but the bad guy gets to the hostage first. The tracker sets a trap for the bad guy but hides miles away from the trap he set. It is basic, stupid things like this that ruin this show, even though the concept is unique and great.",literal

"One Epic Concert Who knew that a movie dedicated to K-Pop can turn out really something special? K-Pop Demon Hunters is a highly unique movie that takes the music genre and turn it into what's truly epic. From every minute of my viewing, I was stunned on how Sony Animation would make something that's one of their best since Spider-Verse. The story is highly intense, the animation is spectacular, the characters are all beloved, the songs bring the best moments, and the action are at their greatest. If you love K-Pop or just action movies in general, this is absolutely a must watch. And I'm sure that even non fans of K-Pop will definitely get hooked into this movie with all the epic moments and all the intensity this will have to offer. I am aware that K-Pop has been going popular from the past years. Based on my experience with this movie, I think I can start to understand why. This review is something the movie can consider a music award from me.",literal
"Season 2 is just boring I don't remember much of Season 1 anymore, but I'm quite sure that it was fun enough to watch that I was looking forward to Season 2.

Yet, when S2 happened, it turned out being a huge cringefest, at least in my opinion.

I tried watching S2E4 yesterday after watching the first three episodes a few weeks ago, but it's just too annoying, so I aborted after a few minutes. There's just nobody to care about or relate to really. Wednesday acts like being antisocial is her goal more than her nature. Pugsley is just being stupid, yet he somehow convinces his friend Eugene to act along, causing a disaster here and there, but somehow police won't get involved. The drama between Enid and Ajax is boring, so is Agnes' obsession with Wednesday. The new school principal is just cringe, so are Gomez and Morticia. School students seem to hold Wednesday in high regard, yet they keep pushing her our of her comfort zone by making her do stuff they all know she hates doing.

I couldn't care less about Tyler or Marilyn - they're both Season 1 material. Yet, they both keep getting screen time (and it seems Tyler makes a bigger return).

In the first three episodes, season 2 hasn't shown me anything that would keep me hooked. I'm just gonna drop it.",literal

I don't care.

Fact is, from what I've watched so far, I'm entertained. I can find the meaning of life from sources other than Hollywood, though I take an occasional lesson from one show or movie. Those of us that work day-to-day experience enough of what matters to know what matters. It doesn't take some heavy opus to show me the way.

At least they made Stallone what he is--70 something as opposed to 40 something, and he's acting in his zone--not overly deep.

"Couldn't get enough Although the movie was 2 1/2 hours long, it only depicted one day in court.

I watched two documentaries on the Nuremberg trials before I went to see the movie for no other reason then to try and grasp what would be exaggerated and or tweaked for today's audience. I found that it was historically close to accurate according to what we know, but falling short of the total event. This is just a snapshot. It left me wanting more.

Maybe should've been a series on HBO 10 episode episodes.

This movie depicted parallels to what's going on in the world today and how people are overlooking the signs. (We let it happen) Nazism, fascism, narcissistic leadership, Authoritarian playbooks lead to dictatorial regimes.

"Good Fortune - A Sermon Disguised as Cinema Good Fortune bills itself as a comedy, but what audiences actually get feels more like a condescending lecture wrapped in a glossy studio package. It's hard not to notice the spectacular irony: a film produced, financed, marketed, and distributed within one of the most successful capitalist entertainment machines on Earth spends nearly its entire runtime wagging a finger at capitalism itself.

The movie's message isn't subtle. In fact, it bludgeons the viewer with the kind of pseudo-revolutionary rhetoric usually found on Reddit forums. Private property? Oppression. Success? Theft. Economic mobility? A myth invented to keep the ""masses"" docile. The narrative presents life as a strict zero-sum game-if someone has more, someone else must have less. The film treats this as an unassailable truth rather than a simplistic ideological position.

But the real irritation isn't the political stance-it's the delivery. The actors speak to the audience as though addressing a room full of ""dull normals"" who must be enlightened by Hollywood sages. It's the cinematic equivalent of someone snapping their fingers in your face to make sure you're paying attention to their Very Important Message.

And beneath it all, the undertones are unmistakably collectivist-borderline propagandistic at times. The script paints capitalism as irredeemably corrupt, individuals as inherently selfish, and any form of personal success as morally suspect. Meanwhile, the entire production exists because of the same economic system it claims is evil. That's not daring. It's hypocritical.

There's nothing wrong with political commentary in film-great cinema is often political. But Good Fortune isn't engaging in thoughtful critique; it's preaching. It's a moralistic finger-wag presented with the smugness of people who seem to believe they've transcended the very system that made them wealthy celebrities.

The end result isn't provocative. It's just patronizing.

Verdict: If you're looking for entertainment, look elsewhere. If you enjoy being scolded by millionaires for participating in the economy that pays them, this might be your movie. Otherwise, it's an exercise in ideological self-congratulation-slick, shallow, and, frankly, a little disgusting.",literal

"Keep the good work up This is about FBI profilers from Quantico who are called in by the local authorities to use their knowledge of psychology and using the evidence at the crime scene to put together a profile of the person they think is guilty and using the profile to find the guilty party.

I am surprised it has taken till now to base a series on FBI profilers as when I have been watching real crime stories, the amount of times the local police have turned to the FBI and especially the Behavioural Analysis Unit are too many too count.

I think this programme is much needed as the rest of the crime based programmes because this time, it is about people who have to go into the disturbing and scary minds of serial killers and this has never been addressed that there are real agents dealing with the filth on the streets and the ways they have learnt to get past what they have seen. The characters in the show are not superheros and that is what I like about the show, we see how hard it is for them, using their skills, the crime scene and evidence to understand that person in a way so they can catch him and then they have to try to get all that person's thoughts out of their head and they find it hard to switch off from what they see.

A bonus to the show is the fact it doesn't stay in one location, the criminal activity can take them all over the United States, so we get to see the difference of how the communities handle the crimes and the aftermath in the city or small environments.

This is yet another show that has you gripped to your seat. Another good twist is that when the audience think they have figured out who is the guilty party, the show takes another surprise turn and the audience has to start again and try and think who else could be responsible. It is a thinking show and I find myself drawn into it, trying to figure out who has done it. It isn't predictable and I like that.

The show has interesting characters, brilliant actors, writers that keep audiences entertained and keep them on their toes and it is just so absorbing to watch, I get totally lost in the programme.",figurative
"Weird and unnecessary This movie was just awful. No lead up story. No in story. Some weird story. No explanation for the end of story. Just a girl who looks like the mom and is different. Why get a girl who looks like mom? How do these demon babies know anyways? Who be talking? How this deal transpire? Why not as kids? Nice neck. Just stupid and dumb. I never want to see it again.

"Promising Concept, but Falls Short Pluribus had all the ingredients to be something special, but ultimately it left me feeling underwhelmed. From the very first episode, you can see the show is trying hard to capture the same grit and intensity that made Breaking Bad such a landmark series-but unfortunately, it misses the mark in a few critical areas.

The direction by Gilligan is a standout. As always, his skill behind the camera shines through. He knows how to build tension and craft compelling scenes that keep you hooked, and his signature style is clearly present. The cinematography deserves special mention as well, with the camerawork perfectly complementing the narrative's tone. Some of the shots are absolutely stunning, and the overall visual style is one of the show's strongest aspects.

However, the real letdown comes in the casting. While the supporting roles are solid, the lead actress simply does not live up to the hype. Unfortunately, her performance feels flat and unconvincing, lacking the depth and intensity that the role demands. I really wanted to like her character, but after three episodes, I'm still not buying into her portrayal. It's frustrating, because the story itself has potential-if only the lead actress could match the ambition of the show. The character development is lacking, and instead of drawing us deeper into the plot, we're left asking for more details and a clearer direction.

The show tries so hard to emulate the Breaking Bad vibe, but it feels forced rather than organic. The storyline is intriguing, but after three episodes, there are still too many unanswered questions and the pacing is off. The will they/won't they tension just isn't enough to keep the momentum going, and you can feel the show stretching to fill the runtime without providing much in return.

In all honesty, I just want to see some classic male antagonists again. There's something about the dynamic of a strong, morally grey male lead that Pluribus seems to be lacking. The lead actress, while clearly talented, just doesn't bring the same energy to the table, and it hurts the overall experience.

In conclusion, while Pluribus has a lot going for it in terms of direction, cinematography, and potential, it struggles to deliver on the promise. It's a show that could've been great but gets bogged down by a weak lead and an unbalanced pace. I want to like it, I really do, but it's hard to get fully invested with the current shortcomings.",figurative
"Gives off The Office Vibes This show is very funny. Barb character a manager reminds me of Michael from office. I'd like the chemistry between all the actors. Just like everybody else in America, I made at least one daily trip per year to DMV. And this really portrays how a lot of of us have been feeling. The DMV employee is goofing off purposely slowing down work. Take an advantage of unauthorized breaks. I recommend a show to anybody looking for a good laugh.",literal

"Mid level and confused Throughout the movie, it needed to decide what it was trying to do. Had potential with the cast and some of the direction it seemed to be heading in but generally felt like it was trying to be a variety of different things at once.

Whilst I can commend a number of the performances for their commitment in their roles, it seemed to sway throughout between Dark horror and snazzy humour... But unfortunately frequently missed the mark and landed weakly.

The amount of random musical elements only made sense about half the time and I do have to question how much of that ""Italian wine"" The director had slurped before filming chunks of this movie.

I can respect it tried a have some sense of originality and it wasn't an absolutely terrible movie but just didn't live up to the hype in the end for me.",literal
"Love Is Blind Handsomely reckless sportsman Rock Hudson (as Robert ""Bob"" Merrick) crashes his speedboat and survives, miraculously unscratched. However, Mr. Hudson's medical treatment inadvertently contributes to the death of a beloved doctor. It doesn't seem fair that a hero (Dr. Phillips) dies while a heel (Mr. Hudson) is saved. The good doctor's widow Jane Wyman (as Helen) becomes acquainted with Hudson and rejects his amorous advances. Hudson decides to change his ways by secretly doing good deeds. Despite his handsomeness and wealth, Ms. Wyman continues to spurn Hudson. His ""Magnificent Obsession"" with Wyman leads Hudson to make another tragic event occur, but love could eventually conquer all...

Producer Ross Hunter delivered the goods and director Douglas Sirk turned some silly soap operas into high cinematic art. With this one, Mr. Sirk is very much like a painter, brushing light and shadows across the screen. Watching the movement of characters and cameras will reveal additional brush strokes. The characters are always doing something. Nobody has to just stand there and say their lines, which is nice for those on both sides of the screen. It's all so smooth, even when Hudson drunkenly holds up the ""DANGER"" sign for the wide screen camera before bonding with philosophical pipe-holder Otto Kruger (as Edward ""Ed"" Randolph). And, it's pleasingly ludicrous, although the final quarter is a bit less artful.

"Now You See Me Critique. Now You See Me Now You See Me is an action and suspense movie. Is a movie about four magicians that came together to do magic tricks and be famous. The stars of the movie are Jessie Einsenberg, Woody Harrelson, Dave Franco, Isla Fisher, Mark Ruffalo, Morgan Freeman and Melanie Laurent. The movie take place in 3 principal places that are Las Vegas, San Francisco and New York.

Now You See Me is a mysterious movie that starts with four street magician's name, Daniel Atlas, Merritt McKinney, Henley Reeves and Jack Wilder. A mysterious stranger slips to them a card with an address and that's when they met. A year later after they receive the card, the magicians did one of the biggest magic shows in Las Vegas and became known as ""The Four Horseman."" The magic show they did brought them to serious problems that made the FBI, and an Interpol from France to look after them. Not only the FBI was after them but a former magician named Thaddeus Bradey who makes money by reveling the secrets of magician's tricks. The Four Horseman did another trick and didn't care who were trying to put them on jail and who they will betrayed. This next trick included stealing, escaping, revenge, hypnotizing and lies. After that The Horseman made their final trick, the biggest trick. 

As I wrote before Now You See Me is a movie that take place in different places for example Las Vegas. Their first show was in Las Vegas. In their first show they made it seem so really when they travel to the bank of France. They manage to disappear all the money from the bank of France and appear in France. Later on, when the police were chasing them because they stole bank,they travel to San Francisco for their second show. For their second show the illusionist give away all the money from their producer to the audience that have been victims from their producers company. After giving away all the money, again the police, their producer and Thaddeus Bradey were after them. 

Now You See Me had an amazing cast. One of the stars of the movie Jessie Eisenberg known from his roles in Zombieland and Social Network now plays an action role as an illusionist. Also the actor Woody Harrelson known from his role as Haymitch in The Hunger Games made a great job playing a hypnotist and a mentalist. Woody is the one who gives a comedy touch to the movie. Dave Franco actuation was really good, he can really play a kick ass character and an illusionist. Isla Fisher, the only girl in The Four Horseman, did a great job giving life to the sexy magician Henley. I think the first trick Isla performed to the audience was really awesome and we can see how perfect she was for this role. In The Movie Now You See Me I would have like to know with more details about who The Four Horseman were before becoming famous magicians. Also I would have like to see the evolution of two of the actors love story. Also what I really missed about almost the end of the movie was the participation of the character Jack Wilder in their last big magic show. He would have be amazing performing one last time with the other magicians.

Now You See Me was the best second selling movie in the time it was released. Meaning many people liked the movie. In the movie all of the actors made an amazing job. Something that I really liked about the movie that every time they played incredible tricks, they used distraction. Distraction was the main element of the movie. The Four Horseman always did something to distract the audience while the real magic was happening in other place. One of the lines that I really like about the movie and that was basically what the movie was about, was the line said by Daniel Atlas at the beginning of the movie. The line says: Daniel Atlas: ""Come in close. Closer. Because the more you think you see the easier it'll be to fool you."" In my opinion I rate this movie with 10/10. I really recommend this movie not only to the action audience but to everyone because it is full of suspense and excitement. I know you will enjoy it.",literal
"a trippy one from Ari Aster Greetings again from the darkness. It's frightening to see how societal norms and individual behavior have shifted over the past five years. It seems clear that the COVID Pandemic was a turning point ... or at a minimum, an accelerant. Writer-director Ari Aster (MIDSOMMER, 2019; HEREDITARY, 2018) uses this as a theme in this Neo-noir Western that takes place in a small fictional town in 2020 New Mexico as the pandemic was kicking into gear.

You should know upfront that Aster serves up a giant pot of cinematic vegetable soup. Topics touched on include: politics, racism, pedophilia, Antifa, gun rights, Black Lives Matter, White guilt, envy, divisiveness, murder, conspiracy theories, George Floyd, David Hogg, face masks, social distancing mandates, cults, ambition, abortion, and Native American land rights. If that's not enough for you, the film also includes an abundance of dark comedy and the final act features a barrage of violence. Just writing that is exhausting, yet nowhere near as exhausting as watching this film.

Oscar winner Joaquin Phoenix (JOKER, 2019) stars as Sheriff Joe Cross, an odd man in a white hat who dares challenge his rival, the sitting town Mayor, Ted Garcia (Pedro Pascal) for the office in the upcoming election. Cross is the one who eschews wearing a mask, while Garcia is the smooth-talking type who encourages commitment to the mandates. The differences between the men are obvious when we see Garcia's heart-warming (pandering) TV ad as contrasted to Cross' campaign car sign with ""You're"" spelled ""Your"". The two men don't like each other, a situation exacerbated by rumors of a long-ago incident between Garcia and Cross' wife, Louise (two-time Oscar winner Emma Stone).

Being ill-equipped to run an election, even with the assistance of his two deputies, Michael (Michael Ward, EMPIRE OF LIGHT, 2022) and Guy (Luke Grimes, ""Yellowstone""), isn't the extent of Cross' problems. His marriage to Louise is rocky at best, and having her mother, Dawn (Deidre O'Connell, a talented actor in TV and movies since the 1980's) live with them and spew her conspiracy theories only adds to the bumpy ride. Things get worse for Joe when Louise grows close to charismatic but vacuous cult leader Vernon (Austin Butler) ... a guru who manages to calmly say things that rile folks up in a hollow-cause kind of way.

Cinematographer Darius Khondji works his magic with a film that bounces all over the place thematically. In traditional Westerns, it was always good versus evil; however, this contemporary version is more political and seems to lack any people who are actually good. Joaquin Phoenix goes all in for his role, and Pedro Pascal continues to prove he can play just about any character. Emma Stone and Austin Butler take on minor roles, while Deidre O'Connell gets to shine in a couple of scenes. Don't believe for a second that filmmaker Aster is attempting to explain how we've reached this moment. It's more a snapshot in time of how people react under extreme pressure and how everyone has a snapping point. Is the film provocative or is Aster just having fun stirring the pot? Talk amongst yourselves (after watching).

"Jurassic World Rebirth Spoiler Free Jurassic World Rebirth attempts to breathe new life into the franchise with a sleek cast and a high-stakes premise, but the results are a mixed for me.

Scarlett Johansson leads the charge as Zora, tasked with assembling a team to infiltrate a dinosaur-infested island. Their mission? Extract genetic samples from key species to engineer a cure that could change the world. It's a classic Jurassic setup science meets survival in a prehistoric nightmare but with a more focused, character driven approach.

One of the film's standouts is Mahershala Ali as Duncan. Every moment he's on screen crackles with presence and quiet intensity. Frankly, it felt like he could have carried the entire film solo. His performance adds weight to a story that sometimes struggles to balance its tones.

Unfortunately, not all characters are created equal. Four supporting characters, introduced as a stranded family unit, feel oddly disconnected from the main storyline. Their subplot often filled with poorly written dialogue and awkward humor feels like it belongs in a different movie entirely. While they do intersect with the main group eventually, their scenes dilute the tension and momentum built by Zora's team.

David Iacono's character, Xavier, is particularly uneven. He has several flat comedic lines that feel forced, yet he redeems himself with a heartfelt bonding scene that briefly injects some genuine emotion into the film.

The action is solid, and the island setting is as thrilling and dangerous as ever, but tonal inconsistencies and unnecessary characters bog it down. It's fun, sure but forgettable. It's what I'd call a ""popcorn movie"" entertaining enough at the moment, but unlikely to leave a lasting impression. If this ends up being the last entry in the Jurassic saga, I won't feel like we missed out on anything groundbreaking.",literal
"What did I just watch? I had mixed feelings about this movie. On the one hand, it was interesting and captivating-it kept you in suspense, in worry, in curiosity, and that's good. But on the other hand, about an hour in, I had this moment of, ""Jesus Christ, how long has it been?"" I checked the time. It's only been one hour. It's a two-hour movie. And by that point, I kept listening to this conspiracy theorist guy talking nonsense, and I was getting annoyed. I kept thinking, oh my god, will he just shut up? Because that's how it is in real life-some people just talk out of their butts, can't be convinced of anything, and reject everything except what they believe. His beliefs were unshakeable and rigid like a stump. Every time she tried to make a counterpoint, he'd twist it and say: ""Oh, that's exactly what you'd say because you're an alien."" And he was saying nonsense conspiracy talking points which made no sense. After an hour of this, I started getting annoyed because this is how people nowadays like to argue online and especially in politics. It goes nowhere, and is useless. And it just started to make me mad.

While it's supposed to be a comedy with Stavros, the comedian, you think it'd to be more jokey-but then it turns too dark and gory, especially the final scene. It's just unnecessarily dark. Death is used as a prop. Kind of like a exploitation film. I just looked at my phone for that part, instead of the bodies.

The one redeeming thing is the twist at the end, but I kind of saw it coming because I read that it was sci-fi in the description, therefore I knew that there must be aliens in the movie. I liked the twist at the end because the guy, the main antagonist, becomes the protagonist at the end. She turns out to be an alien, but it didn't feel real. It felt more like we entered the conspiracy guy's imagination, rather than reality. We entered his fever dream. We are really seeing her become an alien, as he envisioned it. It's hard to decide whether we are now in his imagination or it's really happening and she is truly an alien. I don't know. Nor do I care. The movie's a mess and in poor taste because of too much death for no justifiable reason, and the annoying character of the conspiracy theorist guy irritated me. The movie is just ugly and it made me feel annoyed. 5/10.",literal

"Once you start you'll never be able to stop it will obsess you but it will be a ""Magnificent Obsession""! ***SPOILERS***I give the movie ""Magnificent Obsession"" eight stars for it's story and at least five handkerchiefs for it's schmaltz and also appreciate it for being the movie that made Rock Hudson, Dr. Bob Merrick & Robbie Robinson, the Hollywood legend both on and off the screen that he eventually became.

Living in the fast lane with fast cars and speedboats as well as women, that he drops almost as soon as he picks up, spoiled playboy Bob Merrick is anything other then what he makes himself out to be; a spoiled and overindulgent adult who's only care in the world is himself and himself alone and what to do best with his millions in order to make himself happy. This life of fun and games comes to a crashing end for Bob when he, going at speeds up to 180 MPH, crashes his speedboat and ends up near dead in the collision.

In order to save this good for nothing fun and adventure seeker, Bob Merrick, the ambulance crew that rescued him had to borrow a resuscitator from the nearby Dr. Wayne Phillips' home the very moment that Dr. Phillips suffered a massive heart-attack killing him. A great and wonderful man, Dr. Phillips, had to die in order to save a good for nothing and self-indulgent bum, Bob Merrck, but when we go on to hear, from the people who knew him, just what a wonderful and unselfish person the doctor was he wouldn't have wanted it any other way.

Leaving a wife Hellen, Jane Wyman, and step daughter Joyce, Barbara Rush, behind Dr. Phillips was found to be bankrupt even with his hospital doing round the clock business with the local inhabitants. It turns out that Dr. Phillips never charged anyone for his services that amounted in the hundreds of thousands of dollars and even more odd never, until he died and was in no position to tell anyone anything, allowed those he treated to tell anyone not even their closest relatives of his good deeds!

Merrick finds out by accident when he illegally checks out of the hospital, while still suffering from a brain concussion, that his life was saved at the expense of Dr. Phillips when he's picked up hitch-hiking by the late doctors grieving wife Helen. Confused and trying to be, for the first time in his life, humble and apologetic Bob makes a fool of himself in trying to pay off Helen with a check of $25,000.00 for all the trouble that he caused her and her step-daughter as a result of his wild lifestyle.

It's later in the movie when Bob drinking and womanizing as usual at a local watering hole gets himself juiced up and then, barley being able to walk, gets in his sports car and smashed it into the fence at artist Edward Randolph, Otto Kruger, home he finally sees the light. Letting the now drunk and black and blue Bob sleep it off Edward gives him an insight of what a kind and wonderful person Dr. Phillips was and how he effected his life, and the life of everyone else that he came into contact with for the better. Slowly but surly the effect, of what Edward told him about Dr. Phillips, starts to take hold of Bob in him trying to makes thing better not just with Helen & Joyce but everyone else that he knows which was soon to become his magnificent obsession. Bob does all that but at a very heavy price a price that cost Helen her sight.

Causing Helen to have an accident by trying to apologize to her in jumping into a cab that she was a passenger in Helen runs out on the street and is hit by a speeding car knocking her down and blinding her. A shocked and startled Bob is really up the creek now with him having on his conscience not only Dr. Phillips death but his wife's serious injury as well! Bob vows to do everything in his power to make things right for Hellen and everyone else that he screwed over the years and does it by becoming, what seemed to me, the reincarnation of Doctor Phillips himself: kind understanding unselfish and most of all doing everything he can to help his fellow man and woman. And on top of all that not wanting a red cent for it but also not wanting anyone else to know that he did it, for free, either.

The second half of the film is a bit too schmaltzy for my taste, I have to watch my cholesterol level, but still I can understand and appreciate it. The motivation that drives Bob, now using the name Robbie Robinson, in getting to help and at the same time fall in love with sightless, and she with him, Helen has him going so far as to enroll back into medical school that he once dropped out of. Becoming a top brain surgeon himself Bob gets the best brain and eye surgeons in the world to operate on Helen to give her back her sight. Bob and Helen soon realizes that it's hopeless that she'll ever see again, from what the battery of eye specialists told them, and with Helen now knowing that Robbie is really Bob, and forgives him for what he did, she checks out and ends up in a sanitarium in New Mexico dying from pneumonia.

Finding out where Helen is Bob flies down from NYC to New Mexico in a last effort to both save her life and his conscience but in the end he get's an extra bonuses in his noble and unselfish efforts. Becoming a brain surgeon and suffering from the guilt of his sorry and self-indulgent past Bob did, due to this magnificent obsession that took hold of him, what no one else in the entire world of medicine could do: He gave Helen back her sight!",literal
"How on earth is this a good family movie? ""The Sandlot"" is a movie about a new kid in town named Scotty who tries to fit in with a group of misfits by learning the game of baseball and playing it with them. At first he sticks out like a sore thumb, but as he begins to develop a knack for the game, he fits right in. Together the group and Scotty enjoy great games of baseball and wonderful misadventures in their small town. Sure, it sounds like a harmless family comedy, but there was nothing funny about it at all, and I sure wouldn't want to put my family through the torture of watching this painfully unfunny movie.

There was very little to like in this movie. First of all, ""The Sandlot"" isn't quite the brightest idea in the first place. It's just a bunch of kids playing baseball and getting into trouble. How could that be funny? How could that even be a movie worth watching? I know that when the idea first comes to mind it sounds brilliant, but simply toying with it one realizes that it has no entertainment value at all. 

Second of all, the actors who portrayed the kids had no experience (and in some cases no talent) with acting whatsoever. I understand that maybe there were not a lot of great child actors back in 1993, but the characters and the actors who played them were trying too hard to portray themselves as dim-witted and silly but strangely likable, and as a result they come off as just plain dumb and unlikeable. James Earl Jones was the only person who did a good job in this movie, but he loses credibility for being in such a disastrous film in the first place. 

The third thing that makes this such a bad movie was the poorness of the script. All of the jokes fell so flat on their faces that thinking about them now makes me wonder if they were intended to be funny in the first place.""The Sandlot"" could have been somewhat likable if the script wasn't poorly written and filled with dumb jokes about vomiting on fair rides and rival baseball teams throwing worthless insults at each other, but yet for some strange reason the director and writer went against logic and made the movie as unwatchable as possible.

Some of the baseball scenes weren't dreadful, but they were not exactly enjoyable either. It was almost like watching a little league game at times. But, it was a pointless, kind of annoying little league game, with irritating players who weren't as good as they could be. This movie is like taking such excellent family movies as ""Field of Dreams"" and ""Finding Nemo"" and combining them in a blender with such boring and unfunny films as ""The Scout"" and the movie adaptation of ""The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy"", and in the end it all adds up to one huge headache of a family movie. 

I highly recommend avoiding ""The Sandlot"", for it is a terrible family film and a bad movie altogether. If you feel the need to view this anyway, just be warned that not even the slightly watchable baseball games and the brief appearance by James Earl Jones can save this horrid film from being one of the worst family movies ever made.

It may not convert most cinema goers for those who dislike this kind of movie franchise's but this one has taken a dramatic leap of logic, but fans will find it as a confident, stylish return of movie form. This is typically just like the other past two movies with a familiar story and plot to plan the ultimate steal .This film is a more creative story and a much flashier clever crowd pleaser and a very well-executed storyline The pacing of the movie is very slick and agile, it shifts between its clever high tech illusions, its globe trotting escape acts and definitely its clever reversals. While a few bizarre twists during the film it glows with confidence.",literal
"The Office meets Black Mirror I am absolutely in love with this series after 2 episodes. Everything from the aesthetics to the acting and intriguing plot. Definitely worth watching. I hate having to wait until next week to watch a new episode though!

It's definitely similar to Black Mirror episodes because of the technology and psychological aspects. But it's got some funny moments and seems less morbid, at least so far.

**edit, changed my review from 9 to 10 stars after watching the entire season.",literal
"Last season went off the rails. It's certainly not an edgy series and the Cornish characters seem (ARH,ARH,ARH) writ for TV, but it's quite entertaining. Being old I preferred the older series, and perhaps due to my age this one seemed less sophisticated. The last season was quite a let down. What with Warleggan's bouts of lunacy, Ned's bouts of senselessness, and Ross's bouts of concreteness, it became obvious that the writers decided to go for high ( on cocaine) drama instead of a reasonable tying up of loose ends.",literal
"What a ride! From the first episode, this show never took me where I expected to go. It was a delight to just let go of all my preconceived notions and just go along for the ride!

And what an amazing cast! As soon as I saw that lineup, I knew this was going to be brilliant. Allison Janney never fails. Kristen Wiig blew me away! Can someone please tell me how the entire cast managed to look SO fabulous and young!? I was convinced they somehow managed to film this twenty years ago when everyone was younger (until I realized Mitzi would have been a baby!). The sets and costumes are so stunning I had to go back and rewatch for all the beautiful details!",literal
"Wednesday The series is very wonderful, but there are some bad things, such as the characters of the boys and their presence only to distract the viewers or add emotional relationships, but the series made us go through an adventure full of wonderful events and successive shocks until it makes you doubt half of the characters. A series that I will always remember and will not hesitate to return to. I'm really looking forward to next season and hope they finish it quickly. I can't wait and hope it won't be less than the previous season. Thank you Netflix and all the staff, crew, and everyone who helped make this work possible.",literal
"Loved this show! I think the negative reviews are mostly people that gave up too soon on the series. Sadly it's not always about instant gratification!

The show gets funnier and more ridiculous as each episode passes. Ridiculous in a good way.

The cast is fantastic Kristen Wiig really plays the hell out of Maxine. Alison Janney is deliciously evil. Ricky Martin plays a great role and special mention to Carol Burnett... her character goes on quite the journey and it was gripping to see where she was heading.

I found everything about the show utterly engaging. Sure it's not to be taken too seriously but that is the point.",figurative
"Fantastic, atmospheric, binge worthy! Amazing production and brilliant cast. Music is top notch, love the blend of historic sea shantyesque with modern rap. Wonderful costumes that deserve an award, you won't regret watching this series 👏. Loved seeing James Norton as the bad guy. You will know some of the cast from GOT, Sandman, Outlander.",literal
"Superb storyline and acting.... Its been awhile since I've seen such quality series.

Acting was sublime - superb and realistic - lead actor was eminently believable as a gritty, tough nosed, no nonsense cop. The supporting cast were also perfect in their respective roles.

Storyline was again superb - solid and fast paced enough to keep you on the edge of your seat and laced with the supernatural - just enough to be believable. The cast was perfect to make the whole show work.

So much better than the other more well-known shows making rounds.

Hope this show wont be abandoned and looking forward so much to a third season..",literal
"Overhyped for sure Went to see this because I like vampire movies, and Tom Cruise endorsed it. Never saw him endorsing any movies so I got more curious.

Production, costume, make up, visuals are very good.

Story is meh. Standard vampire look and behavior. Another movie implying some faith doesn't work in fighting demons but a voodoo mojo does, nothing new there.

I dislike musicals so its musical parts added nothing for me. The past and future music evoked could have been more abstract, but they were real people in different eras costumes mingling in, kinda ruined the believability of the 1930s vibe for me. Looked like a silly company dinner and dance instead.

Can totally see certain demographic overhyping this. Again, nothing new.

An okay watch overall, fun at times.",literal
"A Must See The Running Man is an exciting thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat as you watch Ben Richards compete in the most dangerous game show in the future. Glen Powell hit it out of the park with his performance and has the qualities of a movie star, and I've been following his progress since Top Gun: Maverick. Edgar Wright's impeccable screenplay, cinematography, and directing elevate this movie beyond the 1987 original.",literal
"""If she is so smart, why is she a cleaner?"" So, first things first - I enjoyed the pilot. (I will update as the show goes on). I will be honest, I'm a Kaitlin Olsen fan. She is great in Always Sunny, was great in The Mick (which was cancelled too soon!!!! #Justice4SofiaBlack-D'Elia) Olsen is good in this, plays the character with a nice balance of endearing but also obnoxious. A lesser actress would've made this character too annoying and torpedoed the show from the jump.

So, the biggest gripe I see is people saying ""if she is so smart, then why is she a cleaning lady?""

I think the first episode answers this... and maybe I'm reading into it too much. However, I think the implication is that she is so intelligent, catches so many details, that a ""regular job"" or a job where she is working under anyone... would drive her insane. She would catch so many mistakes/problems - that should would either spend her nights awake in frustration thinking about them, or get herself fired by blunting telling bosses/superiors whenever they were doing something stupid/making a mistake.

It is also, clear from the pilot, that the disappearance of her oldest daughter's father has caused considerable emotional damage to her. Being the High IQ problem solver she is, she is hyper-fixated on that mystery which likely affects her ability to hold a regular job.

Also also, the fact that she has a high IQ - most high IQ people are hyper focused on specific things, but their personal lives are in considerable disorder.

From my interpretation of the first episode, she works as a cleaning lady at night because it allows her to be home with her kids during the day and most importantly - she is working for ""herself"" and not having to interact with people. (Interacting with people either leads to confrontations, problems for her to solve, or problems that she isn't able to solve but will stay awake thinking about).

It works! It makes sense. You have to suspend disbelief that same amount as ANY OTHER police procedural with a genius/Sherlock Holmes character.

The Mentalist was the same thing, a guy that was incredibly observant, that could be doing anything, but chooses - for personal reasons - to work with the authorities to solve crimes, even though they don't have a background in law enforcement.

I am looking forward to seeing where this goes, there is crime, mystery, comedy, and seems like it will have a fair bit of drama. Missing first love, a mom who feels emotions deeply and doesn't want her daughter to feel like she doesn't fit in to the family. A teen daughter that feels like she doesn't fit in and is only a half sibling to her younger brother and sister. Lots of potential drama to explore there.

So far so good!

Btw 7/10 for me is a really really solid TV show score.

Update: the show has dropped down a point for me after the most recent episode. Too much nonsense... mishandling of evidence, why is she involved in interrogations? She has a great eye for detail so they higher her to help... that doesn't give her the authority or expertise to interrogate suspects. Worst of all in episode 3 was the ending where the guy FaceTimes his mother. He is being arrested for murder... a murder that was committed because his mother was being preyed upon by a guy who stole all her money... So, he was being arrested for murder, they let him FaceTime to pretend he had moved to Colorado and wouldn't be seeing his mother anymore... but as I explained, she was involved with his motivation for murder... so she will be called as a witness for his trial. At the very least she will be aware of it. The show makes you think that the detectives are also judge and jury. It's just all too silly. I will continue watching when convenient but won't be going out of my way to watch this show.",figurative
"One of the worst movies I've ever seen. I'm all for brainless action/horror movies with lots of gore and nudity. Unfortunately, Le Pacte des Loups tries to be more than that, which makes the entire movie unbelievable. After a short setup, the film starts with a shot of pretentious religious imagery. Two strangers arrive and then save some woman and her father. One of the strangers is a martial-arts ass-kicking spiritual Native American (HE HAS A F*CKING TOMAHAWK AND MAGICAL HEALING POWDER FOR GOD'S SAKE! YEESH.) stereotype and the other is a dashing daring French hero main-character stereotype. It should be noted that the two hardly talk to each other throughout the entire film, which makes the last third of the film illogical and stupid. In fact, all of the characters are pretty much one-dimensional. The acting is not bad (it's not amazing either) given what the actors had to work with. Onto the plot: The film is a horror film wrapped by French royal court and religious intrigue. But since the film is mainly a horror film, the other stuff is just mentioned in passing and thus the imagery seems pretentious. Especially when you consider that the main character is resurrected. (Also, at one point the Native American character is laid out with his arms spread in a crucifixion position in a room where there is religious imagery all over the ceiling. Hmmm.) Anyway, to sum it up, the plot is stupid and unbelievable and the film is filled with gothic and religious imagery. None of that would matter if the film was a brainless action film. Unfortunately, the martial arts was pathetic. Maybe I've been spoiled by the fight scenes of some recent films (e.g. Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon) but I thought most of the battles were pretty lame. There's a lot of dodging and slowmotion kicks. Nothing spectacular. The final battle was funny because the French-guy main character, who suddenly gained kick-boxing abilities in the middle of the film, shoots flaming ARROWS (HE HAD A FREAKING GUN!) at people and SCALPS a guy. As I mentioned before, the movie sucked because instead of being a normal action/horror movie (the action is horrible; it's scary if you consider wolves in a procupine suit scary) it tries to throw in religious themes (which isn't in the film enough to justify all the freaking imagery everywhere. Even the Native American character is part of the imagery.) Oh yeah, most of the plot of the 2 and 1/2 hour movie makes no sense too. There was a lot of gore and nudity, which is always good. But I'd have to say that this movie is utter crap.",figurative
"Like watching an epic grand opera Actually watched 'The Sopranos' for the first time just before the final season was about to end, when at the age where watching 15 plus certificate films and shows was allowed. It left a big impression on me even then, back when my knowledge of film and such was actually pretty limited (am still learning). Especially for the very much missed James Gandolfini, the unyielding storytelling (if by late teens standard a little too much at times) and the complexity of the writing.

'The Sopranos' is often on lists of the greatest shows ever made and one of the few to be near-universally acclaimed everywhere, and it is a distinction that is richly deserved. It really is that masterful and it not only is every bit as wonderful as remembered but also even better, due to understanding more of the material and themes and appreciating uncompromising approaches to tough subjects a lot more. Watching 'The Sopranos' feels so much more than watching a television show, it's like watching an epic grand opera and there is really not much to add to what has already been said.

Gandolfini plays an enormous part in what makes 'The Sopranos' so brilliant. He is absolutely masterful as one of the most iconic and most complex TV characters to have ever existed, full of chilling intensity but also equally powerful nuance. All the cast are fabulous in their fascinatingly written, compellingly real roles as well, coming over as real people with strengths and flaws and not caricatures. The chemistry scintillates throughout between the whole cast, every emotion in all the universal and relatable issues covered embodied.

Writing is also of exceptionally high quality, very hard boiled with a lot of gritty edge but with enough subtlety to avoid heavy handedness. It never felt soap operatic or heavy in melodrama, and the crackling energy of it and the amount of thought probing and emotional complexity there is is non stop. The storytelling is consistently transfixing in one of the few shows to exist to not have a bad season or an episode that disgraces the show, faltering only a little with the abrupt feeling latter stages of the final episode which was not enough to ruin what was absolute perfection up to then. The atmosphere never holds back and hits hard while not being in your face or gratuitous, nothing feels glamourised or sugar-coated.

Production values are tremendously stylish and cinematic worthy, while the music fits beautifully throughout. Direction is pacey and tight, while sympathetic enough in more intimate parts.

Summing up, one of the greatest shows ever made and a work of art. One of the easiest 10/10s given so far this year.",literal
"Painfull to watch I feel bad for all the huge actor names included in this really really bad movie. You can't compare the original with this cliche after cliche scene trying to be called - a movie. A child would be a better director than this guy. I wouldn't let him direct a school play, not another movie. Only bought people or one's with horrible taste could give this such an overrated review. Be free to hate me but this was a major waste of my time - and I watched a great number of bad movies over the years.",figurative
"Not impressed 1/5 STARS - I just watched Die My Love and, after reading about the novel it's based on, I'm certain I'd feel the same way about the book as I do about the movie. The acting is fine, the cinematography is fine-but the film drags endlessly and feels like it will never end.

It also comes across as annoyingly pretentious in its attempts to portray a woman's descent into madness and postpartum depression. The problem is that when we first meet Grace, we're given almost no time to connect with her before she unravels. So instead of watching a gradual breakdown, she just seems unstable from the start, making it hard to care about her journey-or lack thereof.

Before long, I found myself yearning for this self-absorbed, tedious exercise in frustration to just be over. The story blurs the line between reality and delusion so vaguely that it's often unclear what's even happening. The supposed affair with the motorcycle helmet guy feels like a weird fever dream (apparently it's real in the book-which somehow makes it worse).

In the end, I'm still not sure what really happened to this violent, self-absorbed mess of a woman who shows no real desire to improve or heal. And honestly? I don't care. I'm just not a fan of abstract, nebulous, meandering, self-important works of ""art.""

Many reviews seem eager to praise Jennifer Lawrence's performance, but to me, it just felt like Jennifer Lawrence playing Jennifer Lawrence-only louder. She was fine, but far from transformative.

Not impressed, not moved, and I can't recommend this one.

"This is a must see ! A gripping historical drama with real-life stakes, Death by Lightning electrifies with its taut storytelling and powerhouse performances. Matthew Macfadyen is mesmerizing as Charles Guiteau, capturing the assassin's delusions with chilling precision. Michael Shannon brings gravitas and quiet dignity to President James A. Garfield, while Nick Offerman surprises with a layered portrayal of Chester A. Arthur. Bradley Whitford and Shea Whigham round out the cast with sharp, compelling turns as Senators Blaine and Conkling. This limited series doesn't just recount history; it resurrects it with urgency and emotional depth.",literal
"Another Great Yorgos Lanthimos Film I am a big fan of Yorgos Lanthimos as a director from his previous films like ""Poor Things"" and ""Kinds of Kindness"", both of which I think are among the best movies of recent years. I also liked ""The Lobster"".

Now he is back with his former collaborators, actors Jesse Plemons and Emma Stone in the new film ""Bugonia"", which I think is another contender for best film of the year.

The story is about two men who kidnap a CEO because they think she is an alien trying to destroy the earth. Emma Stone plays the CEO and Jesse Plemons plays one of the kidnappers.

They both give excellent performances worthy of an Academy Award nomination. And the film is superbly shot by the cinematographer Robbie Ryan. I think this is the most beautifully photographed movie I have seen all year. And the production design and the music score are both very good. I recommend this movie to anyone who has enjoyed the previous work of Yorgos Lanthimos. A bizarre but enjoyable film.",figurative
"what a great show seriously out of all the t.v. that i watch, which seems to be a lot, ncis has to be my favorite. All the great actors including Mark Harmon, Michael Weatherly (hottie!), Sasha Alexander as the main characters. I think what makes ncis rise above the rest of the crime shows, is the in-depth personalities that each main character has. Every episode is something completely different and offers a great hour of enjoyment. Humour though, i think is the key to ncis's success. For a crime show to be funny, but still uphold it's great plots is something the directors should be applauded for. Mark Harmon is an asset to the show offering a familiar (not to forget hot!) face, as does Michael Weatherly who plays the womanizing, yet cutie Tony DiNozzo, while his partner Caitin Todd played by Sasha Alexander offers good competition and a down to earth personality. Not to forget the goth forensic scientist Abby and Autopsy's Ducky who top off the wonderful cast. Ten out of Ten, watch it on channel ten, 9.30pm Wednesday night!

please, if your a massive fan of ncis, visit my website www.ilovencis.com it has everything you want to know about the show and actors!",literal
"just Ok , but Chris has a future in filming (long review) *Some people are bashing this movie because it takes everything from previous movies and just mixes it together (which it does), but most ""first from someone"" usually takes things that they love and put it in their first product.

*Is this a perfect movie, come one man, of course not. Is it the worst thing ever created like some people are saying? Of course not. It is very mid, BUT it does show that Chris does in fact have some potential to make better films in the future.

*""Schadenfreude"" is what describes most people. We just love to see someone fail, and some people have failed themselves or have no life and therefore they root for a person who is trying to do something, to fail. Most are just people in the basement that will never do anything in life, and are probably overweight.

*But I think this movie has already broke even with just 3-4 days in the theaters, so Chris definitely is making another film. I just hope he gets a more experience person on his crew to sort of guide him through some screenwriting issues such as dialogue and character development (which are sort of bad in this movie), as well being more original.

*This movie is a mix bag of Blair Witch Project, Resident Evil 7, Rosemary's Baby, Antichrist (at least for me I got some Antichrist vibes), Silent Hill, Evil Dead, and a few more. It is also a weird movie structure that has a very bad intro in my opinion (which was super long and boring), that just dumps a ton of exposition to you in the first 15 minutes or so. It went on forever, but after a certain dude ""offs"" himself, the movie then picks up a bit.

*The middle is spent with the main lead mostly doing some very small investigations, watching a tape over and over to see any clues, and then the movie picks up (but also becomes insanely crazy).

*She suddenly finds a clue on the tape and she decides to go to an abandoned prison in the middle of the night and ends up meeting a CGI hell hound and Satan himself (which was just completely out of left field). From here the character does some very stupid things.

*She runs for her life scared, gets in her car, and then decides to just keep driving to Shelby Oaks and as soon as she arrives, she sees the hellhound again and she is scared, but then starts following it. It eventually leads her to an abandoned cabin with an obviously creepy evil old woman there, and it is quickly revealed her sister is there. She finds her sister but she does another stupid thing and leaves her giant knife behind, so now she is weaponless.

*Here comes the part where I thought it was extremely cool, the old fat lady comes and gives chase but she can teleport around with the shadow of Satan behind her (the effects was pretty cool I thought for a low budget film). Unfortunately the final 15 minutes is absolutely insane and also makes no sense.

*The old lady is doing some satanic ritual and smearing her blood all over a baby that is in the attic (which was the missing sisters baby that she gave birth too after getting ""rosemary's babied"" by Satan""). The problem is that the old lady uses powers to throw them around and knock them out, transfer Satan into the baby, and then die of blood loss.

*The main character sees this but she makes a very strange decision to keep the baby and bring it home. Later on the missing sister is recovering but wakes up to kill the demon baby, the main character comes in and they struggle and she accidentally knocks her missing sister out her window, and knocks her out. Out of no where 3-4 hellhounds comes out and just eats her like WTF. Then suddenly Satan stands behind the main girl, touches her shoulder, and her eyes turn demonic and it ends.

***Ok, so this movie had problems, trust me, it does. It is just that the script isn't original and also just doesn't make much sense, like how the main character finds her sister after 7 long years of desperately searching for her, only to bring her home safely, only to unintentionally cause her death just mere days after rescuing her. It is sort of a poor script with some cool moments.

*****Overall, props to Chris for going out of Youtube and making a movie and actually getting it release in theaters. It actually looks like a real movie, not some low budget home made looking movie (where the FPS is at 30 and the color and sound is bad).

6/10 (not original at all, but I like how crazy the ending got and just how nothing really makes sense in the end)",literal
"Could not stop watching Ok, the acting is pretty bad in some scenes but the story line is completely engaging to the point I couldn't stop watching. Lots of twist and turns all connecting to the same central character. Interesting backdrops to the action, fast moving, different plot to the average show. The 9/10 is a score based entirely on the directing and plot. I often struggle concentrating on TV series these days, and very rarely do I become gripped on a series, but couldn't stop watching this. Thanks.",literal
"Glad I caught this one! Minor spoiler I was just flipping through the channels the other day, and my mother walked in and told me to go back. SO glad I did. I was surprised, because I'm not usually one for older movies, but I liked this one. Granted, it could be kind of corny, but it was sweet.

My one big qualm? The scene at the hospital when they first learn she is blind, and Merrick wanted to go into her room. He is told ""She doesn't want to see you."" Could they have picked a worse phrase? SHE CAN'T SEE HIM!! Of course she won't see him - she's BLIND! I almost fell off the bed laughing with my mom.

But I really did like it, and for a great old love story, I think it's fantastic. Very enjoyable.",literal
MY FIRST 9 STAR REVIEW ... EXCELLENT I thought I had already left a 7 or 8 star review after the first series but something must have told me there was more to come and I was delighted to watch the second ( of many more ) release of one of the finest BRITISH drama series I have seen in a long time . Gary Oldmans BRAVURA PERFORMANCE in the lead role is a mixture of the great Sir Alec Guinnesses portrayal of George Smiley and Alfred Burkes ground breaking detective in Public Eye ( would love to see some repeats of that instead of the usual tripe ) and he is surrounded by an admirably portrayed band of misfits who each perfectly fulfill their varied and essential roles. Reminiscent of some of the best of the BBC productions back in the day when they screened THE REAL TOP GEAR and did not have the timerity to banish STEVE WRIGHT IN THE AFTERNOON from our airwaves . Shame on the BBC AND WELL DONE APPLE ..... PLEASE GIVE US MORE.,literal
"Reminds me of a another time Really like this show, reminds me of shows when I was growing up: no language, no violence (shown) only implies sex, no profanity or cursing. Decent stories and likable characters, ALL of them. Glad to have another show we can watch without grimacing through some part. It's not Will Trent, but it's not a hallmark movie either like someone referred. Never seen the male lead but he is perfectly cast, and really like Kristen in this show, she's a real natural in this role and they have great (believable) chemistry. All the other team at the station are likable too. Not crazy about the restaurant owner character, over the line wacky isn't attractive and the daughter is an irrelevant role to me, maybe she'll go back off to school lol. Hope there are many more seasons.",literal
"cheesy but charming What can I say? This show is cheesy, factually inaccurate, and at times super, super predictable but....... it's incredibly charming. If you enjoyed light crime series from the 80s and 90s you'll love this, if not you'll probably hate it. I've noticed the Psych comparisons and while not as cheesy and not really a buddy show they're not off the mark. While there have been some parts that have made me groan in pain to watch, overall it's delightful. The actors seem to have chemistry that you don't often find in the first season of a show and I find myself really hoping we get to see that grow in many more season to come.",literal
"Season 2 Not Yet Up to Snuff I loved S1! Fun, witty, great character portrayals. And I'm a 71 year old grandmother who grew up with the OG Addams family. My granddaughter turned me on to the current version & we've been looking forward to S2.

I enjoyed the fact that so many of the actors from S1 returned. Always good to see. And I enjoyed the S1 storylines that carried into S2.

My rating is for S2. Particularly the first two episodes. Such a rushed mishmash of storylines. Too much random stuff happening. Specifically - the pointless Pugsley storyline; we definitely could have done without that.

Things settled down some in the 3rd & 4th episodes to get back to the Wednesday character (fabulously portrayed by Jenna Ortega!), thankfully.

This all being said, I remain hopeful that the future episodes get back to, and stay true to, the actual Wednesday focus.",literal
"Lanthimos does it again Yorgos Lanthimos is, indeed, one of the better and more artistic filmmakers working today, making one interesting and unique drama after another. This is very much a highlight of the year and of the director's career.

The actors all do an incredible job, as one would expect from such a stellar cast indeed, and it is a very career defining, sometimes darkly comedic, terrifying and incredible mix of genres. Very beautifully written and paced, very unique. Lots of twists and turns.

The cinematography, cutting and editing is incredible, very beautifully put together indeed, true to his style and tone of the film.

Overall, definitely an incredible and masterful achievement, that is bound for awards. A must-see for any lover of film and fans of the director!",literal
"A cartoon look at social climbing in 1960's Miami. Colorful sets and costumes, the cast and story is a vehicle for brightly colored and audacious outfits in a 50's - 60's style. The plot is fit for a soap opera, but the over the top acting makes it ok - as long as you don't take it seriously.

I'd call it silly fun. Don't expect anything more and you might enjoy it.

Kristen Wiig plays her usual slightly ditzy, exuberant, character with everything she has. If you've seen her before, you'll recognize Maxine.

"Quality acting/production, very subpar writing,Beth almost ruins the show The show looks great. The actors also, Costner has a knack for playing such tough as leather, hard and brooding character yet is just and good inside. Others actors also do a good job.

The problem is with the writing. Its childish and onedimensional, and incredibly forced, constantly artificially making infantile conflicts.

Like Kayce's wife. Kayce, a great dad who would do anything for her and kid but first she leaves him for absurd reasons (out of his control). On top of that, she constantly torments him and is running him through hoops. Not to mention, she sulks throughout THE WHOLE show. Nothing but complain, is moody and a total Btch...

The same Beth. Nothing but childing sarcasm,insults and being a brat. The most illogical thing her (and EVERYBODY else) tormenting and being hard on Jaime. Who is ironically the most loyal and dedicated of the whole family. He literally went to law school because his dad asked him and protects the family 24/7. While Kayce doesnt want anything to do with the ranch and Beth only comes home if she feels like it. And they insult him all the time. He then makes ONE mistake,which is 100% understandable after a lifetime of bullying and telling him hes worthless, despite he dedicated his whole life to his family, and they want to kill him. Beth the brat especially, who did nothing but run away from home and comes back every few years...

Makes ZERO sense. Who TF writes this nonsense. And in general, every character has issues and conflicts with everybody. Nobody talks to anyone and resolves matter. All they do is scheme and fight. Or stupid things that the writers forget or think the viewers are too stupid to notice. Like when John says goodbye, writers the letter and even says to his family ""this is gonna be the end of us"" and how hes not coming back. What happens? Nothing. They just put that in for drama, the cheapest possible plot point. Or how they ride in into a compound defended by PROFESSIONAL militia and ex soldiers with vests,nightvision/thermal vision etc... And Rip just rides in on his horse and with a shotgun in the middle of it with John on his side and NOBODY hits them, despite being in the open with light in their eyes and the enemy being professionals with obstacles to protect them. And nevermind that Rip and John and everybody else hit every single enemy target. So so stupid. And so on and on.

This could be a great show, has great actors and premise but sadly has the worst and most childish writers in hollywood who know nothing about writing good stories and realistic conflicts.",figurative
"Fallout Super good series about the fallout games. The Fallout series is revered for several reasons, captivating players with its immersive post-apocalyptic world, compelling storytelling, intricate lore, and versatile gameplay mechanics. At its core, Fallout offers a unique blend of exploration, decision-making, and role-playing elements that create an unforgettable gaming experience.

One of the key draws of the Fallout series is its meticulously crafted post-apocalyptic setting. Set in a retro-futuristic world devastated by nuclear war, the games transport players to a desolate landscape filled with crumbling cities, radioactive wastelands, and mutated creatures. The attention to detail in depicting this world is remarkable, from the rusted remnants of civilization to the hauntingly beautiful landscapes that evoke a sense of both awe and dread. Exploring this world feels like embarking on a journey of discovery, with each location offering its own story to uncover and secrets to reveal.

However, what truly sets the Fallout series apart is its focus on player choice and consequence. Throughout the games, players are faced with a multitude of decisions that can shape the world around them, from choosing whether to help or hinder various factions to deciding the fate of entire settlements. These choices not only impact the immediate outcome of quests but also have far-reaching consequences that can influence the course of the game's narrative. This freedom to carve out your own path and see the repercussions of your actions is incredibly empowering and adds a layer of depth to the gameplay that few other series can match.

Moreover, the Fallout series is renowned for its rich lore and storytelling.

"I was a bit drunk but it touched this millennial heart 2003 was 22 years ago!?? I guess I need to accept that now, but this movie helped me. And it so perfectly wed nostalgia with such modern congenial joy, that I don't mind!

The body swapping was a bit confusing half a bottle in, but I still mostly kept the characters straight, and you couldn't help having fun seeing the cast have such fun and committing so much to playing each other!

Curtis shines as always, and Lohan's return is iconic! It's a film built on nostalgia, with a script that is more thought out and complex than it needs to be, resulting in just a darn good time! It's for any nostalgic 00s Disney lover, or anyone who can relate to generational divides and the challenges of growing older in this day and age - so probably anyone!",figurative
"Rebirth, Reuse, Recycle It's rare I see films on their opening day, opening weekend is relatively common but - as I'm otherwise engaged this weekend, I decided to see ""Jurassic World Rebirth"" on a Wednesday evening. I wish I could say it was because of enthusiasm for the series, but that has largely been beaten out of me at this point. I wish I could say that Rebirth was a film that reignited my love of the franchise but, whilst it's fine, it's largely another retread.

Dinosaurs have proven ill adjusted to the climate of most modern countries, with those that have survived clustering around the equator. Martin Krebs (Rupert Friend) representative of ParkerGenix believes that genetic material from three live dinosaurs will help with the research into heart disease that his company are planning. He hires Zora Bennett (Scarlett Johannson) and Henry Loomis (Jonathan Bailey) as lead and scientific expert of his expedition, and they head to the island of Ile Saint-Hubert. But the island was InGen's genetics experiment hub, abandoned following an incident years earlier.

To stress, I didn't think that ""Rebirth"" was a bad film. I thought the central performances were good and I liked the chemistry between Johansson and Bailey and the endless charisma of Mahershala Ali. I thought the film looked really good Gareth Edwards is a great visual film maker and has plenty of experience with large scale creatures.

The problem is that it's essentially 'another' Jurassic movie and feels like its plot is cribbed almost entirely from existing elements of the series. The stranded family from ""Jurassic World 3"", the experts from ""Lost World"", the really dangerous 'final boss' creature from ""World"" - with a nod towards the jails underneath Jabba's palace.

Without any sort of new angle the word I kept coming back to when thinking about the film was 'inessential' and, once again whilst this was fine, I do feel like the whole franchise could benefit from a lengthy break.",literal
"So much potential. I love shows set in this type of surrounding. Alaska is such a Wonderland and a place that I would love to visit at some point in my life. The premise for the show itself is good and very interesting. The execution though, very lazy. The wife, she lives in Alaska, her husband is a US marshal, but yet she does not know how to take the safety off of a handgun? She points the gun and lets him walk towards her and snatch the gun away? After he has abducted her? Come on. Lastly, if this guy survives the fall off of that cliff, I'm done. I can only suspend my belief for so much before it's just ridiculous.",literal
"It's OK. I don't understand the rave reviews. It's hard to be too down on this movie. There isn't really anything *wrong* with it, it's just that this premise can only do so much for you. It's a modestly-budgeted, well-acted piece with occasionally good writing, so I applaud it for what it is.

I'm kept at arm's length by a few things. First, the exposition sets up that this really is just the Hunger Games but for boys (the Francis Lawrence connection adds to this too), and while I know the book obviously pre-dates the Hunger Games, all these things feel like a copy of a copy of a copy by now. It's a little (a lot) played out. In this universe the Long Walk has been an annual televised event for 19 years, and yet the participants are approaching this as if they are unfamiliar with what it entails. They are shocked when the first guy who fails is killed; what were they expecting? Nobody could glean any sort of strategy by watching past Walks? It reminded me of the History Channel survival reality show Alone, where participants are often close studies of past seasons, and therefore contestants in later seasons last much longer, build better shelters, have more efficient strategies for finding food, etc., than those from earlier seasons. If I'm socially/legally compelled to sign up for the Long Walk, like these guys, I would show up to this life or death event prepared and well-informed and with a plan.

The structure is another thing. Because the entire movie is just the guys walking, filmed mostly in head-on dialogue shots, a lot of it blends together and can feel like one very long scene. For lack of a better term, this movie feels like TV. So when the plot demands that walkers drop out and be executed, the script just has one of them come over to talk about why it's their turn to quit. Then they say goodbye, get their three warnings and are shot in the background. One after another. It moves along like a metronome. This is all in contrast with one of the more effective scenes when we as the viewer, focused on our point of view characters, actually weren't sure what was happening behind them or how many guys were being killed (or who).

The ending made a sort of emotional sense but it was so abrupt that I really want more from it.",literal
"Fun, interesting mysteries but nothing special. This is a remake of a French series. The premise is a screw up super intelligent woman becomes a detective consultant. The original has a way better genius. There she is more of a mess. She can't keep a job at anything because well, she is a lot. She is authentic. In this American version she is more functional and well behaving. Boring. Seeing the original makes watching this worse. That being said, the American version is way more watchable, French version has too many boring moments and dialogue.

All mysteries are interesting. Her partner is interesting multidimensional person and their chemistry is a big part what makes this work. Good fun.",literal
"One of the best movies of 2013 As someone who enjoys trying to figure out what's coming next 'Now You See Me' was incredibly entertaining. Perhaps you'll fare better in terms of whether or not you can guess what's happening but regardless it should be a fun exercise.

Aside from that the performances were all really good. The director had a nice pace in terms of have things progressed and there didn't appear to be any parts of the movie where certain scenes were clearly sped up (a personal pet peeve of mine).

I was able to see a pre-screening for the movie so there could be some bias in my review (free movie helps, right?) but I am planning on going to see it later today so I obviously don't mind paying full price to watch it again. That and I've pretty much told everyone I know that they should see it in the nicest way possible in order to keep expectations reasonable.

Definitely recommend you to go see it because it's a fun movie/experience :-)",literal
"Masks anyone? Love this show and the format. Each hour takes you thru one hour of real time in the ER hence, 15 episodes is one day in the ER. Wish our ER worked this quickly. My main concern was that not one medical person is wearing a MASK! What seems like reality is lost when there are no masks or gloves in some instances. It boggles the mind with all the disease and bacteria running rampant and doing minor/major preps and surgeries there is no mask to be worn on any Dr., nurse, aid, etc. Or the use of sanitizers on the wall before entering the patient units. Just going to my dr.'s office it's suggested I wear a mask. WTF!",literal
"Love this show! Everything is so excellent about it. Ever since, my mom showed me this show, I fell in love with all the characters, especially with Olivia Benson, and Casey Novak. But all the other characters like Munich, Tutola, and Elliot, are all amazing! SVU, reveals not only the victim, and the criminals but also the problems, that the characters have to face, and consider. As well, the problems, with child molestation and Sexual abuse, is faced in this world today.

My favorite character Olivia Benson shows so much depth, about reaching out to the victims, and trying to find her owns reason, makes me feel like I want to be her. I also love it how she can touch the victims, with such caring words. If Mariska Haritigay were to leave, I won't watch SVU anymore, without her, it wouldn't be Law and Order: SVU. The same with Casey Novak, she will do anything to help the victims. But after she left...I was soooo upset that she left.",literal

"CU Film Critic takes on ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas."" I've seen far many, many reviews of `Dr. Seuss' How the The Grinch Stole Christmas' in which critics can't resist the urge to write in rhyme, and every last one I've read irritates me.  Yet, as I sit to begin my review, I feel the uncontrollable urge to begin rhyming myself. I promise not to.

I remember being excited to hear that there would be a live action version of `The Grinch' starring Jim Carrey, and I also remember being disturbed to hear that it would be directed by Ron `Opie' Howard.  I had hoping for an artistic genius such as Tim Burton or a holiday entertainment luminary like John Hughes.  Oddly, Opie pulled this one off.

If you want to see a good, fun holiday movie, go see this one.  I'm not going to start comparing it to the classic animated `Grinch,' but I think it did a noteworthy job of giving some back story on the Grinch's character and a little history on the town of Whoville.

It also attempted to answer some age old questions- most notably, `Where is Whoville?'  Well, the movie begins by showing, visually, that Whoville exists deep inside a tiny snowflake.  The only problem with this is that the rest of the film goes on to prove that Whoville is actually located in northern Minnesota.

I've noticed that Jim Carrey is a lot more fun to watch when he talks like Jimmy Stweart on crack.  Honestly, I don't think anyone else could have pulled off such a classic character.  Carrey's Grinch could be the standard by which we measure all other bastardized Hollywood versions of cherished childhood memories.

`The Grinch' is packed with Ron Howard's `in-jokes' and double entendres aimed at disillusioned Gen-Xers.  Seuss purists may find this distasteful, but honestly, why spend millions of dollars on a big-budget remake if you're just going to rehash the same material?

Cindy Lou who had gigantic teeth and gigantic hair.  She also sang a nice little tune.  Let's move on.

The film's talent award goes to the dog.  If anyone truly lived up to the persona given them in the original Seuss drawings, it was Max.  Some may argue that Carrey's performance was more admirable.  To those people, I say, `but the dog was cute and had an antler on his head for a good portion of the movie.  Did Jim Carrey even attempt this feat?  I think not.'

Let's look at `The Grinch' by the numbers.  The props department provided 1,938 candy canes, 152,000 pounds of crushed marble (used for fake snow), 8,200 christmas tree ornaments, and no less than two million linear feet of styrofoam to build the city of Whoville itself.  Opie got the studio to go all out financially, and it shows.  The sets look like you'd expect Whoville to look.  Great stuff.

`The Grinch' gets a `B+.'  It won't by any means replace its predecessor as a holiday classic, but you'll leave the theater feeling like a six-year old.",literal
"A Need Fulfilled I am writing this because according to the IMDB User Ratings, I have not commented. I have reviewed all the individual episodes, but not the show as a whole. There is little that I can add to the impact of this show. I am proud to be on the same planet as those who created and put this work into fruition. When one looks at the technical accomplishments and the multiple plot strains that have been kept in balance, it is truly a wonder. I know that there are those who can never get past the ""book did this"" and ""the book did that."" We have to come to realize that it is impossible to recreate every nuance that fiction allows and that occasionally characters must be dropped and events assumed. For me, I have approached these as the artistic creations they are--as film (and television, at that). I have the books. I've not read them but plan to at some point. I doubt at this late stage of my life there will ever be another series to match this. I like fantasy but am not ruled by it as a genre. But this is for us all. If you've not seen it, treat yourself.",figurative
"Yorgos is Alien, and This is Abduction My hair hurts from all the head-scratching while watching Bugonia. It's like a joke that's really funny for the first few seconds, but then it keeps going and is given length, detail, drama, then plot twist - conspiracies are real and humanity is doomed. To be fair, it became quite apparent at start that the movie is a pulp fiction, hence any attempt at comprehending the story is futile because you can't make sense of a nonsense. This is not to say that the work has no worth - take Quentin - but you gotta entertain the audience in ways other than moralizing. Charisma of the actors and tension of the dialogues are what kept me going until the third act, yet my last hopes were bombarded by the total chaos of an ending featuring the absolute abandonment of logical, emotional, and storytelling principles. There's no crime in the lack of substance, the attempt to render it undeserved virtue is.

I recommend if you love Emma Stone and Jesse Plemons as much as Yorgos Lanthimos.",literal
"Really great period mystery. Really fun mystery that brings to life a long ago class war that still creates chaos for people ending up in gentrified swampland that is Florida. Some other reviewers were whining that this is confounding them if this series is a comedy or a drama when it's got components of both: but it's a mystery, a whodunnit that keeps you guessing. Not all the characters are good people but they're not the heroes you wanted but the heroes the story needed. The actors are amazing. The costumes are impeccable. The way that the society was back then is depicted concisely. If you're wanting something heavy and grim this is not the mystery series for you. If you want a fun mystery set as a historical piece that evokes the incredible Mr Ripley then this show is great. I'm loving this series. I want to see how it plays out. This is a fun cast. And I cannot respect anyone monstrous enough to criticize a project that carol Burnett is in.",figurative
"Love is easy, figure it out is so hard I'm not sure I should give a 9/10 or 10/10, but just 9/10 for now... It TOUCHED me, I'm serious, it made me feel something when I watched this movie, something in my heart. ""Why you love me?"" People keep finding a reason of why they are fall in love, a reason is a material, maybe rich, fit, young or height, people do the math to figure it out they are match, but match isn't love. When someday, the reason is not here anymore -- not rich anymore, not fit anymore or not young anymore, then you finally figured it out that you don't love her/him from the start -- We are MATERIALISTS. Love is a business, is a deal, but it shouldn't be. You know you will divorce, but why people still want to marry? Because people don't want to be alone, they know they deserve be loved by someone, they knew their love should be celebrated, they should have someone can call on the phone. But if we love someone without a reason -- a material, would that makes a relationship long-lasting? I don't know, but time will tell the truth, it has risks, would you gonna take it?",literal
"I laughed and cried a lot: a true gem !!! ""A Man on the Inside"" is a beautiful and deeply human show that left me both laughing and reflecting. Ted Danson delivers a stunning performance as Charles, a retired professor turned undercover informant in a retirement home. The series balances humor and heart as it explores loneliness in the elderly, the struggles of dementia, and the surprising bonds formed in unexpected places. The comedic moments never overshadow the poignant portrayal of aging, making it feel authentic and relatable. With its mix of wit, warmth, and humanity, this show is a gem that reminds us of the power of connection, even in life's later chapters.",figurative
"Another great run for FX The mystery is not too much of a head scratcher, pretty basic when all's said and done. But the development of Lee, and the fun of events unfolding for him is where it excels. Supporting cast is excellent, especially Killer Mike in the limited glimpses we get of him. No phoned in performances here at all, always wonderful to see Keith David in front of the camera. Everything ties up quite nicely, and even surprisingly for some of the characters. Nearly everyone got what they deserved in the end, with nobody getting off too lightly or too harshly. Pretty satisfying ending for all involved, but was such a fun ride I truly hope we can see another Lee Raybon adventure in the future if Sterlin Harjo can pen another story as enjoyable as this.",literal

"Just lighten-up and take a taste... This is the perfect show for Kaitlin Olson. She has managed to continue in shows that reflect her brand of 'Kaitlin Olson'. This show is witty and fast paced with lots of twists to keeps you thinking forward. Ah-Hah moments abound along with quirky comedic slights to keep all of you interested. I think Kaitlin decides the wardrobe for Kaitlin and her characters. Totally familiar if you've followed her... and it works here. Expect comical asides during every episode. Sassy, sexy, sobering and simple. Most of all, this sow is entertaining in a real life way. Her support cast is excellent. This show deserves a few minutes of your time. I'm SOLD!",literal
PERFECT NOSTALGIA I still have the same feeling as when I watched the first film. It's funny and I was definitely entertained.

It's so much fun to see this film from different perspectives: Gen Z vs Millennials vs Boomers .LOL .. love it!,literal
"Strange but intriguing Director Ari Astor enjoys making movies that people talk about, sometimes years after their theatrical release. His movies are also depressing, pessimistic, thought-provoking, and wild. So far, he has made HEREDITARY, MIDSOMMAR, and BEAU IS AFRAID. His fourth movie under the A24 banner is called EDDINGTON, his most thought-provoking and divisive movie yet. This dark comedy tells the story of a fictional town called Eddington, New Mexico during the pandemic, the summer of 2020. Sheriff Joe Cross (Joaquin Phoenix) has asthma and is in an uncomfortable marriage with Louise (Emma Stone), who makes strange sculptures. They also live with her mother Dawn (Deirdre O'Connell), who is glued to social media. Joe finds contention in being forced to wear a mask, which leads to him running for mayor, against current mayor Ted Garcia (Pedro Pascal). This movie says a LOT, but after everything that happens, I failed to see the point of it. I understand that Astor very obviously wants the audience to feel the same feelings that were already felt by everybody back then, but why would we want to feel anxious, possibly hypocritical, and extremely divisive again? I don't think the message of this movie needed to be told so blatantly, especially at almost 150 minutes. EDDINGTON is about so many things: COVID, Black Lives Matter, social media, A. I, religious cults, and conspiracy theories. Quite a few of these things feel tacked on, not contributing to the main plot at all. This movie makes fun of the crazies on the right and the left side of the political spectrum. The first half is a little tedious, but it's a slow burn that really escalates. It has flawed characters and a messy script. The first half is a little tedious, but it builds up to something at least interesting. The cast does a phenomenal job with what they've been given, even though some of them needed more to do. I like movies that make you feel something, whether that's good or bad or mad. A24 might need to pull the reigns a little bit on Aster, but I can't deny his intriguing talent. He's able to capture the atmosphere and overwhelming uncertainty of 2020. I don't want to think about ""the COVID era"", much less watch a movie about it, but if anybody can take a crazy time and somehow amp up the crazy, it would be Ari. EDDINGTON is a divisive movie about a divisive society in a divisive time, and I know people are going to talk about this one, divisively.",literal
"Very Overhyped If you're a PTA fan, definitely go watch this! If not, be prepared for a 2.5hr snooze fest. It does have a solid plot with an amazing villain, but that's about it. The characters that are supposed to be our heroes are not trustworthy and have motives I couldn't get behind. Overall, it was a beautiful film that I'll probably never see again.",literal
"Questions answered and what to love about this movie Despite all the nasty reviews it has received, I believe Now You See Me is one of the best movies ever, I watched it 7 times in 3 days and the thrill was never taken away, I just caught more of the plot. Who says in that it is impossible to re-watch, obviously they haven't tried it. People may say that there are some big plot holes, but I can fill in those because remember the closer you think you are, the less you actually see. explanation #1:spoiler: People say they tried so hard to steer the viewers away from guessing Dylan was behind it all and it fell apart, untrue, they give many big hints maybe not obvious ones but still. Merrit says he has big daddy issues, he gets protective, he fails from the start, he knows less than he should, he is dismissive about all magic, but pays really close attention to the parts about Lionel Shrike. #2:the eye, people say the movie would be better without it, but then what would their motivation be? They want to be great magicians and the way to get in as Alma explains is to blindly follow a chain of commands...#3 carousel ending, they said how Lionel Shrike performed his famous card in the tree trick with a man who worked at a carousel.#4Thaddeus Bradley framed, he debunked Dylan's father, which led to him doing the safe trick which led to his death so Dylan wanted to avenge his dad.#5 lack of character build up, false because it shows changes throughout, Jack, a kid, a con, he's scared, he's tired of being unappreciated, then he gets his big moment and he dies, but really he pulled off the whole end heist and finally changed like the card death symbolizes for ex. and there are many more things you probably missed by looking too closely, look at the big picture next time because the more you think you see, the easier it is to fool you.",literal
"Must see TV This HBO drama series is centred on New Jersey crime boss Tony Soprano. Over the course of six seasons we see the criminal activities he, and his associates are involved in; his home life with his wife and two children and the sessions he has with psychiatrist Dr Jennifer Melfi. While many characters appear in all six seasons many change; some new characters are introduced and rise in prominence; others leave... usually following a violent death. While crime is an important part of the story it is more a character study of the characters; their motives, concerns and frequently paranoia.

I really enjoyed this series, both when it first aired and watching it again on DVD, without inter-season gaps. It is a modern classic which helps prove that when done properly a TV series can match the best films. It won't be for everybody thanks to the violence, strong language and occasional nudity... not to mention the fact that most characters are either criminal or somehow complicit in their activities. However if you don't mind this it is a must see. The characters are great; many are sympathetic despite being 'bad people' or glorifying their crimes and others are easy to really dislike (in a good way). The cast is great; most obviously James Gandolfini, who dominates as Tony Soprano; listing everybody else would take too long but particular standouts are Michael Imperioli, Steven Van Zandt and Tony Sirico, who play fellow gangsters; Edie Falco, Jamie-Lynn Sigler and Robert Iler, as his wife and children and Lorraine Bracco who plays Dr Melfi. I don't know anything about the real north of New Jersey where this is set but this certainly feels like a real location with deep characters and a sense of the community they live in. Overall I'd say do yourself a favour and watch this great show.",literal
"Seems to be Getting Better as It Goes Along.... I thought Showtime's new series""Nurse Jackie"" started off with good intentions and held promise but truth be known, I had little faith in it. It felt like a vehicle for its star, Edie Falco and though I respect her work, I couldn't understand how she could allow herself to get involved with a show that felt a little half baked.

Now a little over a month since its premiere, I'm warming up to a lot (but not all) of ""Nurse Jackie"" and it's not just because of Falco. The eccentricities are feeling less forced and more integrated. A lot of the actors are really coming into focus and are more appealing. I particularly like Merritt Wever's Zoey Barkow, a trainee nurse under Falco's seasoned Nurse Jackie. She's soft, likable and sincere without being cloying. She's cute in an unforced way. We root for her through our understanding of being in her shoes more than once (the newbie amongst the vets). Wever gets us on her side subtly without forcing any of her bits. She's a real charmer. Eve Best's Dr O'Hara is another winner. Like a lot of my initial reaction to ""Nurse Jackie"", I thought her character being British was just too much ""odd-ballness"" for one show that seemed to be trying too hard to be offbeat. But like Wever, she's showing shadings in her character without over doing it (i.e. the episode where she saved the twin brother. Her acceptance of the twin's artwork was priceless. She showed that she understood how clueless she was in how to handle the situation but handled it anyway.) And the dinner conversation between her and Zoey was inspired. Her reaction to Zoey's revelation about her father being in prison for manslaughter was priceless and made me laugh out loud. I'm not completely sold on Anna Deavere Smith's Gloria Akalitis but I think I'm getting there. The shrill, office administrator part can be a difficult one to play. It can become one note very quickly. I don't really like her pratfalls such as her being zapped by the taser. They seem beneath her and don't work. On the male side, ""Nurse Jackie"" has been even more of a mixed bag. Haaz Sleiman's 'Mo-Mo' is fine. He's a solid, believable presence. Anyone who has worked with a homosexual man knows that he's getting it right. Peter Facinelli's Dr. Fitch Cooper (or ""Coop"", as he's insisting people call him) is a good, live wire. Unlike Noah Wyle's Dr. John Carter on ""ER"", (who seemed to be falling asleep even as his stories became more and more super melodramatic) ""Coop"" is very much alive and seemingly off kilter. Like Dr. O'Hara, I didn't (and don't) like his supposed tourette syndrome habit of grabbing women when he was stressed as it felt (and feels) too forced. But as a character (and thanks to Facinelli's performance), he's more than one note. I'm not thrilled with the other two male characters in the show: Paul Schulze's Eddie Walzer and Jackie's husband, played by Dominic Fumusa. Schulze's Eddie is the hospital pharmacist who is ""prescribing"" Jackie the drugs (painkillers) that she's seen taking at regular intervals and is having a sexual relationship with. There's something about Jackie's drug habit and her affair that doesn't ring true in the show. Perhaps it looked good on paper, to give Jackie a very specific quirk. But as played, it's feels out of place. Eddie's role is underwritten: we're not sure what Jackie's real feelings are for him: drugs, sex, both? When none of them really seem to be that important to her, his role feels unnecessary. As for her husband, Kevin, Dominic Fumusa is too good looking to be believable. He's a romance novel authors idea of a husband rather than the reality that someone in Jackie's situation would likely be in. He's too much the stay at home father (though he owns a bar), painfully aware of his eldest daughter's anxieties and trying to make Jackie aware of it. I think the writers were trying for a gender role reversal here by having Jackie be the one who is cheating while Kevin is the doting, attentive caregiver but it's not really working. It's not Fumusa's fault (though he's bland) but more Falco's. Falco's Nurse Jackie may well have been envisioned as a depiction of a flawed but human women trying to balance so much in her life that she's resorted to drug use to get through her day. The show as well as the role, has the feel of being workshopped: the actors might have been able to work with the writers in developing all the elements of their respective characters. While that's fine, what one actor thinks might make for an interesting character to play doesn't always project that way to the audience. Nurse Jackie's no slouch. We're with her right from the start. She's strong, committed and human to us and it is immediately apparent. We don't need the additions of obvious flaws like the drug use and the affair to tell us that. All of this is thanks to Falco. With those expressive, yearning eyes, she's got the weary look of someone who's been through (and seen) a lot but still has the time and patience to care even if she's spent.

Watching ""Nurse Jackie"" is like watching a tight rope walker: I'm hoping for the best, that the show will make it across while at the same time, I won't be surprised if it falls apart because the whole show is trying something new and not conventional. For that, we should be thankful. I'm just hoping it does not turn out to be a one season wonder.",figurative
One of the best Adaptation I've seen years As someone who grew up in the era where the video game was popular all I can say is wow this is one of the best adaptations i've seen in a long time because it takes what was successful about the beloved video game and matches it with an original Story and I definitely think all the praise about this show is well deserved plus the cast is really good too and if you are a fan of either the game or the show this is for you and I definitely can't wait for season two I also have a feeling that season two will be bigger better also expands the universe from the video game and I am definitely a fan of dystopian futures.,literal
As commented very gritty and grim This is not always an easy watch in its gritty realisms. Episode 2 was particularly hard hitting for me. I would definitely recommend it if this would be your cup of tea. A very good turn by Jeremy Renner.,literal

Sinners is truly a cinematic masterpiece. The direction, storytelling, performances (give Michael B. Jordan that Oscar), cinematography, and music are all top-tier. Ryan Coogler has officially cemented his place in the horror/vampire genre with something original and unforgettable.

This film is going to be studied in film classes for years-especially that dance sequence. It's visually stunning, haunting, symbolic, and elevates the entire scene without a single line of dialogue.",figurative
"Apple doesn't disappoint with this one. I was skeptical and this show wasn't even on my radar, but after watching the first episode, I was hooked. I binged the next 4 in 2 days. Great show! The acting is superb. The story is interesting. It touches on issues of the day with finesse and doesn't preach. Which is hard to find these days. The casting is pretty perfect. Billy Crudup steals the show. Awesome work, Apple!",figurative
"wow I'm not sure how anyone could not like this show. Its the best show Ive seen in years. Reading the negative reviews I see a pattern of people complaining about unrealistic horsemanship, calfs being born, ect. Ive farmed/ranched my whole life abd none of this even crossed my mind. Its realistic enough for the general viewer and none of that stuff is pertinent to the story unless you are just looking for reasons to not like the series. The story line keeps you on the edge of your seat, you never know whats going to happen next. In fact if I had any complaints it would be that there is too much going on with each character. makes me wonder if they will have enough future material with it all coming at breakneck speed. The scenery, music, acting are all top notch. In the later episodes I like how they are going back in time to show the characters at a younger age and I cant wait to see more of that. This is as good as it gets in my opinion and cant wait for season 2 Hopefully the wait wont be long and there will be more episodes.",literal
"Cast is not spelled with a K All of the women in this show are dynamite, with the exception of Kim. Naomi, Niecy, Tenyana and Glen are amazing actresses. I thought they did a great job with their craft, per usual. Kim fell flat. The acting on her behalf was poor. How are we going to cast someone with a monotone voice and a face so full of Botox and fillers that it can't even move? Her voice and lack of facial expressions make it so very clear that she's acting. Not a believable character at all.

It really is such a shame because I don't hate Kim by any means. I've bought her skims clothing and products and watched KUWTK since it first aired but Kim as a series actress just doesn't work. Kim is better suited doing things that doesn't involve her trying to be relatable because she just isn't a relatable person.

I've watch the first 3 episodes and I'm still not warming up to the poor acting on her behalf. It's a shame because I love shows with this type of narrative.",literal
Just average I took my grand daughters to see this Disney film hoping it would be good. It was just average with forgettable songs and a forgettable hero. They created a reasonable back story but the execution and dialog just lagged. One of my grand daughters fidgeted the entire movie out of boredom. The ending is the only thing that redeemed the movie from total disaster. Disney really should have done better with this film. They seem to have trouble when their not dealing with an already created fairy tale. I will have to say that the animation was stellar as usual which made the lack of story and character engagement the more sad. I guess they might sell a few toys but Moana in not a princess that young girls are going to remember.,literal
"As Brilliant As I Expected Although I'm an Australian living here in Australia, I have a huge passion for the USA and the Navajo Indians. We travel there almost every year. Firstly I read all Longmire Books, then loved the Longmire series. After reading all the Tony Hillerman ones, I love this series as well. Just as expected. Zahn McClaron is an amazing actor, as usual, and the Dark Wind Series with so many gorgeous talented Navajos, I'm in love with it. So glad they did this series.",literal
"Witty but incorrect I liked this show until the episode about the veterinarian. For a show that is based on high intelligence I'm baffled that the writers didn't look into poison dart frogs. As a PDF owner, we know they aren't actually poisonous. They have to EAT a poisonous ant in the jungle in order to excrete poison. They don't do that in the states and instead eat fruit flies rendering their ability to be poisonous.. it leaves a bad taste for the rest of the show. Rather embarrassing really, because using that ""poisonous"" frog wouldn't have killed anyone. Now I'll have to question any of the ""facts"" that are spewed in the writing.",literal
"Good suspense but... I liked the show- nice plot twists and interesting characters. Matthew Rhys goes against type and plays it wonderfully. Claire Danes is a bit of a one trick pony- always on the verge of a tearful breakdown. Enough of the quivering lower lip already.

Fairly typical ""Rich white guy is a villain"" trope, and an FBI agent who's a loser drug addict burglar for the heck of it. Took away from believability. I was a little encouraged that not every couple was biracial. ( I don't know how Netflix got this past the censors with no black male characters- at least not through episode 5) BUT- then of course - Danes's character has to be a lesbian-and a divorced-lesbian-carrying-a- torch to boot. Uggh. Why? It just undermined the whole plot to have her pining for her ""ex-wife"" while she tries to resurrect her writing career with the potential ""book of the decade"" about possibly a privileged murderer. Netflix just can't let the gay/lesbian thing go. It's a shame.",literal
"Not ""One Of The Best"", Not Bad First off, I have never read the book, so I walked in this movie just knowing that my girlfriend wanted to watch it. Though definitely not my type of tension or drama, since I didn't feel much, it's not as bad as some people make it seem. It's an entertaining and sometimes horrifying movie. I had to look away from the projection at times. The flow of the characters feels natural and real, and though predictable, the ending is satisfying. Though I know it's far from the original version by King, this movie made me want to read the book. It's enjoyable, yet I think calling it a masterpiece is a misuse of the word.",figurative
"This is your sign to push play Ok. This is really great. I might have had low expectations because I often judge series (and movies) by its cover (my brain sorted it as an office series without depth, how wrong). This is the first time in forever where I'm left speechless. Often. I was nowhere near predicting the outcome. The cast and the characters are excellent, the sceneography is well thought out, the dialogue is at times both funny and dark. I don't know how they came up with this, but they did. The only reason why I didn't give this 10 stars is because my better half says no one gives a rating of 10 (it's a 10 really).",literal
"Haters gonna hate. Don't let the haters tell you this is a bad show. It's got comedy, heart and football. What else could you ask for? Definite Ted lasso vibes but admittedly not as good.

"Launching A Second Screen Heartthrob Back in the Thirties the first screen adaption of Lloyd C. Douglas's novel Magnificent Obsession was the career breakout film for Robert Taylor. Universal had borrowed Taylor from MGM and cast him as playboy Bob Merrick opposite Irene Dunne. The film made his career.

Though Hudson was already a star because he'd been first billed in some westerns and action films, this second version established Hudson as Universal Pictures romantic star for the next dozen years. This time the break came to one who was under contract to that studio.

Lloyd C. Douglas was a minister turned novelist who specialized in writing romantic stories with a religious tint to them. Even his novel The Robe which was set in biblical times was a romance between a Roman Tribune and the ward of Emperor Tiberius and how Jesus's crucifixion affected the relationship.

Magnificent Obsession is set in modern times. Former medical student Rock Hudson who now wants to live fast, die young, and leave a good looking corpse inadvertently causes the death of a respected physician and later the blinding of his widow, Jane Wyman, in separate incidents.

Under the tutelage of wise old Otto Kruger, Hudson decides to get serious with his life and start being of service to his fellow man. Nowhere apparently can you do better good works than in the medical profession which seems to be what Douglas is saying besides being a minister. 

Douglas Sirk's direction can get some soggy performances from players at times, but it's a tricky bit of business here. In less capable hands Hudson would look like he was stalking Wyman. But that's how good the two of them are. Wyman in fact got an Oscar nomination for Best Actress, but lost to Grace Kelly in The Country Girl.

Hopefully one of these days TCM will show the Robert Taylor-Irene Dunne version of Magnificent Obsession and we can compare the two.

I think this version will definitely stand up under comparison.",literal
"Still a classic Running man is an absolute classic Schwarzenegger film. If you're looking for a smart political sci-fi drama don't worry about catching this one. If you're looking for a dumb political sci-fi action flic oh boy you're in for a treat. In true Schwarzenegger fashion this film is full of cheesy one liners and almost nonstop action. The story is compelling while still keeping things on the lighter side. It still seems like we're only one more bad election from this being our reality. The same people who scrutinize action movies like this are the same people who watch children's movies and criticize them for being ""too childish"". It's campy, it's corny and i absolutely love it.",literal
"Amazing show I got into NCIS only during the past summer but I was so engrossed with the show that I watched it start to finish. It had a rocky start, sure, with the show trying to find its footing and its niche, but it figured out what it wanted to be fast and I find it to be FAR superior to its parent show, JAG. The plots, the characters, the cases, the everything, in this show, makes it great.

NCIS is the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, an actual organization, which investigates the homicides and crimes committed by or against members of the US Navy - i.e. naval civilian officers, navy officers and enlisted, and marine officers and enlisted. They're also very obscure, and hence are seen as the underdog of law enforcement(in the show, anyway) but, of course, as our heroes, they are brilliant. The main character, Leroy Jethro Gibbs, is a former gunnery sergeant Marine sniper with a murky and depressing past (like Bellisario likes to make his characters) and appears to have a consistent team of four characters: Abby Sciuto, the forensics expert, Anthony DiNozzo, the senior field agent, and Timothy McGee, the computer forensics expert and field agent who joined the show as a permanent member in season 2.

Earlier in the show, Kate Todd, played by Sasha Alexander, was also a member of the team and a former member of the Secret Service tasked with protecting the life of the president. Her character ended up being killed in one of the most brilliant story arcs I've seen on TV, and being replaced by Ziva David, a very unique character in terms of law enforcement drama, as she is a Mossad officer - i.e. her training is not investigation, but rather assassination and intelligence gathering.

The show has two very strong aspects to it which really make it stand out from the other generic shows of its kind like CSI. Firstly, the characters are, while somewhat stereotypical in their mold, fully developed and incredibly dynamic. Tony is perhaps the best example of this - when the show started he was a goofy, slightly moronic field agent, and he developed into the professional, trained officer who keeps his sense of humor in check or uses it to his advantage. Relationships between the characters changed dramatically, with Ziva and Tony starting out as small friends and quickly graduating to huge amounts of romantic tension - which of course ends up playing a massive role in the 6th season and ultimately brings the events to their culmination. The second aspect of the show that really makes it unique to me is both the creativity of the individual cases and the amazing nature of the story arcs. The La Grenouille story arc was absolutely brilliant and I could not have foreseen it, and the introduction of Ari and Michael were equally fascinating. In addition to that, the show is not afraid to make some bold choices (for those who have seen the season 2 finale, they know what I'm talking about). Characters can go and come and even with the main ones, there's no certainty. It's the mark of a good television show.

The dark horse of the show, Dr. Mallard, played by famous Scottish actor David McCallum, is probably the most intriguing of these characters. As a body forensics expert he has a strange past that he loves to share but personally, as a medical student, I found the accuracy of his character's work to be fascinating. The autopsy scenes, while grisly, fascinate me because they're quite accurate in their depiction and their protocol.

This show is worth seeing and is a family show; I think it can be watched by more than one generation at a time and is thoroughly enjoyable. 9/10",literal
"Very much Its own Running Man. Set in a dystopia, where the future is in ruins, the only thing is what a lot of people enjoy, is The Running Man, a show where somebody is hunted, and if they survive for 30 days, they win, but so far nobody has survived. Ben Richards (Glen Powell) is struggling; to help his wife and kid, he decides to try the challenge, and if he survives, he wins a big amount of money, But the question is, will he?

Action scenes are pretty fun, almost as good has John Wick. Glen Powell does pretty well, except when he tries to be funny, it comes across like he's trying too hard. Michael Cera does steal scenes, and when he does you feel this movie should be more about him. Some fight scenes are enjoyable, but go into this you know what to expect.",literal
"Honest & non-biased review. Enjoyed it! Was clichéd yet,still had many interesting parts.

Watched all episodes in a couple days,as wanted to see how it ended.

Speaking of how it did finish.. My interpretation is Mae left & came back or she,hypocritically played that scenario in her mind. Either way Toast was there waiting,by the car to leave with someone.

At one point felt Mae killed her partner,to leave with the baby & help the girl escape.

However being Evelyn met her fate or so it seemed,wouldn't staff or academy in general pose a threat no longer to anyone-Like Abbie?

The town itself was based around Evelyn or her version of community & people that once attended the academy,couldn't leave due to a variety of reasons.. Why it finally crumbled,as people came in that didn't fit or play along to her games.

I have seen comments about Mae & although not a perfect actress,she doesn't deserve such criticism.

She was originally more focused,at doing stand-up comedy. Right?

Think her acting style comes scross,like actress Kristen Stewart.. Ackward,certain voice reflection..etc.

On a side note: Enjoy Kristen & her movies,therefore not hating in above comment.

Was interesting Mae had a major part,in the series development.

Actors chosen & acting was nicely done,cinematography also good.

I'm sure parts of the series could of been condensed,however it was decently paced.

Worth checking out if you want a series that concludes,in a season or doesn't leave you on a cliffhanger.",literal
"Don't understand the hype Sisu is a well-produced, beautifully shot B-movie with a generic vengeance plot. I don't object to the occasional guilty pleasure of mindless action flicks.

The problem with Sisu is not that it is so much over the top, but that it relies on its characters making stupid decisions (e.g. The protagonist riding a horse, staying on the road all the time - he is clearly not bound to roads, while his adversaries are) or having unclear motivations (has the protagonist deliberately chosen to be robbed and abused by the Nazis - he rides towards them, then he tries to escape?).

When reviewers compare it to John Wick or Tarantino movies, they overlook that the latter never go too much into the territory where you think the protagonist would absolutely never survive this in the real world. Of course, the gore and action is over the top there too, but with Sisu it is outright ridiculous how the tough Finn survives everything that happens - it is just 100% impossible.

So, after all, the movie is not a waste of time if you like a gory B-Movie around the tough Finn vs. Nazis theme, but any ratings over 6 are way too high, and project more into this movie than it has to offer.",literal
"Interesting and engaging Love all things Sherlock Holmes This is not like other iterations of the story ie: Elementary The character names might be the same, but look different I look forward to the next episode and am hoping this won't get canceled The first episode was character heavy with lots of actors The only thing that was frustrating was trying to figure out who the main, or central characters The case that was featured was interesting and held my attention Since this is a mid-season winter debut, I would love for it to stretch into fall Definitely give this 9/10 stars based on content and previews for the season Excited for the next episode.",literal
"Realization of my childhood dream When I was a kid, even before I came to know about Superman, I had always dreamed about being someone insanely strong enough; who can ""flick off"" enemies without ever getting serious (there was something about obliterating my school too:)).Over the years I have seen a lot of anime and I gotta say OPM stands out in the darkest night even if you bury it as deep as the Mariana Trench. what? Dragon Ball? I've had enough of seeing the same fight situation for about a million times with the mind numbing amount of power-ups.It was fun when I was a kid and became dumb a long time ago.

The spectacular fight scenes, unpredictability that kills off all the familiar cliche's and the epic music by JAM project made me want to scream OOOONNNEEE PUUUUUUUUUNCH!!!!! and then try to lift my car. I would have succeeded too it weren't for the pesky skirting that came off:)

Seriously, this is one anime you just have to watch, no questions asked. It is certainly the epitome of EPIC right next to Naruto.

"Glen Powell is outstanding Glen Powell is outstanding in this brilliant movie. At the start I was on the fence on the acting and thought it might be a bit corny, but within about 20 minutes I was hooked.

I postponed using the toilet until a quieter part came on and I was literally a running man to get back in time to not miss anything too important.

Can't wait to watch the original and read the book now, I've always been a fan of Stephen Kings literature so it's no wonder this movie adaptation would be outstanding, and from reading his 11 word review of the movie I'm so glad he's happy and he believes they have done it justice.

"To the supreme court of Law&Orderland: the reviews here are admissible evidence. Loyal fans are boycotting HDancy ! The people behind a great show give their fans what they want. Remember Friends? So strange for L&O's producers to keep ignoring so many reviews that fans are boycotting Dancy. Do they not want the same people watching anymore?

It was one of the greatest shows ever. But h. Dancy has ruined it as the worst ADA it's ever had. The character's personality is weak, but the performance is also weak. His delivery is very dramatic, sure, but he does not believe in it any more than i do. His eyes are always blank even when his voice and gestures get excited. A sad fraction of McCoy as prosecutor in all aspects, McCoy's passion and integrity make you really root for him to win. It is why people keep coming back for 20 years.

Dancy is so hard to watch, made me stop watching after 20 years. The show should replace dancy asap. Give the show back its backbone. They should have brought back Angie Harmon instead.

And find another Briscoe please ! These smug detectives now dont even come close. No appeal, pun intended.

"Osgood Perkins would do well to rely on clearer writers for his future films, because this one isn't a keeper. Keeper is a new horror film directed by Osgood Perkins, the director of Longlegs and The Monkey.

The couple Liz (Tatiana Maslany) and Malcolm (Rossif Sutherland) go to Malcolm's remote cabin to celebrate their anniversary. When Malcolm has to return to the city for work, Liz remains alone in the cabin and is confronted by a dark force and the location's troubled past.

Unlike his other films, this is one where Osgood Perkins did not co-write the story himself. The story was written by Nick Lepard, for whom this is only his second writing credit. Despite the intriguing start of the mystery, the film lacks further solid buildup and explanation. As a result, the film often comes across as unclear rather than truly suspenseful or entertaining. With more and better explanation, the film could have been much stronger.

Osgood Perkins does manage to capture the film well visually, creating some tension and curiosity, but these are never clearly developed. Because of this, the film feels more confusing than scary. The dark entity remains largely in the shadows or undefined. This works best, because when it does appear on screen, the CGI stands out - feeling strange or unconvincing rather than frightening.

Due to the unclear story, the cast members also don't always come across strongly, because viewers often don't know exactly what they are dealing with or why they are doing what they're doing.",literal
"Decent and enjoyable It was not a bad film and not as scary as expected but with horror films its the anticipation that is nerve wrecking and It had plenty of that. The comedy worked surprisingly well given its morbid nature. It also peaked everyone's interest. If you can get over the obvious flaws such as kids being able to be kidnapped and killed by a clown every 27 years without being found out its a decent film. The kids of this film did a great job and showcased their fear quite well. This is not one of the best adaptations of Stephen King's novels as some of those films (The Shining, Misery etc) were outstanding. Overall decent film.

7.5/10",literal
"Loved it!! This was a great Christmas movie! Lots of funny parts and a great plot. I don't understand the people complaining it's not a good movie. I enjoyed it mostly because it wasn't a typical cheesy Christmas movie.

"Jim Carrey at his best in the Grinch! Ask and Who, there's no place like Whoville around Christmas Day. Yes, every Who down in Whoville likes Christmas a lot, but the Grinch (Jim Carrey), who lived just north of Whoville did not. The Grinch hated Christmas, the whole Christmas season.

It could be because his head wasn't screwed on just right or it could be, perhaps, that his shoes were too tight. But I think the most likely reason of all is that maybe have been that his heart was two sizes to small. Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen) goes and sees who raised the Grinch who talk about the Grinch and say he wasn't a bad Who, he was just different. Cindy gets told the day at school just before the Grinch was last seen again.

Jim Carrey is a hit as the Grinch and even in the serious times in this movie he is hilarious. Carrey I last saw in the movie ""Yes Man"" with Zooey Deschanel which was a movie about a guy who always says no and goes to a seminar about saying yes which changes his life and gives him more possibilities in life than he thought he knew. Momsen is much older now and it's fun to see where the actors or actresses end when you saw them when they were younger. She actually now is currently on the TV show ""Gossip Girl"" as Jennie Humphrey on Monday nights if you wanted to check her out in her role on the show or just see where she is now. This movie also stars Jeffrey Tambor, Christine Baranski, Bill Irwin, Molly Shannon, Clint Howard, Josh Ryan Evans, and Mindy Sterling. This is a good Christmas movie for the whole family to watch.",literal
disappointing Well wasn't the first two episodes rather disappointing ? Can somebody explain to me what all the fuss is about and why some people are giving this show 10/10 ?

"Season 21 is so bad! I'm rating the series overall but dropped some points because the latest season is atrocious.

The cast in this newest season overact to the point of being caricatures. Most of the unknown guest actors are more believable than the main cast. And as most other reviewers have stated, the pounding down your throat of woke culture is so annoying.

I ended up falling asleep while watching this, woke up during the 6th episode. I laughed through the episode, and it's not supposed to be funny. I really like Anthony Anderson in comedies, but as a serious actor he is not good. At one point a man him and his partner were interrogating called them ""boys"", Anderson's character retorts ""Boys? We are men!"" I laughed so hard, it's like Anderson tries to be serious but just can't pull it off.",literal
"Love Morgan's character Morgan Gillory's character is an interesting blend of three iconic characters: 60% Erin Brockovich, 20% Will Hunting, and 20% Sherlock Holmes.

Erin Brockovich, played by Julia Roberts in a movie with the same name, is a hardworking, sassy single mom with strong personality. It provides the foundation for Morgan character.

The Will Hunting character, played by Matt Damon in Good Will Hunting, provides the janitorial background, and extraordinary ability to quickly absorb vast range of knowledge and information.

Finally, the Sherlock Holmes character contributes with astonishing attention to details and the ability to find clues where mere mortals miss.",literal
"Pointless I didn't understand the masturbation, the lip cutting, the horse they ran over, or much else really. This movie wants to be bold and abstract. But it's all over the place and lacks an actual plot. I'm not sure whether half of it even happened. Did she develop postpartum or was she unhinged from the start? We learn absolutely nothing about her before we see her crawling around on her hands and knees, masturbating at every possible opportunity. After an hour we discover she's a writer. By that point it adds nothing to the story. The acting is good but couldn't save it. I was left hoping it would hurry up and end.",literal

(I exclude Sopranos psychology - it does not promise this, and as for The Wire? not even close. The Shield? this was a different league.) I loved 24 but, let me tell you, there's a feel good factor here that 24 could never deliver. I don't care about reality, and I can forgive the PC attempts. However, with these guys, there's still hope for the world. And on a serious note, for me, any positive promotion for fire-fighters is worth the time. Backdraft, Ladder 49, even the UK with London's Burning. For me this does the business. Watch it!...",figurative

"Bad Writing & Too Much AI Writers are very lazy. I can see how they try to mimic Muschietti's duology. The characters are somewhat similar, the premise is recognizable, and the entourage is almost completely the same. Also, that scene on the military base with guys in gas masks is ridiculous. The use of AI, especially in the scenes set on the balcony of an abandoned building, makes the show appear extremely cheap. I have no idea why the rating is so high right now.",literal
"Beyond expectations. Thrilling martial arms mystery drama Absolutely beyond expectations. Jackie Chan's fight scenes are grounded as usual, still using the environment and props around him to create dazzling fight scenes.

Tony Leung brings in a menacing performance, utilizing many personalities and/or individuals (In disguise). He manages the action scenes in a total thrill ride manner, the knife fight scenes with Tony are A grade for sure. I love the camera angles during this fight, especially the over-the-head slam of a thug into a green bench before continuing to stab and slash his way through maybe 50 guys.

The young cast members impress with neat acrobatics and stuntwork.

The story I will not spoil, but many twists and turns are in store, and it's worth numerous watches for the story; it's worth as many watches as you'd like to relive the action and fight scenes.

"Regret Choosing RY The best thing about this film was the theater. Huge barn with ten patrons. I sat shoeless in a recliner chair with a heat button, which will be great this winter. I'm already sick of the male lead Mason Thames. He is in everything and reminds me of a muppet. Allison Williams is a lousy actress. McKenna Grace is obviously a future star biding her time. The supporting characters were interesting, especially Clancy Brown as Hank. Nothing made much sense. The mother/daughter grief period lasted about thirty seconds. You know exactly how Mason and McKenna will end up. I'd seen the trailer ten times and really just wanted to lounge for two and a half hours, when you factor in the 25 minute song and dance before the movie. So the good news is that I discovered a new favorite theater. I'd see subpar films there just to hang out. I just don't want anything this bad. Scenes were so bad that I was howling with laughter and talking to myself. It sounds like Colleen Hoover's It Ends With Us was much better. I saw the wrong CH film. This is one rich woman.",literal

So an alien virus infects everyone on the plant and turns them into a hive mind, and the usual cliche ""(almost) one person unaffected by it"" that, what, is gonna try save the planet? Right, I think i've heard that before once or twice. It is unique in it's own way, but a 9? A 9?!. Sure this is only after watching the first episode, but it definitely looks like everyone's glorifying it because of someone involved with previously highly (over)rated TV show, and not for what it is. What is it you ask? Uh, I don't really know. It's been an hour and I don't see how this has a chance of having a deep and amazing plot. Nice cinematography. Decent acting. Mildly unique setting, some basic humor, but that's it.

Going into this series you can't help but have the bar high, but it's important to suppress expectation given we likely will never get what we got out of Vince and Peter's previous universe ever again. But nonetheless the concept of this show in itself brings you in as well as the minimalist in your face branding.

When i heard of the workings of this series years ago when the placeholder title was 'Wycaro 339' it was probably my most anticipated series sue to it being Vince and Rhea Seehorn spearheading this project. Hearing that the show is being filmed in New Mexico did worry me a bit though. I think it's important to make this show feel brand new and far removed from Vince's previous works, and being in the same location with the lead actress being a pioneer of that universe could lead to confusion. But Vince has always prided himself on never insulting the intelligence of the audience and it should go both ways so i trust his vision of keeping his og crew and sticking with his guns.

With that said, episode 1 blew me away. Yes i had high expectations but i didn't expect to be sold so quickly. The acting was amazing, the pacing wasn't too much, and the show was able to breathe while perfectly introducing you to the universe you're about to dive into. I'm very excited for what's to come, and i hope everyone feels the same.",literal
"Love the show Son and I watched over holidays and we both enjoyed it immensely. Ted is a true gem, the guest stars were all people we knew from past shows and we got to see them again, reminding us how good they are. We binge watched this because the episodes were short which is perfect to keep our interest. There is a great chance for this to continue with so much more fun and games among an aging population. So much information just in the storyline about nursing homes, aging/elderly, grief and loss, friendships and honesty. It has a small tinge of murders in the building but unique in its own way with the mix of young and old in thoughts and technology. This show is a winner for me.",figurative
"The ending actually makes me choke up every time As far as fun kids films go, this is one of the best in my opinion. I enjoyed the characters even if they were campy and behaving in cliche movie ways. Everything about the beast and James Earl Jones role I loved about this movie. And the movie has an unusual but very sweet ending that brings me close to tears every time. I can't really describe why. Just see The Sandlot already if you haven't, it is a classic 90s kids movie!",literal
"Very Creepy , great acting I want to commend Jack Whitehall for his acting in Malice . Having only ever seen and loved him as a comedian I was so surprised to see him in this role. I think he's done a great job , he is so creepy , and the way it is all filmed is very clever . It's so sinister and makes me feel so uneasy I'm having to listen to some comedy after it so I don't get nightmares. Bravo Jack and all the actors in Malice 👏",literal
"John Hughes made this crap? I find it unbelievable that John Hughes, director of comedy classics like Ferris Bueller and The Breakfast Club, actually wrote and directed this piece of junk. There is no justification for this movie; the humor is painfully weak (minus a few scenes namely involving Kelly LeBrock) and the acting terrible, while only at about 1h 20min it felt about half an hour too long. All the crashing, yelling and screaming grew so tedious by the end that I was left wondering why I didn't flick it off half way through. I guess I was expecting something genuinely funny or interesting to happen. I don't think it should matter that I saw this movie 21 years after it came out, because The Breakfast Club and Ferris Bueller's Day Off were superb films made within a year of Weird Science. 

I'm sorry to say this about a Hughes film (obviously set in Chicago, Shermer High School), but avoid this movie at all costs.",literal
"If you hate yourself and hate your precious time then waste time with this show! This is a ridiculous show, no wonder HBO is not performing well as they are continue to allow stupid shows like this. Rachel Sonnet is so annoying, and the writing is so poor.

Everyone, from actors, to writers of this show find some retail jobs as show biz is not for them.

Pro tip for other producer's: Cancel the show and never hire these people involved in this show again.",literal
"Breaking Bad/ ATM / Meth Head/ Surprise Child Episode This is the episode of Breaking Bad where Jessie comforts the Meth Heads that robbed him by going to their house to get the money back and then finds that kid hidden in the back. This is the ""What if Jessie would have taken the kid"" direction with a twist of Sons of Anarchy and a dash of True Detective supernatural essence. Worth a watch. You can tell the creator watched all of the shows. Excellent mosh up of all of them.",literal
"Love it and Billy Bob! Unlike most here, I like the character of the ex-wife and her relationship with Tommy. They are oil and water, they just don't mix. Their scenes are always volatile. But they love each other or at least they are attracted to each other fiercely. I love the dialogue between them.

As far as the relationship between Tommy Norris and his daughter, Ainsley, and the flaunting of her sexuality, she is her mother's daughter. I believe it is realistic, if not ""normal"". Is it healthy? Probably not, she wants her Daddy's attention and she will take it, however she can get it! Tommy Norris has a difficult relationship with both of his children. Cooper is trying to prove that he is as much of a man as his father. Drops out of college to work in the oilfield.

Now that they are back together, who knows just how crazy Angela's and Tommy's relationship will get.",figurative
"More uplift than a cantilever bra Daft potboilers don't come much dafter than this, but it's a Douglas Sirk movie which makes everything alright. Except in this case it doesn't. Based on a sanctimonious novel by the sanctimonious Lloyd C Douglas, (he wrote ""The Robe""), and already filmed in 1935 with Irene Dunne and Robert Taylor, it's got more uplift than a cantilever bra.

Rock Hudson is the arrogant playboy who not only feels responsible for making Jane Wyman a widow but later is directly responsible for the accident in which she loses her sight. To make amends he takes up medicine, becomes a great eye surgeon and restores it. (No, it sin't quite that daft; he had planned to become a doctor before becoming an arrogant playboy). In between times, they fall in love.

Try as I might I can't quite find the redeeming social commentary and critique of American mores that are supposed to lie just below the surface of Sirk's films, (this one isn't too deep). On the plus side Rock Hudson isn't half bad, (I think I am rediscovering him), and, of course, it looks great, (in Sirk's films people live in rooms the size of cathedrals). Nothing in this film matches the best of his later work and even in soap-opera terms this is definitely daytime TV.",figurative
"Very Enjoyable This series revolves around Morgan (Kaitlin Olson), a woman who is the night janitor at LAPD. When she happens to look at a case file, it intrigues her, and she makes some corrections on a murder board. This leads to the realization by the department that she has a talent for perceiving, assimilating and organizing facts, aka evidence. They hire her as a consultant.

Consider her Will Hunting meets Adrian Monk. Like Will, she has an exceptional IQ and an insightful mind. Like Monk, she is bothered by OCD, although not as neurotically as Monk. But she feels that she must reconcile any data that is contradictory (like an itch that needs scratching). She is also very assertive. And though Morgan sometimes feels on the outside of society, she is very empathetic.

I really enjoy this series, though there have been plenty of other police procedurals that have a civilian with unusual talents working with cops. The character of Morgan is fun to watch. And the cases feature interesting solutions.

She also has three children, so she must always balance her work and home lives. The kids are also interesting. In the first episode, her young son actually helps with her case, behind the scenes.",literal
"Weird Just weird and awkward so far...not all that ""fun"". I started watching this because it was touted as the new ""The Office"" type series, but the jokes dont land and feel forced.... The plot is also confusing

Well i hope it get better over time, its just the begining afterall, but the mood is comepletely different.",figurative
"Surprisingly Great 👍 Ok so I wasn't expecting much into this. I thought I was going to get a GW kind of series. But it was ruthless, violent, and vicious... and the storyline was damn good. The acting was good. And people who gave this one star should not be allowed to vote period. I gave it a 10 even though Its worth a solid eight. If you want the true rating on this website you don't look at the 10, you don't look at the 1, you look at the third highest number on this user chart which is 8. That's the true honest rating of this show. I put a 10 because people hating on it giving it a 1 well that has to even out in some way. There's more people that gave it a 10 than a one. And the overall score I believe is Close enough to 7. But worthy of a solid 8. The first episode will surprise you. It's got its sex, blood , and violence. More of a ruthless Robin Hood series then what has been portrayed in the past by Movies and such.",literal
"Japanese Squid Game Same principle. A large sum of money promised to desperate fallen Samurai. They can't withdraw from the game or be killed and only one will prevail.

"Animal Kingdom satisfies you with well written characters, story and memorable heists Animal Kingdom is as addictive as Craig's drug addiction, this is one of those character driven crime dramas that you will be able to binge watch, I certainly did. The story follows the Cody family which is a bunch of criminals who does various of heists, but the show is about the family members and their character arcs. All of the characters have flaws, some have minor ones and others have larger ones. Lots of issues. Perfectly and realistically written. It is based on the 2010 Australian film of the same name by David Michôd, who is executive producer for the series alongside Liz Watts who also produced the movie. So with two producers of the movie working on this show, along with some talented writers and Jonathan Lisco who developed the show, together they created a masterpiece of drama-crime and quality storytelling.

The creators of the show are masters at character development, their characters are realistic and emphatic. Even the most hated characters get likeable through character development, much like Game of Thrones and Sons of Anarchy. The heists are well thought out and entertaining to watch, suspenseful as you'll never know how they will turn out. The heists is among the best of television or film that I have seen, well thought out and simply astonishing. It's also a big part of the show in both carrying the story forward and the characters as its the family's job. The series has great editing and the pacing is fantastic. When the action sequences happen, the pace increases with quick cuts and some magnificent camera angles. Cinematography is amazing. The show is gritty and often dark but the shots, use of natural lightning and sets make is so colorful.

Shawn Hatosy who plays Pope and Ellen Barkin who plays Smurf give award worthy performances in each season, and I gotta say Finn Cole is close to that level as he has the potential to be great and on the same level. But those two steal every scene they are in. The other three family members is Craig, Deran and Baz. They are played fantastically by Ben Robson, Jake Weary and Scott Speedman. The supporting cast and the characters they play all have a huge part in the story and the character arcs, I can't name them all but there's a lot of good performances throughout the show.

Janine ""Smurf"" Cody is the tough matriarch of the family and J's estranged grandmother. Smurf is protective of her family and presents a borderline-incestuous love towards them, she is also intelligent and knows every side of the business. Barry ""Baz"" Blackwell is Smurf's adopted son and leader in the Codys' robberies, he is also a father and husband. Andrew ""Pope"" Cody is the oldest of the siblings and the twin brother to Julia who dies by a OD, Pope is mentally disturbed and unhinged. He reappears after having served three years in Folsom State Prison. Joshua ""J"" Cody is Smurf's grandson who moves in with her and his uncles following the death of his mother, Julia, who was Pope's twin sister. He is 17 years old at the beginning of the show and hasn't met his uncles since he was around four years old. We the viewers get to experience most of what is going on through his perspective as we are too new to the Cody lifestyle of crime. Craig Cody is the middle Cody son, who has a predilection for drugs and extremely risky activities. Deran Cody is the youngest Cody son, a former competitive surfer who is gay. He is also the nicest of the siblings.

Season 1 succeeds in every aspect, introducing the characters and making us care for them, the actors giving energy to their performances and the chemistry between the actors are superb. Character development and world building is on point, the season has everything a crime drama about family should have. It improves a lot after the first season. Season 2 takes all of that character development and slows things down a notch, giving us spectacular character drama and suspenseful story arcs. The new cast members did amazing, and the characters are well written and nice additions to the overall cast. Season 3 does the same, bringing quality drama but a slight difference in writing. But gets better and up to the level we know and come to love after half its season. The new characters that got introduced makes it fresh and enjoyable, actors like Denis Leary, Gil Birmingham and Dichen Lachman. Great actors, and well written characters that they play. It says on IMDB that this is Sohvi Rodriguez second role and just wow, it isn't a big role but she shows so much promise. Season 4 is a great season that continues to develop characters and takes them to new places, quality drama and superb character development. This season adds a new form of storytelling and it's the use of flashbacks to Smurf's early days as a criminal and I was at first unsure how it would turn out but it was a success in my opinion, it showed interesting and untouched stories that actually helped in world building and us learning more of Smurf, Leila Georga did a fantastic job at capturing the character and also giving her own take on the character as it's 40 years before the present time line.

This is my review of the first four seasons, the sixth will be the last and it arrives in 2022. Animal Kingdom for me is a show about the characters and not so much about the heists they do, the show is so rich on its writing that you get immersed into the characters and the city they live in. It's a great show with sky high entertainment value, you'll never be bored with the Cody family.",figurative
"Amazing show I was a huge fan of the music, which seemed to lend the show a lot of its frenetic energy... as well as sense of humor. I usually don't love period shows about rich folks, but this one did include a few storylines around non-wealthy characters. Whoever put together the cinematography and visuals should be proud, the whole series looked fantastic.",literal
"Where's the magic? I liked the first 2 movies, but really didn't care for this one.

Main reason: the script. This was written by writers with a marketing department or producers breathing down their necks. All throughout the movies the events felt unnatural and forced. The original horseman were introduced one by one in an awkward way, new magicians were dragged in to obviously appeal to a younger audience, one horseman wasn't really part of the movie, probably due to agenda conflicts, but made an act de presence in the silliest way, ...

This episode was missing a lot of the chemistry between the cast. As if they were well aware they signed up for a movie with a script that just wasn't good.",literal
"2 Episodes in and loving it !! Minor Spoilers Ahead !! This show offers a realistic view of how rookie police officers deal with their daily routine. As a child raised in a family of law enforcement professionals, this show is the closest representation of how the characters deal with work, colleagues and relationships. The characters in the show seem real and have issues of their own.

Nathan Fillion as the lead is tremendous in his role of Rookie Officer Nolan. He brings his innate charm to the role of a downtrodden man that seeks to find meaning in his life by joining the police force. There is heart in his performances and that becomes the conduit through which the audience can empathize and sympathize with him and the more jaded police officers of the show. His signature brazen attitude is toned down compared to his role in Castle or his Captain Mal from Firefly. In the more somber moments of the show you can see that Officer Nolan has pain in his heart and has been through rough times, but he champions through it. That's where Fillion does his best work.

The rest of the cast also does a great job, but there are the unavoidable stereotypes. The three main actors orbiting Fillion are Richard T. Jones as Sergeant Grey, the sergeant that doesn't like Nolan because he's too old to be a cop, trying to crush his morale in hopes that he will either quit or be a better officer for it. His performance is solid and the chemistry between him and Fillion is palpable. The little side-eyes and moments of silence are awkward but fun to watch as you root for Nolan but also understand Sergeant Grey's viewpoint.

His trainer, officer Bishop played by Afton Williamson, is a tough officer that's overly ambitious and sees Nolan as an opportunity to get to the detective seat faster. She is his anchor in the show, pulling Nolan down to reality. There are glances in the show that are done very expertly and subtly by Williamson, where you as the audience realize that she actually begins to admire and respect Nolan. That humanizes her character and makes her likable.

Melissa O'Neil portrays rookie Lucy Chen, who is romantically involved with Nolan. She is initially presented as a badass rookie that has a take charge attitude. O'Neil is very believable as that character and her chemistry with Fillion is great. However, her chemistry with Eric Winter's character as her trainer, Officer Bradford, is what helps the character stand on her own and not just as the romantic interest. She is constantly challenged and belittled by Bradford who is jaded but sincere in his desire to make her the best officer she can be. I liken his character to that of John C. McGinley's Dr. Cox from Scrubs.

So far this shows sets itself apart from the current ""cop dramas"" on tv. Shows like Magnum PI, Lethal Weapon and NCIS tend to sensationalize how crime fighting is done. The Rookie doesn't shy away from law enforcement lingo and spouting regulations, but it is not done to glamorize how roguish or cool the lead characters are. In fact, Officer Nolan and his fellow rookies learn from each episode what it means to be a better officer.",literal
Specifically reviewing the Ed Gein season So many people have taken to social media slating this season for its inaccuracies whilst completely missing the fact that that's the whole point. Ed Gein has inspired so many boogeyman stories and film characters over the years that his story has become wrapped in fiction. Meaning over time not many people have been able to differentiate between the two! And that's what the show is doing. It's showing you the facts wrapped into the fictitious stories that they've warped into over the years and actually does it incredibly well! I say bravo 👏🏻,literal
"Bugging me Think this is a movie were the professional critics will rate high based on acting.

This might be a successful Oscar vehicle for acting and that changes the equation.

Personally dont think the script really comes together.

Could probably enjoy the first 70% of the movie as a movie. And could enjoy the last 30% as its own movie.

Hard to suggest who should avoid it without spoiling the ending. Tried hard to avoid this.",literal
"That was made by John Hughes? I've always been a fan of John Hughes movies, even the goofy comedies like Vacation. My boyfriend is a fan of that movie so I decided to watch it, even though I was septic. I didn't know it was made by John Hughes when I rented it, and I thought I was going to see just another 80's goofy comedy, which is pretty much what it is in general.

I'm not sure if I liked that movie. I liked the silly story, two geeky teenagers making the perfect woman with their computer who becomes like a big sister to them who gives them advice. It's also so badly made and silly that it can be hilarious for that reason. [ Just watch the scene where they create the girl ]

But sometimes it just seemed like an excuse to give real geeky guys something to dream about. The two main characters aren't even that interesting or funny. One of them is a fun character because he's very shy and scared of people around him, but in my opinion, the other character is extremely annoying. I usually like pointless and goofy movies but I was completely discouraged at the end of this movie when there was an attempt at a love story. I know this movie doesn't take itself seriously, but come on...

I didn't find this movie very funny overall. It just seemed like another sex comedy for teens. It's sort of like a really bad cross between ""American Pie"" and ""Mannequin"". I laughed sometimes, by example, when the two protagonists have bras over their heads, but I don't think anything made me laugh aside from this scene and the general goofy-ness of the movie.

 I'm not going to talk about the acting either. The appeal in a movie like this one is that it's so stupid and badly made that it can be fun to watch. It can be a good addition to your 80's classic comedies collection as well.",literal
Stick a fork in it! This was an amazing show when it had a bigger ensemble cast. Now its less than a handful of regulars?!?!!! Just not as good as it used to be.,literal
"Much closer to ""Fast and Furious"" than to Michael Crichton. Let's face it, this franchise always triumphs despite the criticism.

I think that since the original ""Jurassic Park,"" none of the films have received good reviews, but they always have incredible box office returns.

After the disastrous previous trilogy, where the first part lived off nostalgia and reliving moments, and ""Fallen Kingdom"" and ""Dominion"" were complete narrative disasters, it was obvious we were getting a new film.

On the one hand, there are successes: the casting is excellent, with S. Johansson, M. Ali, and J. Bailey as the main trio. There's great chemistry, and it works well. On the other hand, G. Edwards' direction knows how to work well with blockbusters.

But on the other hand, there are major omissions, a somewhat absurd script that closely mimics ""Jurassic Park 3."" A family, if not, that we know will survive. Few deaths, which I think would have favored the narrative and improved the atmosphere. The CGI, while good, is far from the animatronics we fell in love with. Many sequences are homages/rip-offs that many will enjoy, while others won't.

Overall, I found the film entertaining. I think they're still exaggerating the hybrids and that the trailers had shown everything, including 100% of the dinosaurs that would appear.

Unfortunately, I think the franchise is closer to ""Fast and Furious"" than to Michael Crichton's books, and that's a shame.",figurative
"Season 1 had the promise of greatness I haven't read the books or played the games, so I came into this show blind. Season one just felt so fresh in the current TV landscape. The action had great choreography, the magic felt impactful and all the characters were intriguing. The narrative felt brutal and medieval with an imaginative fantasy twist. Honestly I couldn't get enough and was so excited for this show.

Season 2 for me was slightly less exciting but having not read the books it didn't offend me, I still had a good time. Although I could see the cracks of formulaic writing starting to creep in.

Season 3 unfortunately just feels like it was handed over to the backup team of writers and actors. Everything feels cheap and generic. They seem to be trying to copy things about other shows (GoT) that they felt were successful there and inject them into this narrative. The casting and acting just feel off in season3 with modern vernacular and sensibilities aplenty. Just really not in keeping with the style displayed in the earlier seasons. I'm not even a Witcher lore fan but that aside I can see why Cavil left. He saw the show becoming a cheap long-runner and didn't want to tarnish his career with it any further. I think I'll stop with the series here as well.

They managed to snatch a failure from the jaws of success with this one.",literal
"Mediocre The only notable aspect of the film is its ability to present events from different characters' perspectives and highlight the details well. Beyond that, it suffers from a generally weak storyline and a poor ending. There are many films with a similar level of writing quality, so this one certainly doesn't rise above mediocrity. 6/10.",literal

"Hatosy gives Barkin an acting lesson in family crime drama. **ATTENTION - A REPOSTING OF A REVIEW FIXING SOME TYPOS AND OMISSIONS ** As an Australian based in Melbourne, I'm familiar with the story of the crime family who inspired the film that this series is based on. I love the film but originally thought the show didn't do it justice. Thankfully, my daughter loves loves the show and I watched it with her. By the end of Season 1 and the start of Season 2 I was hooked! The acting, writing, production values etc., etc. are at least as good as most high profile cable shows - with 2 exceptions: 1 - Shawn Hatosy just smashes it as ""Pope"". His portrayal of a disturbed anti-social with significant prison time under his belt is spot on and proves him to be one of the most underrated Character Actors working today. 2 - Ellen Barkin's portrayal as ""Smurf"", the Cody crime families matriarch is quite possibly the worst acting by an experienced ""name"" actor in a long-term role on a television series that I have ever seen. I won't list the multitude of ways she manages to destroy what could possibly be the shows most interesting character - there's plenty of examples of that smattered throughout other reviews here. It's enough to say her acting has deteriorated to the point that by season 4 it makes the show difficult to watch, which is a shame due to overall quality of the show as a whole. Barkin aside this show portrays the relationships of this dysfunctional family in a realistic manner and it deals with the families criminal activities in an entertaining manner.",literal
Worth a watch. Complex and nuanced characters. Surprising incidents. Unusual setting. Both action and drama. What more do you want in a TV series? I bought the season for $20 from iTunes and am glad I did.,literal
"Charming but hiding character issues under its charm If I hadn't recently watched so many film critic videos, I probably wouldn't even have been able to pinpoint the issue in this show, or perhaps even see it at all, as the main characters and the visual presentation of the show are charming enough to keep your attention away from the flaws. However, once I had become aware of certain flaws, I couldn't unsee them, and that soured the entire experience for me.

The main character, Wednesday, is perfect at everything she does. She is a teenager, but she possesses a set of skills to cover several lifetimes. This is that same old issue as with poorly written main characters in action movies. Main characters need to be vulnerable. They can't be flying kung-fu masters. They need to show emotional weakness from time to time. That is what makes them realistic and believable. If they are blank-faced indestructible intelligent powerhouses, then you can't associate with them or worry for them. And from a logical standpoint, they definitely can't be masters of the universe if they are still teenagers, because they haven't had the time to build a broad skill spectrum.

Wednesday is especially indestructible and undefeatable when compared to the men in the show, many of whom are given the role of either idiots, traitors or just evil doers, and I can't help but fear that modern politics have slithered themselves into this show, which doesn't help with its appeal.

Finally, the writing for the story was disappointing. Wednesday is a detective story. A good detective mystery is one where you can look back at all its twists and turns in the end and see all the pieces fit together, but with this show, the various episodes are fairly independent of one another. The story is bent whichever way needed to facilitate the scenes rather than the other way around. The writers could've made anyone turn out to be the main villain in the end and it wouldn't have made the slightest bit of difference. Furthermore, there are a few times where characters just spout exposition, which is a particular pet peeve of mine.

Having complained about all that, the performance of Jenna Ortega is on the money. She is good at portraying Wednesday's dark charm and intelligence. The other characters are also all sufficiently peculiar and well-acted.

With Tim Burton at the helm, the show looks good. It stays true to the original goth style, while having the modern crispness and, surprisingly for Burton, a lot of colour. Many locations feel light and airy, which contrasts nicely with Wednesday. The academy where Wednesday resides looks both eerie and cozy. The wardrobe has a lot of variety. There is not too much CGI.

In short, this show is primarily an exercise in style. Cute characters do cute things, and everything looks cool and stylish. But that style hides the flaws in the content.",literal
"A film inventive enough that you can bypass its flaws. Now this is a bizarre film. A startling mix of action, historical drama, thriller, horror, fantasy and (most importantly) erotica. It is a film that is hard to categorise and indeed lurches quickly from one to the other, often within the same scene.

Watching this, I suspect my reason for enjoying it so much is that it is charming and inventive. It is a flawed film (something I will elaborate on later) but it is so shameless in its style and story that I can't help but be swept up in it.

The story itself starts out very simply, a Beast (la bete!) is terrorising a region of France so the King sends a taxidermist and knight to the region to capture the beast and bring it back to Paris for examination. The knight, Gregoire de Fronsac brings with him an Indian, Mani. The film soon plunges forward with other tales of incest, political intrigue, assassination and religion at an alarming rate, so fast in fact that some of the more subtle parts of the film don't get the time and the resolution that they deserve.

Some of the actors are extremely familiar, including Vincent Cassell (one of my favourites) as the slimy and creepy Jean-Francois de Morangias, who lost an arm in Africa to a lion. Samuel Le Bihan (Fronsac) and Monica Belluci (Sylvia) are reasonably good but despite the genre blending nature of the film, the characters (among others) are irritatingly under-developed. Whilst each has a reasonable back story, motive and so on, there is little characterisation beyond that.

The director, Christophe Gans appears to be a huge fan of slow motion, the effect coming in often at bizarre and borderline intrusive times. Whilst the action is very entertaining, the fighting scenes in some cases are obviously shoe-horned into the scene with little or no relevance to what is currently going on. 

The film also goes on for a long time and could easily shave off several scenes overall and not lose pacing or characterisation. 

All in all, an odd film. I find it really quite entertaining and inventive, enough that I can overlook the flaws that can be levelled at it.",literal
"Weird It was actually a captivating show besides the long drawn out scenes about the 17 year old daughter character which ruined it. She was overly sexualised by male characters old enough to be her grandfather, talking to her father explicitly about what her and her boyfriend do sexually, and walking around with little clothes on as the camera pans and zooms at her, which was incredibly unrealistic thing for a daughter to do around her father and his friends. It felt like a fantasy for the intended audience of older men who perhaps like to leer at underage women, even their own daughters. Would not recommend for these reasons.",literal
"Good movie I loved the movie, it has good drama and good characters. What is most impressive is the character development, each movement and action are good plus the extras that appear are entertaining, good series 10/10 I loved it. In addition to everything, it is a very, very entertaining action series to watch with family and friends. Me encanta mucho la verdad, Recommended by me, everything in this movie is interesting. I assure you that you will like it and will be entertained a lot. Well, with all this I say goodbye and don't forget to watch the movie. Que está muy pero muy buenaaaaaaaa vamosssssss.",literal
"Comic book movies finally grow up Fantastic Four has always been a big lift. The characters, by design, are a real eclectic cast of archetypes. They finally felt like living, breathing humans and the underlying themes of raising a child in uncertain times struck all the right chords. They're finally making comic book movies for grown ups with mature writing & character sensibilities. I would have loved to see a little slower of a pace and got to spend more time with these characters, but was happy to see a bit of multi-dimensionality for each of them. I also found them very inspiring characterizations. They didn't always have the answers, but they kept trying and fighting. I really loved it and it's my favorite Marvel movie I've seen in a while.",literal
"Not the same as the book - why should it? I have read all the books, both by Tony Hillerman and his daughter Anne and like that this adaptation captures the spirit of the books without attempting the impossible task of re-creating them.

Books and video media are different, different pacing and a different audience.

One thing to remember when criticizing any story - it is FICTION. Plot holes, differences between versions - fine because it is FICTION.

Anne Hillerman herself seems to agree, her books present the main characters differently than her father - and she is not intimidated by the timeline.

Her books ignore the fact that Leaphorn would be long dead, plus Jim Chee and Berbadette Manualito would be retired seniors, not active duty cops.

If it is fine for Anne Hillerman, then ok by me.

If that bothers anyone reading this, stick to non-fiction.",literal
"Not bad, but not good enough I ve seen Jackie's movies since 90's , he was very best at comedy fighting, lot of movies he played, but i dont think this one is the best. He is still ok but not at his best, Leung is better, he is like De Niro, very deep in the character.

Short story, the robbers is consist of young men which has good skills in undercover and fighting. They are very fast. But when they disobey their boss' order, it became an unforgiven mistake. When police has troubled to investigate, they called the retirement officer to help them. It works. With technology and knowledge, the new team got a lead.

Movie goes too long, young character still not mature yet. Not bad but not god enough. If you miss Jackie and Leung, go watch this.",literal
"Wanted to love this! I settled with like! This was entertaining and the Greece scenery was breathtaking! David D. Did a great job as usual in his acting and valor, but the other main character (his enemy) was overly gross and creepy that it came off as disingenuous. A lot of the things he did made no sense at all, even in the end when everything was supposed to come together. The punishment didn't fit the crime. Also, this formula has been done so many times before regarding an ultra wealthy and dysfunctional family, so it didn't feel very fresh. However, the aesthetics and fashion were fun to watch!",literal
"Better than you'd think, but not excellent I think that title sums it up quite well.

Not excellent because, well the premise is ridiculous and it's one of these films where everything goes 100 miles an hour and there's a ton of random, often too random, being thrown in from everywhere, in the image of the very premise itself, totally chaotic and rushed.

But it's good, in that it has some actually funny moments, a pleasant tone overall between silly and fun, it has sentiment, and as obvious as they are there are morals and they're at least well incorporated into the conclusion.

Finally, LeBrock besides being just as beautiful as promoted, makes for a true on screen presence and acted her symbolic role very well. Along with her, there's a sense of metaphor, wildness and truth that transpire from the movie experience. And it should be said the kid who plays the blond-haired Gary was one heck of a find ! One of these 80's cult classics, with its own theme song and all...that manages to cling onto its viewer.",literal
"House of Thinness. A fair approach, when it comes to recommendations with regard, to The House of Guinness (HoG) may be to first separate the wheat from the chaff.

Arguably the prerequisite for writing relevant review on HoG is first addressing the question if the viewer has the ability, totality, disregard anything presented as facts - as on a factual basis ""almost everything"" is wrong. Starting to write a list of all the factual inconsistencies would be a futile exercise as it would become tediously long. HoG is a work of fiction and any reference to ""being inspired by facts"" is about as relevant as stating Star Wars is based on alien sightings. So, if an insightful view of history is part of the rationale for viewing HoG - the best advice would be to give this a wide berth.

Remains the question how HoG works as a, stand alone, work of fiction - is the storytelling compelling and solid enough to warrant several hours of time invested? As ""pure escapism"" HoG works reasonably well. The problem is that HoG, very much, comes across as an attempt to ""use a proven recipe"" without any novel approach.

The problem is, however, twofold; said lack of novelty alongside the sense of HoG, to a large extent, being an inferior copy of earlier work. Once the ""cloak of factuality"" is removed there is little left of substance.

In conclusion; HoG works reasonably well as ""cinematic fast food"" within its style - but it may leave a sense of being spread a little thin. HoG may also leave you with the feeling that you were tricked into watching something that at least gave the impression that there were some historical facts to be had.",literal
"Good animation, but badly paced and strangely written Before I get into my criticisms, I would first of all like to say that I am very happy for Vivienne! Getting an indie adult animated show greenlit must have been actual agony, and I am genuinely glad to have seen this come out. I do hope we can see more shows from indie animation studios become big, as it is something i have a lot of love for.

For background, I have actually followed development of Hazbin Hotel for multiple years; I in fact remember Alastor's original design! I remember when Baxter was a thing, and I remember Angel Dust's brother! I really didn't want to find this show just meh, I genuinely wanted to enjoy it more. I'm not hating the show to hop on the hate train, and I'm not going to glaze it just because I like Vivzie's other work.

Let's do the positives first. The animation is very impressive most of time, and I do find the artstyle enjoyable. The amount of detail that's been animated on some of these characters is incredible, and I can only imagine how much of a nightmare animating the more intensive characters like Husk, Alastor and Pentious must have been. The backgrounds are pretty and appealing to the eye. The voice acting has also been pretty impressive! I thought the new choices were good, and for the most part they worked well across both the speaking and singing segments. Emotions were generally believable, and it was great for a cast with so few voice-acting roles between them. The show got a couple of laughs out of me.

Unfortunately, I do now have to get into the negatives. The pacing is absolutely terrible and unbelievable. There's no sense of time within the first 4-ish episodes, and then in the 5th or 6th episode you're slapped around the face with a revelation that 5 MONTHS HAVE PASSED. So little has actually happened in the plot during this time, that I genuinely thought only a week had passed in the plot. For a show that's allegedly about 'sinner rehabilitation', very little time is actually spent on improvement. I don't find it believable when Angel Dust proves himself to heaven because we haven't really seen him make improvements beforehand. Like sure, he had a song with Husk where they talked about his issues but I don't believe he would have changed that much. He didn't really show any difference in the time between this big character moment and the heaven trial, anyway! I just think it was waaay too rushed, there should have been another episode or 2 where we see Angel Dust starting to change between the Husk song and the Heaven trial.

In the 5th episode, Charlie is freaking out about the hotel not working but... We've barely seen her try anything? All the episodes are so squished together, so lacking for time that I feel like I should be getting whiplash from the amount of info crammed into the episodes, but not a whole lot happens. I've watched episodes 1-6 twice, now, and I'm just... sat here wondering where the rest of the show went? I'm sure part of this is because of how Amazon controlled the episode numbers and length, but that doesn't mean the show gets a free pass. I do feel sorry for the staff that worked on the show, probably crunching majorly to get this out on a shoestring budget, but that doesn't mean I have to pour praise onto the show.

Another negative is the... 'reveals'. I'm sure a lot of people have heard this already, but I didn't really think the Vaggie is an angel reveal hit how it should've. I agree with what other people have said; finding out at the same time that Charlie found out would have been much more emotionally dramatic and interesting. Being told about 5 minutes beforehand, and then revealing it to Charlie again was a strange choice, to say the least. I think a better way to do this, if the writer wanted the audience to know before the other characters knew, would be to reveal Vaggie to the audience alone WAY earlier in the show. That way you could build the tension more, show ways that Vaggie was trying to hide it, seeing Charlie almost find out before the trip to heaven. I think that would've been a lot more interesting than what we got.

I do have a very very slight problem with the humour. A lot of the jokes just do not land. Obviously, humour is absolutely subjective so if you found it funny then more power to you. I'm genuinely glad you could enjoyment in places I didn't! However, a lot of the background jokes were a lot funnier than the up-front, in your face jokes. When I re-watched it with friends, we all laughed more at Niffty constantly throwing herself off the stage than any of jokes you were meant to be paying attention to. The memes about the over-the-top swearing are genuinely real as well, though toned down slightly from the pilot. My friends and I were drinking everytime there was a swear, and we all had to stop drinking halfway through the second episode.

I also think it's... kind of bad as a musical. I'm not gonna claim to be an expert on these things, but it just wasn't believable. The songs are all diegetic, and other characters react to people singing. I think this breaks the illusion, to the point that I can't really suspend my disbelief which is something you REALLY have to take into consideration when writing a musical. A musical has songs when the characters are emotional, and in my opinion a lot of the songs come out of nowhere. I enjoy musicals, but if I'm wondering why the characters are singing at this moment IN A MUSICAL, then maybe it should have been rewritten. I also think a couple of the songs should have been cut so that more story-telling could have been included, as a lot of the songs say nothing that hasn't already been explained in the speaking segment.

Overall, it's alright. If you think it would appeal to you, then it probably would. It's a very love it or hate it show. I think I've simply grown out of the demographic in the years and years I've been watching this project be put together. Genuinely, give it a try, especially if you're passionate about animation. This show does need all the support it can get, to prove that indie animation is worth picking up to big companies.

Edit to add: The very last episode was very good. It was a strong 7 leaning toward an 8 for me, but unfortunately one very good episode cannot drag up the rest of the series for me. The animation is amazing, the humour hits like it was meant to in this one, the songs are the best they've been so far! The Lucifer/Adam fight is especially good, very well laid out and the use of Lucifer's powers in interesting, thoughtful and funny. I actually feel and understand the character's emotions in this one, and the episode is overall enjoyable, with the little hints of side plot being very interesting. It gives me hope for season 2, and I hope they can carry the height of episode 8 through into it. Episode 7 was a little bit nothing-burger though.",literal
"The best of the year After watching many movies this year, by far this is the only movie that has actually left me amazed and entertained. The storyline of the movie flows so well and the action is top-notch, its amazing how jackie chan can still fight, compared to the other movies that has been released in the theaters this is for me in another level, this movie actually has a heart, emotions. Theres a balance of sadness, humour, thrill and action. There are some parts of the story which still needs some tweaking some parts still does not quite make sense but overall its so good compared to the movies released this year in the theaters espescially in the action/thriller category. Most of them just doesnt create this feeling of connection, it feels like theres no heart in the movie. It doesnt have that balance of humour, sadness, thrill and action which this movie shows. This movie also have a combination and adaptation to our age like the use of AI and Technology but it's not used in an overwhelming way. I can say that this is the best movie by far this year.",literal
"an Oscar Contender with Urgent Relevance One Battle After Another"" is a tour-de-force that grips the viewer from its opening scene to its final frame. For a film clocking in at 2 hours and 41 minutes, it is a testament to the editor and director that the extensive run time never registers-the action and drama are ceaselessly compelling. Expect this film to dominate the awards season conversation; the Oscar buzz is absolutely warranted, with every actor delivering a performance worthy of recognition.

The narrative is occasionally marred by bursts of melodramatic folly that nearly push the action into the realm of excess, but the execution is always sharp enough to pull the storytelling back on course.

A more critical lens, however, must be applied to the portrayal of Teana Taylor's character. Her hyper sexualization feels unnecessary and frankly, problematic, invoking a troubling history of colonizer-like fetishism toward Black women that has persisted since pre-antebellum slavery. Given the film's intense political commentary, it is likely this was a deliberate choice intended to underscore a specific, unsettling point about systemic objectification.

Indeed, the film's true brilliance lies in its trenchant critique of the present. It masterfully creates parallels to our current political climate, dissecting issues of corrosive divisiveness, hidden agendas, 'dirty desires' for control, the veiled order of supremacy, and the heroic, ongoing struggle of anti-fascist revolutionaries. ""One Battle After Another"" is more than entertainment-it's a necessary political mirror.",figurative
"Dawson ruins the show Even though I watch every week, I can't help but have to comment on the one main thing that's really gets me about the show - Dawson! I get the these types of prime time shows will have a soap opera aspect to it, but with her it's really irritating. It's all about her. It's not the actress as much as it's the character. If they would tone down that aspect of the show my 6 rating would be an 8, possibly a 9 with a few more tweaks. Still a lesser quality show to PD, especially now that Sophia Bush is gone. It was the same tiresome soap opera with her. However, if you are looking for a solid show(s), the Chicago series is worth checking out, especially the crossovers.",literal

"Very bingeable, entertaining ""soap opera"" in spite of flaws This series featured so many fascinating characters negotiating personal problems during a tumultuous era that I just had to keep watching. Although the individuals were just ""based on"", the producers made an effort to keep the historical settings accurate.

I wish I could have given a higher rating but, as a work of art, as otthers have noted there were flaws.

Many scenes seemed to have been filmed with a green filter over the camera lens. To prove this was Ireland??? Ridiculous! The scenery and cinematography was certainly good enough without the special effect.

Worse, the sound track incorporated modern rock songs along with Irish folk tunes, a device which simply didn't work and, for me, was downright jarring! There were plenty of light, classical works composed during the era which could have been used instead of the rock and roll.

During these, first episodes, the family worked on the many personal problems tfhey had with the world and with each other, maturing during the process, I felt. It ended on a real cliff-hanger! I can't wait for the second season!",literal

"A romantic comedy that enters the best of the year Erin Foster creates one of the most likeable and enjoyable series of 2024 and does so with the originality of a story that works from the first moment with the cunning of knowing how to deliver what the viewer comes looking for when they decide to watch it.

It is supplied by two great protagonists like Kristen Bell and Adam Brody, who fit together perfectly, overflowing with absolute chemistry on screen and the necessary charisma to give us a couple with whom we empathize and believe from their first moments. At the same time, we also find secondary characters who add an extra plus of success such as Justine Lupe, Timothy Simons, Tovah Feldshuh or Jackie Tohn who with their charisma and perfect characters manage to add more fun to the central story and that at times invites in the case of the two brothers of the protagonists to have their own show of how well they build their moments during the series.

It is a fun series that has the right ingredients to provide light and easy-going entertainment, but it does not fall into being simplistic, because it also dares to put interesting topics, perhaps referenced by the creator and her own life experience. The series knows how to take advantage of its originality of the opposite poles, of how much we create and how much we are willing to give for love and when it seems that it gets tangled up in how to solve everything, it intelligently knows how to use the twists to open a new aspect where to captivate.

A nice bet that deserves a chance, that meets the simplicity of a romantic comedy, but offers many more interesting and enjoyable things for a viewer who can watch it with indifference, it is a series that flies by and that perfectly executes the originality of its premise.

Netflix offers a pleasant pastime for this weekend and one of the pleasant surprises of 2024.",literal
"I watched the movie today. It was good, but not amazing The movie is set in the 1960s, and I really liked the retro vibe. The visuals, costumes, and music all felt fresh and different from other Marvel movies. Pedro Pascal did a solid job as Reed Richards, and Vanessa Kirby was great as Sue Storm.

The story was okay, nothing too deep. It felt more like an introduction to the characters than a full, exciting story. There wasn't a strong villain presence either-Galactus didn't feel dangerous at all, and Silver Surfer barely had any screen time.

There were a few fun moments and some nice character scenes, but the pacing was off sometimes. Parts of the film felt slow or a bit disconnected. Not much tension or emotion overall.

In short: it's a decent movie to kick off the new Fantastic Four era, but nothing special. I'm curious to see what comes next, but this one didn't blow me away.",literal
"Worth a watch I watch everything with Toni in it, I don't think I've ever disliked something and was in.

"Decent sequel after all these years Freakier Friday is Disney's 2025 sequel to the beloved Freaky Friday, this time expanding the concept beyond just two people swapping bodies. Alongside returning stars Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis, the cast gets fresh energy with Julia Butters and Sophia Hammonds stepping into the chaos.

Right away, it's clear this is a nostalgia play done right. It captures the charm, warmth, and humor of the original without feeling forced. Where some films shove nostalgia down your throat (I Know What You Did Last Summer reboot, anyone?), Freakier Friday eases it in naturally, honoring the original while delivering something fresh. Instead of just one mother-daughter swap, we now get four characters switching, which multiplies the comedic possibilities and keeps the energy high.

The performances are spot-on. Lindsay and Jamie Lee still have incredible comedic timing, and Julia Butters and Sophia Hammonds hold their own in every scene. Watching them all switch personalities is endlessly entertaining-each actor nails both their own role and the person they're ""inhabiting."" It's a testament to the direction and the cast's chemistry that you can still vividly remember the characters hours after watching.

The script smartly dials down the ""Disney Channel"" vibe in favor of a more theatrical feel, making it work just as well for longtime fans as it does for new viewers. We learn Harper is a surfer with a chill, grounded vibe; Anna is managing a mega pop star; Lily is a guarded but insecure British teen; and the grandmother-still as loving as ever-anchors the family. The movie doesn't just rely on the body-swap gimmick-it actually develops these characters.

One of the film's best touches is its restraint with cameos. Chad Michael Murray returns as Jake, but only for a quick, meaningful moment rather than stealing focus. And when Anna's fiancé Eric breaks into dance, it's the kind of scene that instantly makes you smile.

While this will likely crush on Disney's streaming platform, it's worth catching in theaters if you can. The big-screen energy, the warmth of the story, and the layered performances make it more than just a cash-grab sequel. Freakier Friday feels like a true continuation of the first film-a fresh, fun, heartfelt take that proves Disney still knows how to mix nostalgia with originality.",literal

"Great TV show. I like this one. Great TV show. I like this one. This series focuses on the FBI, promoting potent and efficient law enforcement - as well as gender equality, diversity and good ethical conduct in the FBI. It also tackles some very delicate law enforcement issues, such as PTSD and occupational burnout in the FBI - as well as the proportional use of force by law enforcement agents. Especially in this day and age of violent extremism and mass shootings in the U.S, law enforcement officers are sometimes put in a position where they have to use their firearms to prevent the shooting and killing of innocent civilians. So I think that such progressive TV series should also be made in those other big countries - such as China, India and Russia - where police violence and occupational burnout in law enforcement is a big problem; in the sense that Law Enforcement Management should have no inhibitions of imposing mandatory Psychotherapy and Human Rights Education on law enforcement officers who exhibit unethical behavior and poor judgment in the international community.",literal
"So close but so far... Aside from the fact that 70% of the inmates survived a plane crash with little injuries, barely shivered in the dead of winter wearing just a jumpsuit, the Marshals wife gets kidnapped by the main villain but her Marshall husband seems very undaunted that she's in the care of a psychopath. Then you have his son and gf who are missing as they didn't tell anyone where they were going before the school was in lock down due to convicts being all over the place but the dad didnt seem too concerned about him either. I mean, there are only the vilest of criminals on the lose. He then figured they must have gone to a cabin he recently purchased but for some reason it takes 446 days for a cop to arrive there to check it out. The cop calls the dad and confirms the kids are there by seeing them through a window using binoculars BUT DOESNT go inside to tell them there are escapees all over the place so they better go with him, so he tells the Marshall he will hunker down and wait until morning but i dont know if he actually goes into the cabin as the episode was ending and it ends with a cooler appearing out of nowhere.

"A Sequel That Doesn't Live Up to the Original I rated Nobody 2 6/10 stars, while I rated Nobody 10/10 stars. The sequel is based on a false premise: That he has to go back to being a Spec Ops agent to repay $30M debt to Russian mafia that he burned in Nobody. At the end of the first film, he and his family were free and clear, buying a new house with a new identity. Being able to establish a new identity is one of Hitch's ""special set of skills."" Hutch (Odenkirk) is no longer a reluctant hero. He walks back into fights that he could have walked away from. That breaks his promise to his wife and family that he's not longer a fierce operator, rather just a father and family man again.

The violence is now more cartoonish than realistic. Hutch is no longer a vulnerable Everyman. Now he's an indestructible superhero who seeks out payback. That completely changes the viewer's perception of him as a sympathetic character. Now he's a vengeful man seeking to repay even the slightest offense. The booby traps he sets in the grand finale at a theme park, seem more from the Home Alone playbook, than from an experienced operator's tactics. Overall, the sequel doesn't live up to the original and we're voting for no Nobody 3. 🙁",literal
"Moana? Vaiana? Maui? **** May contain strong spoilers ****

This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....

This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.

In a world... of water and islands... and... in a world of demigods, there lives a girl named Moana. A long time ago, there was an evil force that kept the islanders on the dry land. Suddenly, the heart of the world had kept the secret too long, and there were the chosen one. Does this sound like a fairy tale made by Disney? Well, that is 'cause it is. Moana is a little too sweet, little too deep in the attempt of being cute, funny and amazing. Moana is a good movie. Moana is fun and cute. It could have been a lot better with a more serious matter of conveying the story, the actors and the jokes. This is keeping the movie in the 6,5 barrier instead of jumping up to the good old ""Eight of the great"", speaking of IMDb.

In the late days, the animation movies has begun to shape the appearances of the characters as a little nod to the real actor behind. So in here; Dwayne Johnson shines through and gives Maui (and yes, ""The Rock"" is Samoan ((as Maui)) in real life) a solid voice and atmosphere. It is done with such intensity that ""The Peoples Eyebrow"" is projected onto Maui. The production team also gives the character the little ""narcisisstic touch"" that The Rock so shines with, speaking of his proud and hard muscles. That is both fun and good to watch.

Nice nod to Raiders Of The Lost Ark 41:30 into the movie. Nice nod to The Abyss with the water as a lifeform... see especially at 1:18 into the movie.

...and.... you're welcome.

Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Excellent and fantastic animations. - The actors : They are all animated. Did you miss that? (Dwayne Johnson struggles to keep it simple and believable.) - Entertainment : Yes, it is. Just to see all the nods to Dwayne Johnsons character ""The Rock"" in WWE is funny. All those tattoos.... - Age : 7

6,5 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 7 Well made movie. Proper entertainment. 6 Nice production. Good movie.)",figurative

"Strange, that's for sure...but also very, very good. ""Stranger Things"" is a very big surprise. After all, it's a made for Netflix series, so it's going to be cheap and suck...right?! Well, no...fortunately. Despite having mostly no-name actors and a modest budget, this show turned out to be a hit and one that promises to bring us more episodes. At the time I am writing this, the eighth episode has been aired and the series appears over...or so you think until the very end.

So what is this show? Well, in many ways it's like some Steven King novels (particularly ""Firestarter""), the 1980s and ""Gravity Falls"" all mashed up into one really strange but fascinating show.

The show begins with a child being lost into another dimension and his mother is naturally out of her mind with worry. But soon this sense of panic is felt by many in this small community. In the midst of this, a young girl, who is simply named '11' arrives in the town and is hidden by some middle school boys. They know she's being hunted...but what does she have to do with the disappearance as well as folks seeing monsters?! Well, watch this paranoid show and you'll see.

So why was the show so effective and why are so many folks eagerly awaiting more episodes? Well, the writing is terrific and the direction really keeps you on the edge of your seats. The acting is also surprisingly good and overall the package is well worth seeing and will impress you. Far better than network television.",literal

This series is all of that. Perfect? NO! But good enough to make you want more and more as you watch, never any thought about watching something else. I just finished, rather than say to much, I'll just leave the ending to your imagination and fantasies which gives nothing away. Bon Appetit!",literal
"One Of The Greatest Shows On Earth. ♦ 95% It will stay up there with the greatest shows. Breaking Bad was my first ever exposure to TV series. Then I started The Sopranos and frankly speaking, I was not that impressed with the first 2-3 episodes. Even you may feel bored but that's because of the exposure to the 2000s shows. Give it time and you will see.

Then, the momentum took care of everything. I grew so fond of the characters, the deepness, the large amount of humor and the actual mob story, that I started watching 4-5 episodes a day. After completing Season One, I wanted more. But then I thought I should write why it is one of the greatest shows.

Because it deals with mafia stories. It is original in its own way and maybe the use of humor has something to do with my fondness. The expressions, the phrases, the figures of speech keep me hooked. The arcs of characters are mind-boggling. They strike you at the right chords. After 13 episodes of blissful crime-drama, I can really term it up with the likes of BB. Although BB is a new-age contemporary, The Sopranos was cool in the since the 90s. So if you are into crime TV shows, this is staple and a classic.

BOTTOM LINE: Highly recommended! The characters ought to stay with you for long... But if you are watching it now in the 2014s, there has got to be a sense of boredom because of our exposure to crime contemporaries like Breaking Bad, Dexter, Sherlock, etc..",literal
"Are these people watching the same show? Terrific new Apple show when a lot of them are not. Sure there's Slow Horses and For All Mankind but for each one of those there's several that are tedious and boring having people meander aimlessly forever without much ado. This on the other hand is well paced with some good action, acting and mystery. Nice locales too. Clark ( playing a good guy ) gives his usual solid performance. Bennet, Cooper and Kessel all give good performances too. Too bad all the episodes are not available because this would have been a great binge watch. I've no idea what these reviewers that were watching that put down the show but it must have been something else because this was exciting and entertaining. Judge for yourself.",figurative
"Thrills First, Logic Later The Running Man is an action film that unquestionably knows how to hit the accelerator. When it leans into pure adrenaline - the chases, the hand-to-hand momentum, the blockbuster swagger - it genuinely works. You can feel the filmmakers' intention to deliver a high-octane adaptation that captures the spirit of King's dystopian spectacle.

Glen Powell absolutely commits, and several viewers are right: he ""killed it, literally."" His physicality and charm carry much of the film's early propulsion. Michael Cera and Colman Domingo bring color to the cast, though their screen time is too brief or underutilized to fully land.

However, the film's weaknesses are equally visible.

King's story contains sharp commentary, a kind of vicious satire about media, violence, and society. In this adaptation, much of that bite feels blunted. The screenplay gestures toward deeper commentary but rarely follows through. As a result, the film ends up feeling like a stylized chase movie sitting on top of deeper material it never quite explores.

Critics' concerns about pacing are valid: after an energetic start, the narrative loses steam, and ""becomes a drag, and stays that way"" in the middle stretch. The final act especially feels less epic than anticipated, with logic collapsing under spectacle - a reminder that relentless movement isn't the same as storytelling momentum.

This adaptation delivers spectacle, yes, but misses the emotional and thematic depth needed to elevate it.",literal
"An 80's movie that actually stands the test of time!. Still Brilliant Recently re saw this picture and discovered it's more contemporary now than it was when it was made. 

One Arnold's most underrated films of his heyday. I thought it was really good and stands the test of time.

Out of all Arnold's movies it's the cheesiest. From the Arnold perspective, it tries to be Commando, hitting you with a bombardment of one liners and hoping that they stick, but they don't.

The movie is far less spectacular form something would expect from the Oak in the 80s. It's very cheap and low budget.

The coolest part despite the cheese was seeing Arnold rip through all his enemies as violent as possible. His enemies include Jim Brown, who you could consider the 1970s version of Arnold. 

Overall, watching this movie in this day and age makes me think that the film was ahead of its time. Reality Television today is only a ratings point away from doing the Running man. 

It's a nice little hidden gem",figurative
"Clever Writing This had me transfixed from the very beginning. Kaitlin is perfect for the part, and it's a fun way to see how she figures out various situations. Funny, yet interesting enough to keep one's attention.

Whether this would 'fly' in a real-life situation is debatable, but who knows? My only drawback is the facial hair on Mr. Sunjata. I've always thought him very cute, but now he looks like he's not slept in days. When will this 'fad' end with certain men?

I highly recommend watching this new show; very humorous, yet deeply clever.

Looking forward to the next episodes and hoping they'll be as entertaining as the pilot.",literal
"It's like a crescendo into justice. People who don't think it's good writing, didn't watch the whole thing. It's a slow burn. But wow what an incredible show. I hope it wins all the awards and inspires more people to stand up for what is right in this world.",literal
"Ross Poldark is alive! You don't have to find some mysterious stones to touch to go back in time to the 18th century. Just experience Poldark on a hi-def TV with a good sound system, and you'll BE there. From the stunning Cornwall scenery, to the careful attention to detail in the interior sets and locations, to costumes that range from the ragged to the rich, to the glorious music, and their wonderful choices for casting, especially the brilliant and charismatic Aidan Turner as Ross Poldark, this production has proved to be satisfying for people who have never seen the 70s version or read the novels it is based on, as well as those who have done either or both. 

There is a wonderful balance in how this has been adapted, perhaps because of both male and female influences. The original author of the books, the late Winston Graham, and Debbie Horsfield, who wrote the script, seem to collaborate to create a touching story that has us entirely sympathetic with Ross's plight as he returns to Cornwall, still recovering from his wounds from fighting the war in America, only to find his situation in tatters in more ways than one. Aidan's portrayal gives us a fascinating Ross who is warmer and easier to like than he is in the books, the first of the 12-book saga having been written 70 years ago. By the end of this first series, we care deeply about what happens to him and everyone close to him. The villains are diabolical, of course, excellently played by their respective actors, while the love story between Ross and Demelza, played beautifully by Eleanor Tomlinson, is incredibly compelling. Her story is made all the more captivating by her sad upbringing by a father who mistreats her, but she is saved from all that by Ross, seemingly on a whim. It's one of the most lovely aspects of the series that we see her progress from a penniless urchin to a young woman with at least some education and much good sense. 

This is not a replacement for Downton Abbey, it's an entirely different kind of story, and to me a great deal more exciting, much as I did appreciate Downton. I never tended to watch that show's episodes more than a time or two. I can't say the same about Poldark, a guilty pleasure that seems to never get tiresome no matter how many times I've seen it.

The second season has just concluded, and it proved to be as wonderful and perhaps even more exciting than the first. The plot thickened, there were some new characters, and it was still just as well done. We saw Ross and Demelza have their marriage tested in surprising ways as they struggled through hard times, though with one of the sexiest love scenes I've ever seen. And there is also humor to lighten the story. They wrote some new music for it although they still use music from the first season—all beautiful!

And now we wait for the third season. Hopefully, it won't be as long as it was between the first and second seasons. Enjoy!",literal
"Worst use of a flashforward ever As has been said in another review, you'll know exactly the outcome of the series in the opening scene and that removes all the dramatic tension from the entire series. I kept watching because it was such a stupid opening move that I (wrongly) assumed they'd do something clever and subvert the device but no. It was just a stupid series, that started stupidly and kept on being stupid throughout. At one point a character works out the Manny is a baddie and promptly invites him into his house, alone and closes the door to his home, to common sense and to all credibility. It just kept getting dumber from there. In retrospect I hate watched it. There. I've said it.",literal
"This one gets it ALL correctly... This series is a masterpiece in relevance, production, acting, and writing. Extremely good performances by a broad cast. The writing soars, expertly defining the voice of each character's perspective, and delivering insights that are timely, believable, and poignant. Many perspectives and attitudes about sexual exploitation of workers is cast during first few episodes, and throughout the series justifications and rationales are tested, considered, and dispatched. The finale is best savored, with some of greatest performances; particularly Anniston's-unrivaled in her storied career. Jen draws from decades of learning and self-knowledge to portray a highly visible icon's breakdown and tantrum as she demonstrates what female strength and it's many facets, truly is for all to see; strength to tolerate the ""boy's club"" while finding ways to succeed despite it; strength to stand face-to-face with competition and show no signs of it in the veneer; strength to give-up and back-off when the stakes run too high; and strength to change the unfair rules. Besides Anniston, many other amazing performances are delivered: Witherspoon, Polway, Mbatha, Crudup, Carrell and many more...all are nuanced, expertly delivered, which goes back to the writing: Bravo! Excellent! Well done!",figurative
"Hanako Greensmith has finally come out as gay Once Hanako Greensmith finally came out as gay..instead of trying to force her into relationships with men who obviously never are able to create any kind of realistic response from her on screen..move ahead and find a woman partner that can join the firehouse even if its as clerical staff. Maybe as an open gay actress she can create a more realistic role than she has so far. I think they have often missed opportunities to be a lot more inclusive with their characters.

The other actress I was relieved to.see gone was Gabby. Either she had the WORST writers or the intention always was to.make her the most obnoxious woman alive. Nothing about her made sense..especially her relationship with Matt Casey..real fish out of water stuff there.",literal
"Good show that could be so much better! Ideal premise and great lead in Justin Hartley. This could be a great show but it's spoiled every time the Bruin characters appear! Completely kills any tension that might be building. A real shame.

I still enjoy watching purely for Hartley though - he's got such a great screen presence and it's disappointing he's not been given better movie roles. Could big an even bigger star!

Some really well shot locations in this too, a nice change from the usual city settings in most series.

Would like to see more of a thread throughout the season rather than just the self contained episodes, (in addition to the family history, that is).",figurative
"This show is really, REALLY good! I was ten-years old when the original 'Addams Family' television show first aired. I thought it was funny-but-silly. And then the 'Addams Family' films released in 1991 and 1993 proved to be more of the same, only by then I had long outgrown that kind of humor. For me, this 'Wednesday' series came as a refreshing and pleasant surprise, as it is neither predictable nor silly, and the casting is extraordinarily good! All eight episodes from season one were exceptionally fun to watch. Jenna Ortega is perfectly cast as Wednesday Addams, with Emma Myers playing her cute roommate, Enid Sinclair. I also love Catherine Zeta-Jones and Luis Guzmán as Wednesday's parents, Morticia and Gomez. Wednesday's school, Nevermore Academy, is sort of like Hogwartz school for witches and wizards, complete with a fun cast of characters, including even a Voldemort of sorts. This is an overall excellent series!",literal
"Disappointing even when you're not expecting much I don't think anyone watches a movie like this expecting a masterpiece, but was even below my low expectations for a feel-good Hallmark-esque Christmas movie. The characters are emotionally immature and petty, and you're left with no one to cheer on. On top of that, the acting is terrible. I really wanted to like this movie and have another cozy Christmas movie but this just ain't it.",figurative
"Supporting a Creator, Finding a Great Horror I've watched Chris Stuckmann's reviews for perhaps a decade now, and I've always admired his passion for movies and filmmaking. Seeing him go from YouTube critic to professional filmmaker, I knew I had to support his debut film, Shelby Oaks.

This movie reminded me why you should never fully listen to critics before watching something yourself. I'd seen a few negative takes that made me nervous, but I'm glad I ignored them, because Shelby Oaks gave me a terrifyingly great time. It was just me and my brother at the screening, and while that was a bit sad (I wish more people went to see it), the empty cinema actually made the amplified the experience.

The movie starts strong, instantly pulling you into its mystery. It opens with a documentary-style, handheld feel that immerses you right away. The pacing was consistent, I never felt bored. Instead, it kept building tension and paranoia to the point where I started feeling watched. I found myself scanning the background of every shot, waiting to catch something lurking. The cinematography, performances, and direction were all impressive. The jump scares felt earned, not cheap, and the suspense built so effectively that at one point I just wanted the scare to finally happen.

The story was mostly strong, though I did find myself asking a few questions by the end. Still, it was more engaging and well thought-out than many thrillers or horror films made by bigger studios. You could really tell everyone involved cared about delivering quality. The ""husband"" character, however, seemed useless, I won't go into detail, but he didn't add much.

The third act gets a bit chaotic. There's one particularly disturbing scene that genuinely unsettled me, and I'm still not sure if that's a compliment or not. I also tend to prefer horror that stays grounded and mysterious, and Shelby Oaks leans a little too far into the over-the-top paranormal chaos near the end. It slightly pulled me out of what had been a wonderfully tense and believable build up.

You can sense the Mike Flanagan influence throughout, fitting, given Flanagan's support for Stuckmann as a first-time director.

Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed Shelby Oaks. I'm not sure if it'll have the same effect on a second watch anytime soon, but I'd fully recommend it. This is what horror should be about: suspense, earned scares, strong atmosphere, and a story that keeps you invested. Sure, it's a bit of a mixed bag tonally, part documentary, part found footage, part mystery, part supernatural horror, but that's also what makes it unique.

It's not a perfect film, but it's passionate, creative, and full of heart. For a debut, it's deeply respectable, and it captures everything I love about horror.",literal
"🌎A little More World Building would of Really Helped this Film Just Got Out of an Early Screening of The Long Walk.

It's a Very Engaging, at times Depressing and at other times, quite a Rough Watch.

👣 - I'm sure you know the premise. The Rules are to Keep up a 3mph(in the film) minimum walk, for a distance of roughly just past 331 miles. Do anything else and you get to ""leave"" the contest.

Strengths of this Film -

👍 - The main pool of Characters are good enough to watch that you should be engaged with this film.

👍 - Moreover, the Dynamics of the Characters and how things go amongst them is also good to watch as you go along this journey with them.

🚸 - The Film has this Journey/Adventure feel of the film from the moment they start

My Gripes with the Film -

🤷 - Some of the Character Decisions are at times from left field. And this happens a number of times.

📃 - The World Building of why in the hell would you even go through this wasn't developed well enough, we are sort of just thrown in there and because of that, it's that much harder for you to go with why the participants are even doing this.

⌛- The Film is Too Long for what it's doing, I think a tighter runtime would of served this film perfectly.

But overall, it was a flawed but good watch.",figurative
"Useless I totally hated this show. Couldn't stand it. Just fast-forwarding two episodes. Poor actress, going from the worlds best TV show to the worlds worst. And i seen A lot of TV shows. They are really trying to ride the doctor wave. Its getting so boring, and everything seems so unrealistic.

They are just throwing stuffs at us to make it look like an interesting show but its pathetic. Wont even last 1 season.

It seemed like a good idea when i heard about it, and i can assure everybody that it probably looked awesome on paper, it had to do so they could lure in such a great actress, but it was very untasteful, after seeing two episodes i didn't just dislike it, I hated it. Watch Royal Pains or something else instead, I'm not used to hate TV-shows so this really feels wrong but it was awful. Please don't let them do two seasons",literal
"Masterpiece, the best show in the history of television What can be said that hasn't already been said before about the Sopranos? This is as close to perfection as any series has to offer. Having just finished my second complete watch through of this I already find myself wanting to watch all over again. James Gandolfini is superb throughout as the lead actor and was simply born to play this role. This isn't just about the mob or violence it goes so much deeper than that, exploring the different aspects of the character's lives, loves, relationships and feelings. David Chase's fantastic direction right from the pilot episode all the way through to the end is spot on, often leaving thought provoking hidden meanings for the viewer to ponder and work out for themselves. This show simply sets the bar for which all shows after it have never been able to reach",figurative

What the eff is this about! I don't know, i have no idea after watching this horrible thing.",literal
"Sinners is a powerful, character-driven story with horror woven in-not just a good horror film, but a great film, period. My wife and I recently watched Sinners (2025) in theaters. The film tells the story of twin brothers from Mississippi who've just returned home from Chicago and are opening a nightclub during the Prohibition era. They're planning a grand opening celebration featuring an all-star lineup of local blues musicians-but a group of unwanted, bloodthirsty guests has plans to crash the party and ruin the night.

Written and directed by Ryan Coogler (Creed), the film stars Michael B. Jordan (Creed), Miles Caton, Delroy Lindo (Crooklyn), Hailee Steinfeld (True Grit), Omar Benson Miller (8 Mile), and Li Jun Li (Babylon).

The first half of Sinners is rich with character development and cultural depth. The realism is brilliant-from the Mississippi/Chicago connection (which resonated deeply with my wife's own family background) to the incredible blues subplot that brings soul and authenticity to the story. The party scene alone is a masterclass in filmmaking-brimming with energy, culture, and community. Spike Lee would be proud.

Delroy Lindo delivers yet another underrated performance-he was probably my favorite character. Michael B. Jordan is excellent as always, and Miles Caton makes a powerful breakout debut. The acting across the board is full of nuance, expression, and authenticity.

The horror elements, particularly the vampire twist, are expertly woven in. Much like From Dusk Till Dawn, the film shifts gears midway through, transforming into something entirely different for a stretch. But unlike Dusk, which leans into fun chaos, Sinners pulls the themes back together with real emotional and narrative depth. The horror doesn't overwhelm-it enhances. The film's final act ties both worlds together in a meaningful, thought-provoking way.

I haven't even mentioned the era-accurate details-attire, dialogue, lifestyle, and perspective-all spot-on. Sinners is a layered, well-executed film that delivers far more than just horror thrills.

In conclusion, Sinners is a powerful, character-driven story with horror woven in-not just a good horror film, but a great film, period. Ryan Coogler, the cast, and the production team all knocked it out of the park. I'd give it a solid 8.5/10 and strongly recommend it.",literal
"Why the negativity? Chad Powers is just a solid, fun watch. It's got that Eastbound & Down vibe - cocky athlete, big fall, wild comeback - but with a slightly less mean, more self-aware twist. Glen Powell's got the charm and humor to carry it, and the show doesn't take itself too seriously. He's up there on my actors list he needs to do more shows and movies he's on my top 10 with Keanu and Ryan Reynolds.

It's not deep or groundbreaking, but it's consistently entertaining without being boring. The LGBHDTV character? Just part of the team - no big deal! And he's entertaining addition to the show, which is how it should be. Some critics are split, but if you're into sports comedies with a bit of heart and a lot of ego, this one's worth a shot to give it a watch!",literal
"very fun sequel that doesn't evolve further Back in 2021, a sleeper hit got released called NOBODY. Nobody expected this to do as well as it did. It took a generally funny man Bob Odenkirk and turned him into an unexpecting badass action hero. It was a great take on the typical dynamic of ""family man with a secret murderous job"". Now, as with most things these days, there's a sequel called, you guessed it, NOBODY 2. After the events of the first one, Hutch (Bob Odenkirk) is forced to work for The Barber (Colin Salmon) to pay off his debt. Feeling physically and mentally drained, he goes on vacation with his family, desperately trying to make some new memories. They go to a small rundown theme park, where his father (Christopher Lloyd) took him and his brother (RZA) when they were kids. Think NATIONAL LAMPOON'S VACATION meets JOHN WICK meets HOME ALONE. This being a sequel, the ""newness"" of the concept gets kind of stale in the latter half of the movie, but it makes up for it with very fun and violent action scenes. The music definitely adds to the fun also. There's nothing new that is learned about the protagonist, but Odenkirk is just SO great in this. The rest of the cast is good too. Christopher Lloyd is under-used, but Sharon Stone has the time of her life just hamming it up on screen. If you enjoyed the original (which I can't find for free anywhere at the moment), then you'll have fun with this one. Remember, if you discover an undercover crime ring while on vacation, you better call Saul.",literal
"Nothing like the real Ed Gein Pathetic and haphazard retelling remotely based off one of the most iconic killers of the 20th century. None of the actors fit the parts except maybe Lori Metcalf. Total waste of time and money. This is the dumbest, most torturous, ridiculous adaptation of the most imof all times. They've ruined the story and what could have been an authentic chilling account of Ed Gein. Nothing makes sense and the story is not even barely accurate.",literal
"A timeless sitcom that never gets old The Office is a mockumentary style sitcom that is loosely based on the British sitcom of the same name. One of my all-time favourite movies is 2008's ""Get Smart"" starring Steve Carell and Anne Hathaway. Despite being a massive Steve Carell fan, I only started watching The Office in 2022.

The creative team behind the hit 2005 series ""The Office"" knows the characters extremely well and can flesh out each character's arc in a meaningful way. Each character is given separate personality traits and a rich and layered backstory. Most of the characters are multifaceted with endearing and often eccentric quirks.

The writing of the series is impeccable. It wasn't written for the early 2000s time period, rather is meant to be topical and funny decades after it aired. I love how the writers manage to sneakily include jokes even in episodes with a rather serious subject matter. Each episode manages to maintain the series' excellent momentum and comedic timing.

Mindy Kaling, BJ Novak, Paul Lieberstein, and Michael Schur all pulled double duty and managed to both write and act on the series. It is particularly surprising and amusing that Paul Lieberstein who portrays Toby Flenderson wrote Michael Scott's iconic and hilarious insults to the character. Michael's bitter rivalry with Toby is one of the highlights of the series. ""Toby Flenderson to the principal's office. Your mother called and it appears you wet the bed again. So, you need to go home and wash your sheets because they are all yellow and wet with your urine.""

Steve Carell as Michael Scott is the obvious standout of the series. His goodbye episode was extremely poignant and emotional, which further exemplifies Steve Carell's stellar acting. After Steve Carell departed the show in season 7, the series declined in quality and took a significant nosedive.

The ninth season is far better than the disastrous eighth season, but still does not have the same charm and wit as the seasons starring Steve Carell. Fortunately, the final five episodes of the ninth season reclaimed its title of being televisions no. 1 comedy. However, one aspect of the eighth and ninth season I will never forgive the writers is how they completely butchered the Andy character. They made the character unlikeable and the most hated figure on the series. Heck, Andy was even worse than Nellie to some extent.

Jim and Pam are one of the best television couples, and the chemistry between John Krasinski and Jenna Fischer is palpable from the start. I'm glad that John Krasinski and Jenna Fischer are friends in real-life, and even asked the casting director and producers if both landed their respective roles. One of my all-time favourite Jim and Pam moments is when Jim gives Pam the DVD with all the highlights of their relationship. That was an incredibly emotional scene which made me cry. Also, Jim and Pam's wedding was bittersweet. Specifically, Jim's plan to marry Pam secretly without being overshadowed by the wedding guests is beautiful and one of the most romantic moments of the entire series. The closing shot of them at Niagara Falls is utterly beguiling. Jim and Pam are hands down my OTP of the series and perhaps also in general.

Final verdict: 10/10.",literal

James Bond uses devices not yet invented and Frodo has hairy feet.

Not as good as the first but still decent I absolutely loved the first black phone film and found it to be a pleasantly great surprise. I was very interested in a sequel and I didn't know how it would work personally. I think the film is fine but it doesn't live up to the first film for me at all and I felt kind of disappointed throughout the film. I feel like the film was a bit unnecessary and I wish it would've been left alone and been a one off film. I think the movie has intriguing ideas and some of them work out but some moments don't work at all for me. I think the acting here is good for the most part and Madeline McGraw does a really strong performance and she kind of takes the lead role over from Mason Thames and I think they both do really good jobs in the film. Ethan Hawke is also terrifying as the grabber again as well and when he's on the screen he's great. There's also some beautiful shots and visuals here and I really like in these dream sequences when they use this grainy camera to capture the dream sequences here and I like the nightmare on elm street elements in the movie as well with the Grabber too. There's a decent story here though and I feel like they have some interesting story elements here but they don't execute it too well. I just don't like how they barely used the grabber though and it feels like the movie barely uses him and he has like little to no screen time at all. I also wish they would've used Finney more he's such a great character and he just gets sidelined for the most part and takes a massive backseat here. I think the movie is also not terrifying at all and there's legit no horror at all throughout the movie and I felt so disappointed by how little of horror was presented in this film and the grabber legit doesn't do like anything for the most part. This is still solid but I felt disappointed by this story here and it's still worth checking out but I feel disappointed still.,literal

"Brilliant TV in every sense I don't normally leave reviews but this show is just so good in every sense. From what felt like a slow first episode, the tension and drama soon ramped up in episode 2 and now at the penultimate episode, devastated it's going to be ending next week! The acting is phenomenal from the whole cast, with Mark Ruffalo and Tom Pelphrey (who was brilliant in Ozark and Banshee) delivering stand out performances. The storytelling and acting means you genuinely care for the characters - which isn't always the case even in the best shows. The setting, like Ozark and Bloodline, just adds to the whole drama and the way it's shot and the landscape is just beautiful and fitting. Beautiful TV show and deserves more love and praise - can't fault it.",literal

"This had me on the edge of my seat the whole time in a bad way! The way that this was handled was prefect, there was no glorification of the violence that some series allow. This was a story driven decent into his life where no one can feel sorry for him. We see all moments from his younger ages to his worthy death in prison which is only the second murder we actually see play out on screen.

With so many series that center around serial killers the murders are at the forefront just to satisfy a certain audience. Much like Mindhunter and also the fictional Hannibal the story is well written and completely grounded to be true to the victims. There were moments of shouting at the Tv on how did he get away with so much for so long. Which throws so many questions at law enforcement during this time.

The acting performance from Peters is one of these that should be herald as one of the greatest in tv for being so like the real like person but not the way that quite a few people were reacting during the height of the series popularity. Just goes to so some people are weirdly drawn to serial killers.

Overall this is one of the great depictions of a serial killer totally up there with the mindhunter actors!",literal

"Escapism Supernatural is a hell of an accomplishment to get up to 15 season, now I must admit I fell out the loop on the show round maybe season 10, I couldn't actually say, to be fair this show is just great to have on in the background or if you just want to enjoy a little escapism, you can see and feel the actors having a good time, and everyone knows or has heard how good friends the cast are off set. If you just want a break something enjoyable to watch, something easy, this I would recommend, if you hadn't seen this by now, you've got a lot of catching up to enjoy, that would be one crazy binge haha.",literal
"Such a waste of talented actors. This movie starts off with an interesting premise and show of the supposed process of what would happen if we were attacked.

Jan packed with numerous actors we are lead through several views of what is happening during the countdown to a nuclear weapon taking out Chicago.

Don't read further if you want to watch this movie and you waste 2 hours of your time...

In the end, nothing is shown. You won't know what happened. Was it real? Was it fake? Who attacked?

At best it just seems like our government has no idea what to do in this situation. All things considered it's probably true.

So watch if you want to have a rather suspenseful first 30 minutes. After that feel free to stop at any point, because they opted to show nothing new after that.",literal
"Good, but Needed Trimming The singing and dancing in Wicked Part 1 were very good, and the opening was captivating, but the pleasure gradually waned as the movie went on, and on ... and on. By the final ten minutes or so I was praying they would stop singing and just wrap it up. I love music and musicals, so this was an unusual reaction on my part.

Before going to see this, I hadn't realised it was only part 1. That was a bit disappointing. I also never realised the film was so long. Two hours and forty minutes will delight some, but for me, the story and production weren't tight enough to keep me engaged to the end.

From this novice's viewpoint, the editing was done with love rather than with a view to creating a tight film. There were many scenes that would have benefitted from some cuts, without losing any of the overall delight.",literal
"Beautiful Stage Design, Too long, Unfinished story... Wicked boasts stunning visuals and extravagant stage design that immediately immerse you in its fantastical world. However, the beauty feels overly done at times, overshadowing the story and leaving viewers longing for substance.

My biggest issue: A runtime of 2 hours and 40 minutes that still doesn't finish the story. Splitting the movie into two parts felt like a cash grab-forcing those who've invested their time into one half to pay for a second trip to the cinema. Why not tell the complete story in one movie?! Create a mini-series or make an independent film with a beginning, middle, and end.

While the filmmakers claimed they wanted two parts to explore deeper relationships and character dynamics, the extended musical sequences-beautiful as they were-could have been halved to allow to finish the storytelling.

Cynthia Erivo's voice is enchanting. Ariana Grande felt like she was playing herself.",literal
"Impressive I expected a comedy because of who the lead is , the first minute in you can just feel this show has immense quality behind it there has to be a team that actually cares about what they put on the screen. The first 3-4 minutes gives you a scary idea of the world of the show and I loved it. The direction is simple but the tone , writing score and atmosphere is perfectly done .",literal
"First episode is surprisingly good! At first I thought this was going to be a comedy along the lines of Psych! Or an absurd comedy like Always Sunny. I mean, the only characters I've ever seen Kaitlin Olson play are trashy women with a very caustic sense of humor. If that's what you like about her, don't worry, she definitely brings both of those qualities to this role. But she somehow does it in a mature way.

Although the first episode is all I've seen so far, it does appear to be a series similar to the aforementioned Psych! And it's fraternal twin, The Mentalist. It features Olson playing a character with an extremely high IQ who also suffers from a type of OCD, where she obsesses about things that are out of place. She also has a very fine sense of observation, and she uses these quirks to assist the local police in solving crimes.

This isn't a drama detective show, but it's not a comedy played for laughs either. It's a light action crime show like ABC's The Rookie and even gives me vibes of FX's brilliant Rescue Me series from the early 2000s.

The first episode was enjoyable and I hope the show continues along the same lines, with just enough dark humor to make it enjoyable, but without turning into a joke.",literal
"Amazing! I have been a nurse for 40 years - 20 of that as a nurse practitioner. I spent 20 years in ICU and ER, so I typically hate medical shows because they are so inaccurate. I binged the first season of The Pitt in 2 days! It is the most accurate medical show I have ever seen. Not just the medical aspect, but the effect on all those involved - staff, patients and families. Thank God someone finally got it right! I would encourage everyone, not just medical professionals, to watch this show. It has something to teach us all about life, death, fear, hope, and most of all, humanity. I would give it 20 stars if I could.",literal
"Eraserhead with less meaning and fewer laughs Everything done here is so laboriously and blatantly neurotic that as it wrings itself dry all meaning evaporates. You are not meant to know what is going on in the film, but you do know what was going on with the writing of the film. The symbolism is extremely rough and basic. The crudeness is so in your face that it fails to shock or even generate much interest. An overworked Eraserhead remake without the real fear, ambiguity and artfulness of it's far superior predecessor. I give it 5 because the acting is outstanding.",literal
"Terrible, just terrible Absolutely awful. I would rather watch paint dry and listen to a nail scratch against a chalk board for 2 hours than watch this film again. I kept thinking maybe this will go somewhere, but then they would just cut to some abstract BS that made 0 sense. I will say tho, I ordered some Buffalo chicken strips at the theater that slapped, so my experience was not all bad.",literal
"Huge fun Should have been a 12 episode series and the finale ended too abruptly, but well cast, well acted, decent plot progression, funny in the right places. All the right ingredients for a bingeable show (which we did) but just stopped after the 8 eps rather than feeling like a satisfying finalé until hopefully season 2 whenever or if that arrives (big - NO HUGE - problem with knowing whether or not to bother with short Netflix shows who take ages to hold onto audiences with news and updates on renewals and when). Great, fun, show tho !

Totally recommend, and don't listen to the bomb review people .

"Not a normal Kevin James movie I love Kevin James and Alan Ritchson. However this just goes sideways for me after their funny meeting exchange.

With two kids, ages not defined, I would have expected it to be more kid friendly.

I found there to be so much action with little dialogue. Would have been funny if the dialogue was clear and the action was not so manic.",literal
"Very cool, well-done show. I can't account either for the poor taste of people giving this show low stars. It is excellently done in all respects. High quality neo-noir and with humor. Reminds me of the Coens, but then so many productions these days remind me of the Coens. Very believable incredible characters (that's an oxymoron, right?). A pleasure to see Kyle MacLachlan resurrect his EVIL Agent Cooper from David Lynch's final ""Twin Peaks"" masterpiece. A real treat to see Dinklage appear and raise the bar for the show.",figurative
"To call this a show it's unfair... It's the pertect 86 hour movie! Simply the best writing, and the best acting... I've seen it five times and it never gets old... I'm an absolut tv and movie geek, thousands of hours invested in this ""lifestyle"" and still nothing beats The Sopranos... And nothing will ever beat it... James Gandolfini steals every second of his screen and non-screen time, makes you wish these guys would still be in the 20th seasson if James would be alive! Can't wait for The Saints of Newark... Johnny Boy Soprano played by Jon Bernthal OMFG!!",figurative
"Rambo goes to Finland Who knew that Quentin Tarantino's long rumored 11th movie would be set in Finland?

I joke of course, but this movie is clearly the illegitimate child, conceived in sin but so so beloved, of Rambo and Tarantino! Everything from the titles to the themed ""chapters"" to the visual appearance screams Quentin.

The only thing that's missing is that ever so witty dialog, that craziness whether it's musings on McDonalds, or ""What Kent wears - the glasses, the business suit - that's the costume. That's the costume Superman wears to blend in with us. Clark Kent is how Superman views us. And what are the characteristics of Clark Kent. He's weak... he's unsure of himself... he's a coward. Clark Kent is Superman's critique on the whole human race."" But one can't have everything!

"A Good Show Turned Predictable and Annoying When a show loses the main chemistry, it's not easy to go back to how it was. The right thing to do is try, and if the new plan doesn't work, give up. Unfortunately, SVU still tries things that were already done a long time ago, done better.

The main problem with the show started when they lost their main character, the partner of Det. Olivia Benson. They tried several times to recreate that chemistry, but they failed. So, the new strategy was to focus on Olivia.

Now the show is completely different from what it was ten years ago. Back then, it was a show about police cases with a little bit of background stories for the detectives. Today, the show puts the cases in second plan and focus too much on the detectives. I'm tired of watching Olivia, or those other characters with weak stories. I'm also tired of the cases that are so predictable. All of the Law & Orders had a very basic plot: a crime happens, the detectives go see the crime scene, the investigation starts with a very good suspect, some other suspects are shown and they find the guy, but then, in a plot-twist they find out that the one who did it was the first suspect all along. Now, when you do that for almost 20 years, even a kid can find out how the story ends. And there's only a limited number of ways to rape and hurt women and children.

If anybody wants to watch this, go to the first seasons, they're amazing. Since 2012, the show turned into a circus, it's everywhere and too much is happening for us to actually care.",literal
"Review of Seasons, 1, 2, and 3 Review of Season 1: 9 stars

In the first season of ""Absentia,"" the filmmakers hit all the right notes for a suspenseful 10-part series. Each episode is carefully crafted with especially strong work on film editing. Above all, the script is brilliant in its character development, plot turns, and lively dialogue.

The series is also memorable for the cast, an assemblage of little-known actors. Stana Katic is terrific in the lead role of Emily Byrne. But the ensemble is a core group that was perfectly cast. The old, crusty father of Emily, a savvy ex-cop who believes in his daughter's innocence, is a standout. There was also an interesting assortment of cops (especially the slovenly Tommy Gibbs), rogues (the sleazy Conrad Harlow), and Em's brother Jack, the former medical doctor who lost his license due to alcoholism. Nick, the luckless and rather dim-witted husband, was perfectly played by the actor. All are excellent.

In the film's visual effects, the writers were clearly in tune with main setting of Boston and the surrounding cities. But it was clear that the film was not shot on location. There could have been more stock footage to truly establish the great locales of Boston, including the old warehouse that was tied to The Great Boston Molasses Flood of 1919. Still, the historical details of that event and other interesting locales (especially the Edgewater Psychiatric facility) were cleverly incorporated into the script.

In sum, the first season was a creative and suspenseful series with every episode successful in building suspense and engaging the audience in the characters. One of the most touching themes was that of the love of a mother for her child. In the case of this series, there were two mothers equally devoted to little Flynn. That motif figures in the final plot twist that is revealed in episode 10. This thematic concern elevated ""Absentia"" beyond a purely escapist enterprise and invested the series with some heartfelt drama.

Review of Season 2: 9 stars

The second season of ""Absentia"" obviously lacked some of the suspense from the first season because a number of the suspicious characters had been cleared of anything sinister. For example, FBI SA in charge Crown was a suspect in season one, but turned out to be clean. The same was true for the erratic character of Dr. Jack, who despite engaging in unsavory internet activity, evolved into a nice guy when he sobered up.

Despite the challenges of duplicating the achievements of the first season, the filmmaker actually increased the suspense in season two, especially in the closing episodes. The characters were well developed, the dialogue was crisp, and the production values were superb. Above all, it was the clever plotting that kept the audience guessing between programs five and ten.

There was also strong directorial work throughout the second season. While the exterior scenes looked less and less like Boston and more and more like Bulgaria where the filming took place, the film received a boost in the sequence in Moldova. The set-ups and compositional choices were outstanding. The framing of the scene where Cal is saluting his deceased friend Holt with Em looking on was a brilliant and moving moment, due to the camera angle and lighting.

Many accolades are due the ensemble cast for inhabiting their characters and evoking layers of interpretation. The result was that audience truly came to know the characters and became engaged in the question of who was the mastermind and the accomplice. This was filmmaking at its finest and closer to a feature film than a television series.

Season 3: 9 Stars

This third season was my favorite thus far. The narrative was leaner than the previous two seasons, avoiding the pitfalls of an overly convoluted plot. The focus was on the attempt by the shady Meridian operation to test a powerful biological toxin on a group of refugees. The secondary plot was the infiltration of the Boston FBI office by a mole working in concert with the villains.

In the poor boy from Nebraska, Elliott Brandstetter, and the smooth-talking British operative, Dawkins, there were two especially nasty antagonists. They were enabled by an especially inept group of FBI agents who were compromised by the mole in their midst.

Once again, Stana Katic was great in the role of Emily (Em) Byrne. Her devotion to her son and overall decency were a breath of fresh air contrasted with the forces of evil. The familiar characters of Nick, Flynn, Gramps, Crown, and Cal added continuity from the previous series.

It was especially the characters of Julianne Gunnarsen and Brigitte Kerlan that added a new twist to the series. These two women modeled a façade of decency that was covering their depraved values. The main dramatic thrust of the final two episodes was the unmasking of Gunnarsen and Kerlan.

Once again, the film artists brought stylish approach to the drama with excellent use of close-ups, great location filming, and effective pacing. This is a series that is not to be missed!!!",figurative
"Amazing---ly Awful After reading a couple of fan-boy reviews stating how ""amazing"" The Office is, I can only wonder what show they're watching. Maybe they're thinking of the original, which I have never seen (and now don't have any desire to), but surely this can't be the NBC version.

The NBC version is one of the most laughingly awful thing to ever disgrace our screens.

Whereas (from the reviews I read) the original had a documentary feel, the NBC producers decided that shaking the camera back and forth and to and fro was what was needed (probably someone at a development meeting said they had to up the ante or some other ridiculous thing).

The result is a show that is so badly shot that it makes Survivor look like an Orson Welles film in comparison.

Shame on the producers and shame on NBC for wasting its resources of this complete waste of screen time.",figurative
"Great performance! Steve Carrell demonstrates his acting skills. At first it's a little awkward watching, but when you get to know the characters and connect it's truely addictive. With exceptional mastery the writers manage to get through to the viewer, including enough exaggeration, the spirit of an office atmosphere. I've found a lot of deeply hidden social messenges.",literal
"Music! Hey Dick, why is your music so distracting from the story? Is the writing not good enough to carry the story? I think the actors are. If it is a good plot and done by good actors, give the story a chance to stand on its own.",literal
"Why?!?!?!? The stories and procedural aspects are extremely engaging. You can go from a chuckle to feeling like your heart is being ripped out and back to a smile again. That is exactly as it should be. The acting is great! Every actor and actress does a fantastic job of giving depth to their character, no matter the size of the part......BUT........why do we have to have social justice issue naratives. These political naratives are a distraction from the story and don't have any bearing on the story. Many of us watch these television series to get away from the BS that politicians and legacy media exaggerate. It's a shame that writers do this to shows that could be so great.",literal
"I love this series! When you watch a weekly show and you hate when it ends, that should tell you how much you like it. And I do!

I love the writers, the actors who portray characters so well you feel as though you know them and you feel the same emotions they do. I highly recommend this series and if you haven't watched it you owe it to yourself to sit down and binge watch it. Thank you for such a great Tuesday night addition.",literal
"Wow, just wow - 1st episode review Now, I'm no medical professional but damn, after watching shows like house, greys and a bunch of others, this is topping them all. Start to finish medical action with wit and drama without the stars making out in closets and exploring the love triangles which are assumed to be present in all hospitals.

They jump right into the action with disregard to trying to tick off all the political correctness narratives and have focused on a solid story line. It sort of reminds me of a real ER documentary without the standard Hollywood procedural drama. It's got realistic people, gore, reactions and verbiage.

Bravo showrunners. Only one episode in and hoping this doesn't U-turn into the housewives of ER and Greys Anatomy that we have come to know.",literal
"Netflix being Netflix A chaotic mash up of every trendy ingredient they could find: Squid Game, Battle Royale, samurai cosplay, anime vibes, and the cheapest cliffhangers imaginable. And somehow people love it?

Netflix is serving cinematic junk food, greasy, artificial, low effort fast entertainment and it gets a 7.5 rating. Wow!

Akira Kurosawa would rise from his grave just to die again after watching this parody of a ""Samurai"" story.",literal
"Way Too Predictable Soap When I saw this for the first time I already knew the plot in the film. The script for this is really horrible. I understand why the director did not want to make it. I knew the climax of the film before it was 30 minutes old. I hung around hoping it would get better. It did not.

The film has little to say in favor of it for me except for Hudson who tries desperately to make it seem real. No one could bring that off. He is too young to be romancing Wyman and too old to be with the younger actress.

Think this could be redone better starting with a new script. Then we need to get more dramatic moments in it. This one definitely is not the best platform for any one in the cast. I think this could have been so much better, a waste of talent and some of the window scenes are obviously fake. Universal did no one any favors with this movie.",literal
"A Great Thriller...and ignore the haters! This series is exactly the type of entertainment we're missing in today's ""reality television"" culture. The characters feel refreshingly honest in how they would react to the admittedly wild circumstances, but overall you can tell this was a passion project for the entire cast. Katic herself is a force and her character is easily empathized with throughout her journey...seriously just give the woman her Emmy already! As far as some of the negative reviews out there...let's just say it looks like some Fillion fans are still unjustly resentful and angry at Katic for the situation that went down last year. I say ignore the haters and, if you like thrillers, suspense, and films with deeper emotions and characters, then you'll love Absentia!",figurative
"I LOVED it People don't give this movie a chance cause its a Colleen Hoover movie and I get it. I was skeptical too, sure there are things that I'd change but overall I loved it.

I loved the story, the cast, the songs and this movie has good marketing. I wish they kept more stuff from the books, but overall it was good.

I loved even the subtle message, the cameos, even the outfits.

I definitely recommend it, but definitely for older teens and adults.",literal
"Great character, terribly boring story that should have been a movie There's not enough story to keep churning out episodes, and the story is awfully predictable. I really enjoy the main character as we hardly ever see this kind of character in center stage. She is rude, selfish, depressed and ultimately the only one who seemingly cares about the end of humanity. A complex character that one normally wouldn't root for, but damn I just love her.

The rest is a gimmick, the hive mind thing is boring and I feel like it's going way too slowly because there just isn't much of a story at all. It reminds me a bit of Lost, the OA and From where literally nothing happens at all, the only difference being that this main character is absolutely awful in all the best ways and completely redeemable.

Despite being crushed by having to witness the only person she cares about die, she still holds on to any semblance of humanity and tries to live honestly. I cannot begin to explain how much I like this character and she (and the actors portrayal) is the only reason I keep tuning in.",figurative
"Rehabilitation, Gaslighting and Other Fun Activities Let's be honest. People rating this low just hate that the lead is trans. Whatever. Mae Martin does a great job and Toni Collette is always amazing. The whole cast actually sells it.

Wayward is strange but interesting. It feels like a mix of mystery and psychological horror. You never really know what's real, and that's what keeps it cool. It's not perfect, a few scenes drag and some parts feel off, but it's got mood, tension, and a point of view.

It's really about control, manipulation and how people can twist good intentions into something messed up. That part hits.

The ending works, gives answers, but still leaves a bit to think about.

I'd give it a seven out of ten. Not flawless but way better than most shows out right now.",literal
"A missed opportunity for a deeper psychological dive It's well acted, well paced, and it captures the enormity of the trials. But as I watched I couldn't help feeling like it only brushed the surface of something far more complex, which is the psychology of the men being judged.

The film touches on it here and there with glimpses of pride, denial, rationalization, but never quite lets us sit in their mindset long enough to understand how such thinking takes root. I don't mean sympathy, but understanding.

Most films about this era stay safely on the side of ""righteousness"". A movie that truly follows the ""bad"" side, that dares to dissect the Nazi perspective without flinching could make one of the most unsettling and important films ever made. Nuremberg is strong, but it leaves that untold story still waiting for someone brave enough to tell it.

Maybe the reason the psychiatrist ends up committing 13 years later is because he was having a moral debate with himself over the trials and the ""good"" and ""bad"".",literal
"Wonderful Show The show starts a little slowly, but, as it goes on, it just keeps getting better and better. Stick with it. I especially like Zahn McClarnon in the lead role of Joe Leaphorn, but I have liked him in everything I've seen him in; he's always great, and--finally--he gets to be the lead in a show. Everyone else is also great: Kiowa Gordon as Jim Chee, Jessica Matten as Bernadette, and Noah Emmerich was a great addition to the first season.

It's been a long time since I read the Hillerman books, so I don't know how closely the series follows them. But I don't care. I have just seen Series 2 Episode 2, and I can't wait for the rest. I love that the characters often speak Diné and the scenery is great. I sure hope it is renewed for another season.",literal
"A Different Kind of Crime Show High Potential is a charming new show in the crime drama genre. The show's main character is a strong, independent, highly intelligent yet vulnerable woman raising three children. She's relatable and fun. The way the show develops the solving of crimes is interesting with some great comedic moments. Kaitlin Olson is fantastic as Morgan. She delivers a performance that has you instantly liking her character and wanting to know more. Judy Reyes and Daniel Suniata are terrific in their supporting roles. Even the kids perform well and lend some comedic moments to the show.

It's a quirky fun hour of entertainment.",literal
Solid First Season The first season was very good and I would have given the show a higher ranking but season 2 is weak. It has become very soap-opera-ish. Too many chaotic tangential stories and lots of annoying hysterics.,literal
"Morally pathetic. And awful random Christmas movie The main woman in the story basically has an affair with man days before her wedding before leaving the man who did nothing wrong at the alter. There is no sex but cheating is more than doing certain things of unfaithfulness. She lied and snuck away from her fiance without telling him anything and ended up happy I the end. No mention of what happened to man whose life she altered or how she destroyed the mother in law's trust. The Christmas theme is just thrown in. I understand it is important to follow your heart and do what I right and healthy for you, but don't hurt others in the process.",literal
"The writers really let themselves, their audience & Martin down... The first 5 Seasons of Game Of Thrones are exceptional, a beautifully structured series. The sets, characters, pacing, twists - exceptional. I could not fault it, however, after that things went downhill.

When it came to Season 5, the author of the books (George R. R. Martin) and HBO had a disagreement. Martin wanted the show to run across more series, to give all his complex story lines the chance to grow & move at a natural pace. HBO declined and so he dropped off the project, which is extremely evident.

Season 6 & 7, although flawed, were still watchable. The books & George's earlier comments paved the way for both seasons, but you could feel that the episodes lacked substance.

This brings us to the latest season, and after 2 years of waiting expectations were very high. The first two episodes were very plain, the reunions were wonderful, however you could tell they were setting up for one of the biggest fights of the series, which had been greatly anticipated since Season 1. I tried to not to have too high of expectations, however the director referred to episode 3 as ""bigger than Helms Deep"" which is a comment that will always spark excitement.

Episode 3 was so utterly disappointing, in every way. If you were somehow able to see through the intense darkness (what was the director thinking?) you will crumble to the poor decisions made by writers. I will not stem into this too much, but basically Dan & Dave chose to go down the Hollywood path, completely disregarding any real story or strategy. Episode 4 was equally as disappointing, which I was hoping would redeem the final season.

The writers have ruined this final season by fast tracking characters (basically teleporting), making the smartest of characters docile, and letting plot armor protect 'favorites'. I am still going to watch until the end, but I thought I would warn any future viewer to prepare yourself, as there is nothing more heartbreaking than watching terrible writing ruin a otherwise tremendous series.",literal
"Exceptional Ensemble-Despite a Smurf-Sized Speedbump ""Animal Kingdom"" delivers a wild, sun-soaked punch of adrenaline, anchored by a compelling cast and a storyline that grabs hold from the very first episode and doesn't let go. It's gritty, raw, and strangely poetic-with just the right amount of criminal chaos and surfboard swagger.

While Ellen Barkin's portrayal of Smurf is undoubtedly impressive (she's a powerhouse), the character herself is deeply off-putting. Her incessant ""baby"" this and ""baby"" that, mixed with an overly tactile approach to parenting her grown sons, toes the line between controlling and downright creepy. Smurf is less ""matriarch"" and more ""mob boss with boundary issues.""

Pope, on the other hand, is the show's darkly beating heart. Unpredictable and volatile, his struggle to be good-whatever ""good"" means in this family-gives the series its emotional weight. His internal conflict, shaped by Smurf's manipulative grip, is both tragic and mesmerizing.

Deran's guarded vulnerability and Craig's flair for self-destruction round out a dysfunctional, deeply human crew. These are characters you love despite their choices, not because of them.

The series evokes the spirit of Sons of Anarchy-loyalty, family above all, and the inevitable fallout when those lines blur. The writing is sharp, the pacing tight, and the cinematography makes the California coast feel both like a dream and a trap. The flashbacks and casting for younger versions of the characters are particularly well done-seamless and believable.

It's a shame the show wasn't renewed. Few series manage to balance heart, violence, and family dysfunction with such finesse. I'd binge it all over again in a heartbeat. Solid 9/10.",literal
"Visually Sublime But Sadly Disappointing I'm a massive fan of Guillermo's work. He's one of the only directors working in the film industry today that creates visual gothic feasts reminiscent of the movies I cherish from past decades. The colors, the lightning, the angles... he has it all.

When Frankenstein was announced as his next movie project, I was elated. This man could finally create a truly faithful adaptation of Mary Shelley's classic with the stylized visual flare to back it up. With Netflix's endless funds and a stellar cast, this would've (should have) been a slam dunk.

Sadly, I was more than a bit disappointed. The movie looks fantastic (as it should), and the writing is as good as one would expect from a feature of this magnitude... but the story really let me down. It strays way too far from the source material, and just like past adaptations, the things Del Toro decided to alter from the book lesson the emotional impact of the overall arc and themes.

No spoilers, but many of the humanistic undertones touched on by Shelley are completely lost because of some massive character and beat changes made here.

Don't get me wrong, the movie is far from terrible... I honestly don't think that Guillermo could make an awful film if he tried... but I was hoping for the definitive Frankenstein adaptation of our age and what I got was more of the same overly creative license that Hollywood has taken with every other Frankenstein that came before it.

Sad. 6/10 for the visuals.",figurative
"Disappointing in many ways At first glance, this looked interesting, but as several people have stated, you know what's going to happen in the first 15 minutes. The acting wasn't great, but to be fair, the actors didn't have a lot to work with.

The scenery was fabulous, great location. There's a wedding that is a complete joy to watch. It gave a White Lotus vibe, but this series is NO White Lotus.

I was so disappointed with the ending. I kept thinking there would be some big twist and it would justify the hours I spent watching this, but no.

I would not recommend this series.",literal
"Starts out alright, but COMPLETELY lost me by the middle of season 2. Want to watch some decent character development for the first season of a show, and then have it thrown into a dumpster and lit on fire midway through the very next? What if I told you there were 3+ more seasons where you get to watch the main characters endlessly orbit each other in what amounts to a sociopathic merry-go-round?

If that sounds like a good use of your time, you will enjoy Poldark.",figurative
"Reality check, please. I live in Tulsa. While Stallone's character is entertaining, as is most of the cast, the writing is more out of touch with reality than Stallone's character is. You can't just walk into a dispensary and say ""It's okay - I'm just looking around"" when they ask for your MM I. D. card. You wouldn't have to supply the dispensary with a security camera - they already have lots of them. A loaded Lincoln Navigator costs more than 50k. In almost every situation he's in, the police would have been called within seconds. I've only seen the first episode, but the ""wrongness"" of this show just goes on and on. But it's moderately entertaining.",literal
"Good thriller The thriller is good. Keeps you on the edge of your seat.

Her constant breathlessness is so distracting. She does it in all her performances. It's distracting.

Worth the watch.",literal
"When this movie's good, it's fantastic... Then again, when it's bad, it's overlong, faintly chauvinistic, and most definitely thicker than two short planks.

But don't get me wrong. xXx has a lot to recommend it. From an action point of view, this movie's about as much fun as you can have with your pants still on. Buildings explode, bullets fly by and Vin Diesel grins and goofs about like any self-respecting action star should. I mean okay, the movie doesn't give it's audience any credit for intelligence, utilising a paper-thin plot to lead us about like a blind man, and the entire female cast, even Asia Argento (who trust me is very good when she's GIVEN SOMETHING TO WORK WITH...), are really just left to sit around and look pretty while all the exploding goes on, but I can't hold that against it too much. It just must be explained first.

Given the way of the Hollywood blockbuster, i.e. the hideously PC lacklustre uninvolving pap we're getting force-fed these days that you instantly forget when you leave the theatre, it's nice to see a film that doesn't care if you like it or not. xXx is this movie. It knows it's not big, clever or funny, but it doesn't care and it gets on with it's exploding wares with admirable effort. In fact xXx is much like it's star Vin Diesel. He, and the film, may not be the greatest in their field but damn it they're gonna try as hard as possible to keep your bum on the seat.

They succeed. You won't be forgetting xXx in a hurry. You might not enjoy it as much as I did, but if none of this film leaves a gawping 'wow, they actually went and did that' expression on your face, you may well be dead. My only real criticism other than the movie's stereotypical nature (which is a given anyhow given it's director and publicity) is it's running time. I watched the extended special edition cut and it's about 2 hours 10 minutes. Either way you cut it that's a long time to sit through a movie that boils down to 'get girl, kill baddies'. Minor gripe though. Check it out, it's worth your time.",literal
"Sorry, he doesn't do requests. A dystopian retro-future, a deadly game-show, a garish yellow jumpsuit and just a few cheesy one-liners give 'The Running Man (1987)' a distinct spot in Schwarzenegger's library. While its story may have started life as a Steven King novel (written under a pseudonym), it's here transformed into a vehicle for its muscle-bound star to kill some bad-guys and yell at the host of the contest that he's caught up in. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the picture loses a lot of the subtext that its set-up - and, indeed, wider world - could have yielded, focusing more on its brash action and silly costumes. However, just enough of its underlying premise shines through to create an interesting, almost satirical and never-more-relevant setting for its decent set-pieces, on-the-nose comebacks and otherwise enjoyable high-concept carnage. The flick is generally entertaining but does start to lose a little steam in its mid-section, culminating in a finale that isn't as exciting as you might expect. It also features a strange romance that's rushed and just a tad predatory, too. Still, there are some undeniably fun sequences, including most of the stuff surrounding the aforementioned game-show, and the 'television take-down' angle is engaging, if a little extreme. Overall, this is a fun film with that's a little goofy in places and a little too serious in others. It's not a bad effort from Arnie, but it's not one of his best. 6/10",figurative
"Cliché with a Twist I'm not going to lie you'll notice a lot of cliche things about this & in this film but it's cliche with a hint of oomph to it. I had high expectations for this film and expected something uniquely spectacular just by the title, so i was kind of disappointed to find out that film simply revolved around a modernized version of the Sandman"".

However that doesn't change that fact that this movie still had a lot of good & heartwarming scenes, especially between two siblings. I wouldn't rate it the best but it's far from the worst. This movie was definitely still enjoyable. I'll rate it a fair 6.",literal
"I am lost... Never saw IT or the franchise or the pre-/sequels if there are any... That said I was happy to go into the series open-minded.

It would be unfair to rate it after the first episode, but the first episode ususally sets the tone. And I have no idea, who the audience should be.

The spelling-bee family? The demon-baby-flying-bat? The children as lead roles and their ""quirky"" dialogues?

I have no idea and I am lost. I will watch the second episode just to get rid of my prejudice (formed by episode 1). But for the first episode I would give 3/10.

"Diesel Is Decent As Latest Macho-Hero Vin Diesel is a pretty good guy to play these new action-heroes. Like ""The Rock,"" he's a big, muscular macho guy who men can look upon with some respect and the ladies can fall for. Unfortunately, a number of these testosterone-filled action films, including this one, are somewhat moronic in nature. However, they are undeniably entertaining.

You can always depend on one thing in these type of movies, from the ""biker movies"" of the '50s to today's films: the hero will always be a rebel against authority and any laws of the land. Also, an even more-recent theme is to have the government actually employ the rebel to get the job done because their men are unable to accomplish what this ultra-tattooed macho man can do! It's so much garbage, but it has its moments and Diesel still is a likable hero of sorts. Like Arnold Schwarzenegger before him, and Steven Seagal, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Chuck Norris and then ""The Rock,"" these kind of muscle-men have fairly clean mouths and at least some ideals.

For pure action, the movie succeeds because, in the end, it does entertain which is the name of the game.",literal
"Stella Kidd Another show that's centered around Stella. Getting really old. I just wish they would write her out somehow. She's way too bossy, acts like she runs the house.

Every time it centers around Stella, I change the channel. That said I do hope Cindy, Herman's wife, beats her cancer on the show. Hate to see her wrote out. All I can say is please quit with the all about Stella weekly series. Nothing more to add now.",literal
"Something different Just a little hope

Arj is struggling big time, no house, no solid job, nothing to be hopeful for. When he is let go from being Jeffs assistant who has an ultra wealthy life, Arj hits rock bottom. This is when an angel oversteps, Gabriel decides to give Arj a taste of Jeff's life to try and get him to be hopeful about his own life, this doesn't exactly go to plan.

It's a decent movie, some funny lines alright with a nice message that not everyone wants to be ultra wealthy that people are happy with a roof over their head and good on the table, the ability to not feel squeezed.

On the flip side I can absolutely see the message of a well hearted person who is ultra wealthy doing the right thing.

Seth Rogan and Keanu Reeves were good, I found Aziz a bit annoying and over acting a lot of the time to be quite honest. It lulled a bit here and there but overall the story kept moving. 6/10.",literal
"Great show!!! With one negative I wish the writers would change... I absolutely love this show, it's gripping and dramatic with great characters, you really get invested in the storylines. One negative though is because of the other linked shows, Chicago pd and Chicago med, they do some crossover episodes and a story can be started in Chicago fire but then continued in another Chicago show and they don't always tell you what happened to draw it to a conclusion, it's frustrating at times but the shows that good it's still worth watching",literal
"Nothing new Season two feels like a carbon copy of season one. The characters still don't develop - they remain flat, almost lifeless. If Wednesday was always meant to be emotionally detached, fine, but shouldn't the others be different? Nevermore Academy is little more than a pretty backdrop, one that Wednesday barely engages with. Most of the time she's off chasing mysteries elsewhere, only showing up at school events from time to time. And let's be honest - nobody at Nevermore actually studies. The rest of the students are just set dressing too; despite their powers, the writers almost completely forget about them. Naturally, Wednesday is the smartest and strongest of them all, even promising to ""protect"" her best friend (a three-meter werewolf) with her incredible talent... which talent, exactly? Getting into trouble?

If Wednesday's storyline at least has the intrigue of her investigations, Enid's plot this season is nonexistent. She just has a new boyfriend who adds absolutely nothing. It's only in the final episodes that Enid becomes remotely interesting again - but that just circles us back to the same themes as season one: friendship and acceptance.

The new villain was genuinely charismatic and played the role well. But guess what? Once again, Morticia and Gomez's past at Nevermore is tangled up in everything.

I really enjoyed Thing's storyline - that was the show's best element - and Uncle Fester, who still carries the Adams' signature madness. But the rest of the Addams family? They've changed - and not for the better. The very essence of the Addamses feels lost. They no longer live as outcasts in a ""normal"" world; instead, they're just an ordinary family in a not-so-ordinary society. Morticia has lost her signature calm and dark poise from past adaptations; now she's written as a standard worried mom of a rebellious teen. Gomez feels weaker than Morticia, when before they were equals, perfectly complementing one another. I can't buy into the love between this Morticia and Gomez anymore, even though the casting could have worked. They simply lack chemistry. Ironically, the younger versions of Gomez and Morticia have tons of chemistry. And poor Pugsley - he still doesn't get a meaningful storyline. Honestly, he shouldn't have been made a regular this season.

I also feel bad for Bianca and Ajax. Their plots existed just for the sake of existing. Bianca at least had a flimsy side arc with her mother, but Ajax was reduced to background filler. He only used his powers when the script demanded it.

In the end, we're left with a pile of villains and half-baked storylines, and watching it all play out doesn't really feel worth it anymore.

Netflix seems terrified of creating anything new. Sabrina, Winx, Vampire Academy... Wednesday. All of them follow the same formula: a ""weird"" school, supernatural powers, and a main character edging into Mary Sue territory. And while I don't want to call Wednesday a Mary Sue, the writers are doing a pretty good job of pushing her closer and closer to that archetype. Honestly, they should have just made an original series without tying it to the Addams Family at all - because somewhere along the way, the true spirit of the Addamses was lost. I can't buy into the idea of this perfectly kooky family anymore.",figurative

* Uneven Pacing in Later Seasons: While the first season is tightly plotted, later seasons have moments where the focus shifts too much between subplots, occasionally losing momentum.



* Not Always Subtle: The show sometimes spells out its messages too explicitly rather than letting them unfold naturally.


Conclusion

The Morning Show is a compelling, high-quality drama with top-tier performances and a willingness to tackle timely issues head-on. While it occasionally veers into melodrama, its strong writing, gripping conflicts, and standout cast make it a must-watch for fans of intense workplace dramas.",figurative
"Part fact part fiction but absorbing drama My Review-House of Guinness Streaming on Netflix My Rating 8:10

I really enjoy Docudrama series especially when there about dysfunctional famous families.

The Guinness family is certainly one of the most famous Irish families the founder of the Guinness family and its iconic brewery was Arthur Guinness, who established the St. James's Gate Brewery in Dublin in 1759.

The series begins with the death and funeral of the grandson of Arthur Guinness now the family patriarch Sir Benjamin Lee Guinness.

We are introduced to his four problematical children Edward, Anne ,Arthur and Benjamin , nest of vipers with secrets that their enemies can use against them .

Those enemies were the foundation members of The Irish Republican Brotherhood, known as the Fenians .

The mob riot during his funeral, protesting Guinness' business ties with the English, but Guinness warehouse foreman Sean Rafferty employs measured violence to ensure the streets are cleared.

This series has an impressive cast that includes James Norton as Sean Rafferty an ex military strong man and go between for the Guinness heirs. The four children of Sir Benjamin are well played by Anthony Boyle as Arthur the elder brother who later has his political aspirations threatened by his closeted homosexuality, Edward the quieter more sensible brother is played by Louis Partridge.

Edward has big ideas for the brewery and is convinced he should be the one to take the factory forward.

Their sister Anne Plunket is well played by Emily Fairn who has influence despite her frailty due to ill health and a laudanum addiction. The young black sheep son of the family who obviously is an alcoholic is Benjamin and played well by Fionn O'Shea.

It's a very impressive ensemble cast special mention must be made of Niamh McCormack who plays Ellen Cochrane sister of one of the rebels and Edwards lover plus Danielle Galligan who plays Arthur's wife Olivier in a lavender marriage of convenience.

House of Guinness is an impressive well directed and interesting series I only hope there will be a series 2 as the dramatic cliff hanger certainly leaves you wanting to know what happened?

Written by Steven Knight and Ivana Lowell and directed by Tom Shankland and Mounia Akl the series didn't please all the remaining Guinness family .

Not all Guinness descendants are pleased. The Netflix series about the heirs to the Guinness brewing company in the late 1800s, fabricates much of the family's life to tell a more TV-friendly story.",literal
"refreshingly Polynesian From the opening lyrics to the final shot, Moana was a fun glimpse into Polynesian life. Reminds me of Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron with its depiction of tribal peoples, people who depend on the land and environment to live. As one of the several catchy songs say, the island gives them everything they need. No need to go beyond the reef.

I'm glad that Moana and Zootopia, Disney's two most recent feature films, humorously refer to the archetypal Disney traits that appear in film after film -- i.e. an animal sidekick, the heroine bursting into song, following your dreams. Even if they do year after year, it never gets old. (... Well, maybe a little bit. I'm actually jaded by the happy ending trope in practically every work of film, literature, etc. out there. But that's beside the point.) Even if you can predict the ending of Moana, it's not quite what you expected. Disney has recently been changing things up a bit and having creative endings. Frozen, for example. Even if they weren't slightly creative, the story still enacts the Disney magic -- the ability to inspire, motivate, uplift, and ultimately enlighten further on mankind's communal desire to go beyond the norm. You don't have to do something amazing to make a name for yourself. It's not the hook that defines you, it's what you do that defines you and makes you who you are. Just don't follow hard tradition all the time. If someone says you can't achieve your dreams, he/she is most likely right. HOWEVER. That's only true if you don't give it your all. Those right now who are living their dreams gave it their all. If it's something you really want, after all, then naturally you'll give it the necessary effort and force of will. It won't be easy; life wasn't meant to be easy.

It's not as amazing as Zootopia, but Moana is still a genuinely good Disney movie. It has a superb single, a nice accompanying soundtrack, great characters, sublime animation with crystal- clear attention to detail, and wonderful themes and messages. I admit, I was expecting too much from Moana after seeing Zootopia, which is probably why I give Moana a 9. Zootopia hits the 10. If you haven't seen either one, I recommend seeing Moana first.",literal
"Film Review: The Shadow's Edge - Familiar Jianghu Spirit with a Long-Awaited Edge On Friday, August 22, the Bright Future of Humanity Global AI Film Competition officially kicked off at the Steven J Ross Theater on the Warner Bros. Studio lot in Burbank, the heart of Hollywood filmmaking. Veteran Hollywood producer Ellen Eliasoph was invited as a special guest and spoke during the forum session.

After the event, casual conversation turned to the recent Chinese box-office hit The Shadow's Edge. The film's director Larry Yang and producer Victoria Hon are close friends of Eliasoph, who later joined a special ""Expert Screening"" session on August 26 to watch the film.

The film tells the story of a hacker gang that steals billions in cryptocurrency and outsmarts the police AI surveillance system known as ""Sky Eye."" With no other options, Macau police recruit retired surveillance master Huang Dezhong ""Jackie Chan"" to mentor rookie officer He Qiuguo ""Zhang Zifeng"" and rebuild the ""mysterious surveillance team."" Together, they face off against criminal mastermind Fu Longsheng ""Tony Leung Ka-Fai"", in a tightly wound game of cat and mouse. Within the framework of a crime-action thriller, the film cleverly weaves in trendy elements of AI and cryptocurrency, while contrasting old-school tailing methods with modern surveillance technology, creating fresh narrative tension.

The film's greatest strength is its pacing. The story unfolds almost like it's in ""fast-forward,"" yet character development doesn't suffer. Jackie Chan's Huang Dezhong turns logical deduction into part of his physical performance-""action in sync with thought""-delivering exactly the kind of high-energy summer spectacle audiences crave. While calling it Chan's best performance in a decade might be overstating things-his acting and action remain firmly in his signature style-this is certainly the best project he has been part of in the past ten years. Director Larry Yang's brisk pacing and light comedic touch also mesh perfectly with Chan's current on-screen persona of ""retired but not resting.""

Tony Leung Ka-Fai, as always, delivers an outstanding performance. His portrayal of Fu Longsheng is chilling, cunning, and nearly unhinged, carried off with great ease. Surprisingly, his action sequences are even more intense and plentiful than Chan's, raising concerns about whether the 67-year-old star could endure such physical demands. Yet whether in action or dialogue, his face-offs with Chan generate riveting tension, especially in three key scenes-the elevator, the market, and the home confrontation-all of which are highlights of the film.

The film also carries forward the aesthetic of ""Hong Kong street realism."" Many pivotal moments unfold in everyday settings: subtle probing in an elevator, psychological sparring in a marketplace, and veiled confrontations over a shared meal. These lived-in details bring the characters vividly to life. The fraught intimacy between Fu Longsheng and his son Xiwang-expressed through a bowl of noodles or the act of shaving-captures the delicate balance of affection and menace in their relationship.

Among the younger cast, Zhang Zifeng avoids being overshadowed. As He Qiuguo, she maintains a strong presence even between heavyweights Chan and Leung, her lively performance showcasing a positive generational handoff.

That said, in films headlined by Jackie Chan, younger actors often struggle to shine. The ""wolf pack of adopted sons,"" touted in the film's promotion, feels underdeveloped. Aside from CiSha, who plays dual roles as Xiwang and Ximeng, other young actors-including Wen Junhui ""Jun of Seventeen"" have little screen time.

One behind-the-scenes detail stands out: Jackie Chan reminding Zhang Zifeng to thank the stunt performers ""No matter what you do, learn to be a good person first."" That off-screen lesson may be the film's most touching moment.

Overall, The Shadow's Edge blends old-school and modern storytelling with down-to-earth human touches. It retains the familiar hallmarks of a Jackie Chan action film while reviving a long-missed sharpness. At over 140 minutes, it does feel a bit overlong-tighter editing could have made it flawless-but the overall experience is exhilarating. A post-credits scene hints at a sequel, and if one comes, I'll be eager to watch. Ultimately, the film's success rests on Larry Yang's skill as both writer and director.",figurative
"Very moving The acting was outstanding, but it was the story that truly moved me. I had no idea Garfield was such a man-and what a timely reminder of the kind of character the office of President deserves. I was deeply touched by his generosity, integrity, humility, and decency. I saw a man who loved his family, loved his country, and simply wanted to do what was right.

But I was also moved by the other man, whose madness drove him to the unthinkable. His was, in its own way, a tragic story-a man with mental illness who could not overcome the wounds of his childhood, who longed to be somebody, to be admired, to make a difference, and who died after a lonely and miserable existence.

There are many good lessons here.",literal
"The 80s fun-fare This sci-fi movie makes me nostalgic. I belong to the 80's brigade. We are probably the only age group to have witnessed the change the technology first hand. Floppies, monitors, those 2d line graphics to the cutting edge technology we see today. I came across this movie while reading Robert Downey Jr's biography. 

Weird Science is over the top, yes, but in a quirky way. The film captures the 80's geeks, fashion, class rivalry & classic fun. The plot is simple. 2 geeks wish they could fit in and rise one up above their rivals. They use technology to create a woman of their dreams. Things are going their way and in the process they are transformed by her . The jokes are crude however some parts of the movie are genuinely funny. 

Bottom-line, don't think too much while watching this movie. Just go with the flow. travel back in time and revel in memories that flood you!",literal
"Wow! This is disturbing, unsettling and really strange. It's brilliant!

They should do all serial killer series like this. Not leaving any detail out at all. Make the audience actually get a look into the minds and reasons of why and how the killer kills.

Evan Peters is fantastic, he played it so well. I saw him as Jeffrey and not as Evan. Every actor was amazing. I'm so impressed with this series.

I never knew how white privilege the whole situation was with Dahmer. It's cringing and disgusting to see what actually happened during his active years.

Very well done! The team that created this, please do more of other psychopaths like this series.",literal
"Couldn't watch it For all the reasons stated in other reviews I turned it off after half an hour. Unfunny, over the top, everyone's a caricature etc etc. Have you ever seen anyone insulted and then thrown out of a hospital for asking to see a patient?! By a nurse apparently! It just doesn't work at all on any level. The actors must have cursed when they read the script and saw what they were supposed to say.",literal
"That is not true. Hamlet is a very old story coming from the Norse legends of Omlodhi. The original story is almost exactly the same with a few changes the Shakespeare made for his time. It was not based on this. It is based on that story. If you don't believe me, search it. Or better yet read Hamlet's Mill. It outlines the history perfectly. Not this garbage of a movie.",literal
"I'm genuinely furious I'm genuinely furious. This film is a full-on disaster for common sense. Everything is absurdly stupid - from the script to the characters' behavior.

There's hardly any plot to speak of. Instead of a coherent story, we get a pathetic excuse for intrigue - something about ""collecting blood samples."" The rest is just empty space, disconnected scenes, and aimless noise. It feels like the writers just gave up, hoping that big names and dinosaurs would carry the film.

But even the dinosaurs are missing. What we get instead are grotesque mutant creatures that inspire neither fear nor awe - only disgust. Where's the grandeur of the ancient world? Where's the spirit of adventure? Everything is drowned in a CGI mess.

And let's not forget the behavior of the main characters. It's not just stupid - it's insulting. It feels like they're competing to see who can make the dumbest decision every minute. Watching it is physically painful.

And then there's the architecture and technology. Are you kidding me? You're on an island full of predators, and everything makes noise - doors bang, systems whir, everything clatters. It's as if the designers intentionally made it easier for dinosaurs to find and eat everyone. Total nonsense.

In conclusion: this film is hollow, annoying, and completely disrespectful to the audience. No plot, no sensible characters, no proper dinosaurs. Just noise, stupidity, and monstrosities. A ""rebirth""... into something much, much worse.",literal
Pilot is so good Very strong pilot episode but Then it loses something its defin Not as good as everyone is praising it to be but some funny moments for sure. Idk why it is rated so high there is nothing too special about this show.,literal
"I need more! A perfectly executed show in every way from start to finish. It humanized Emergency Rooms from so many perspectives. I normally get annoyed having to wait a week in between episodes but I honestly feel bad for anyone who missed that experience with this show. That week in between was necessary and exciting. It's the first show in about 20 years that everyone I know was watching, were ALL caught up at the same time and talking about it. It made me nostalgic for shows of the past that were a common bond for many of us, ER being one of them.

Noah Wiley made the comeback of the century. His emotional range was exceptional and his command of the screen epic. It was a rollercoaster ride to say the least and I loved that every episode was one hour of their shift. Each and every episode ended perfectly...with me wanting more.

Bravo to the casting crew for such a fantastic ensemble of talent. Before I read that the 2nd season is already decided, I was hoping it would pick up exactly where they left off and take us through the night shift. But I know that what they have planned will be great and I'll be watching it.

The only warning I'd have would be that they've taken the realism of surgery and injury to a whole new level. I get squeamish regardless, but I had to cover my eyes quite a bit. Lol

I'm now going to rewatch this back to back to see how it differs.",figurative
"Weighed down by weak lead performance I binged Wayward in a single day because the mystery, Toni Collette's magnetic performance as the academy director, and the phenomenal child actors kept my attention. Unfortunately, the show stumbles where it matters most: the central couple.

Mae Martin, who is non binary and plays Alex, simply doesn't carry the weight this role demands. Their youthful look works in some contexts but makes the marriage to Laura feel more like mother and son than spouses. The lack of believable chemistry is striking, and it drains tension from scenes that should feel emotionally charged.

The problem isn't their identity, it's the performance. Alex is meant to be a grounded, authoritative police officer, but the portrayal feels more like an inexperienced high schooler. Combined with inconsistent character motivations, illogical decisions, and unresolved elements of the academy, these issues undermine the otherwise strong atmosphere. For example, Laura's abrupt behavioral shifts, Alex's questionable choices, and the ambiguous fates of other characters leave significant gaps in the story.

The real standouts are the kids and Toni Collette, who steal every scene and make the series watchable despite its flaws.

Overall, Wayward has style, mystery, and standout supporting performances, but weak acting from the lead and unresolved plot issues prevent it from fully succeeding.",literal
"Sigh... I sometimes wonder if everyone has lost their minds. I'm dumbfounded at the rave reviews this show is getting on this app. What happened to intelligent viewers? Do they not care about quality anymore? Or are they trying to convince themselves this awful show was great? Here's a NO BS review: Nobody Wants This probably should've been a 90-minute film, and ten years ago, this pile of junk would've been a mid-budget theatrical late summer release. Instead, Netflix spread a boring story this thin into ten episodes, which feels like Netflix's cynical ploy to squeeze more dollars out of their ad-based subscription tier. The story also does not reach a resolution; the last few minutes of the finale make it clear the creators are angling for a second season, and why not? It seems no one knows what a great show is anymore. So let's give them more of this junk. Well played, Netflix, well played. You've created an entire generation of mindless viewers.",literal
"Another Taylor Sheridan Hit I figured this would be an entertaining show. We've grown accustomed to think that anything with Stallone in it nowadays would be a comedy, and Tulsa King does feature good amount of humor. But Taylor Sheridan isn't going to create a simple parody of a mob story and using Stallone as a joke and punchline.

The show has promising depth, despite the light-hearted premise of a former big shot mobster forced to make a new start in a new city after a long prison sentence. Some comedy ensues as a New York mobster finds his way around Tulsa to establish his turf using his ""old world"" ways.

Characters are genuinely likable across the board. While it's not unusual to root for a ""bad"" guy as the protagonist, his directness and old world commonsense values appeal to those of us looking for something refreshing amidst today's social nonsense. Irony in the message is that it takes a thug who bows down to no one to smash through and expose the shallow social hypocrisy. This is the same formula that made Yellowstone such a success, and Sheridan knows this is what so many of us want.

Stallone gives an excellent performance. Before he became a caricature from his later roles that drove Rocky and Rambo franchises into the ground, his acting and screen presence created those iconic roles. It's good to see him back on screen in a role that seems perfect for him, and leverage some of that cheeky persona to add depth to his character and the show, rather than undermine it.

Overall, highly entertaining show that I look forward to, and an excellent addition to Paramount+ portfolio.",figurative
"I think This show is a hit right out of the park! LOVE IT I have missed the quirky very Steve Martin/ Martin Short type of upbeat comedy that was so popular in the late 1980s-2000 and have found myself really missing it....until....

HERE IT IS AGAIN!

A little off-beat, a lot witty with some New York style sarcasm thrown in, this show is a murder-mystery in an apartment building with three strangers and nothing is as it appears on the surface.

NUFF said about the PLOT.

The acting is Steve Martin. Classic Steve Martin. Who remains fabulous. And Martin Short. Also always a winner. Selena Gomes is a fun addition to their act. Highly talented and quite enjoyable.

"Stallone is back Not too many new shows are this well written. Taylor Sheridan knocks it out of the park. First episode in and it's already one of the best series. Stallone is better than ever and he was made for this role. His acting is dead on he never misses. Always been a fan since Rocky and Rambo and a few others. Creed 2 showed he's a Hollywood contender but some of his recent movies have been really bad especially Samaritan. Acting was horrible and the movie was just a dumpster fire. He totally redeems himself here with one episode of Tulsa King. It's gritty, funny, and the mix of light action and drama is perfect. Don't miss it.",figurative
"Was a great show... until it wasn't When this show first started, I loved it~. It was funny.. almost reminded me of a really degenerated version of Rosanne.

The lower class lives of a sister and brother taking on the responsibility of younger siblings. It's raunchy sometimes, it's funny at all the times, and it's realistic to a world where getting by is a daily struggle.

The second to last season was going down hill and by the last season, I couldn't even watch it. The masks in a tv series was the last thing I wanted to relax and enjoy my evening after working. It ruined the entire series... these were defiant misfits, always going against the grain of what is acceptable in society. To mask up was against every principal of this family and I just couldn't watch it.

"Fantastic performances in this riveting historical drama I knew very little about President Garfield's rise and his short term in the nation's highest office. While this tragic turn of events happened more than 140 years ago, the story holds great relevance today, as our country grapples with a growing mental health crisis, gun violence and disinformation. The performances, costumes and set design swept me away to another time, but the story is strangely modern and relatable, given our current climate. I binged it in one night.",literal
"Healthy relationship who? I feel like the only people who could possibly enjoy this trash are those who have never had a healthy relationship. I agree with Drew Gooden. The plot and main characters are infuriating. At what point are either of them in a position to be redeemed and thus ""rooted for?""",literal
"Selena Gomez ruined it for me It's very well made, just that Ms Gomez's horrible acting ruins it every time she is on. Forget about the dialogue delivery, get expressionless face makes the series unwatchable.",literal
"I drank the koolaid and liked it I went to the IMAX to see this film, one of the few films I have actively sat down to watch with purpose.

I wasnt expecting a lot because I have been to so many films with high praise and been utterly dissapointed by it. 2hr 40mins, christ this was a commitment,

The film was great, I watched the entire thing and it didnt feel like nearly 3 hours, not once did I get bored or think ""that scene was a bit indulgent you could of scrapped 10mins off this film""

Dont get me wrong, could this film be 2hrs long? YES. Just for the general convienance of my day to day life, this film however is not for the general public to sit while they scroll with their phones in the background. It is an experience, it put my faith back into cinema.

The only depressing part of this all was this script was over 10 years in development, it cost 150million to make. I feels like this film is the comforting hand on the shoulder to tell us that our beloved cinema has died.

Long are the days where the DVD market could support these kind of films, where our indie film market thrived. This is a love letter for those who dream, for the cinephile to enjoy a real cinematic experience, but sadly these stories are few and fading.",literal
Wicked for Good. A tale of two friends crossing paths. I thought this movie was fabulous. Jon M. Chu stunning telling is awesome. Wicked for good has transcend on another level from Wicked from the growth each cast member go through to the emotional songs make you feel. The costume designs are amazing and visual effects stunning. Cynthia Erivo takes aback while Ariana Grande takes the wheel in emotional performance and builds a new Oz for generations and generations to come.,literal
"Warm, Funny, and Easy - A Ted Lasso for the Football Field From the very first episode, Chad Powers hooked me with its humor and heart. It's a rare mix of absurdity and warmth - the kind of show that makes you laugh out loud one minute and genuinely root for the characters the next. The story of a disgraced quarterback disguising himself just to get another shot at the game sounds ridiculous on paper, but the show turns it into something surprisingly heartfelt.

Glenn Powell's comedy timing is spot-on - he sells both the ridiculous disguise and the sincere emotion underneath. His performance gives the series its charm and makes the humor land perfectly.

It's an easy, feel-good watch with no filler or pointless subplots. The tone is perfectly balanced - part sports comedy, part redemption story. It feels like a more down-to-earth, heartwarming Ted Lasso with a Southern football twist.

Sure, it doesn't dive too deep or reinvent anything, but that's not what it's trying to do. It's light, funny, and full of heart - exactly the kind of show that leaves you smiling when the credits roll.",literal
"Please bring back more great seasons of........... 1. The Wire ..........& 2. Major Crimes I really liked Missy Peregrym in her previous telvision crime/drama series (2010/2015) Rookie Blue, and there certainly is some decent on-screen chemistry with her current co-star Zeeko Zaki who recently appeared in the military/drama TV series (2017) Six. If this new TV series FBI is to not only survive but in fact thrive, the writers need to be a heck of a lot more creative with the storylines than just bring us one hour episodes about ISIS related criminals who simply just get shot dead by FBI agents in an effort to end the episode.

I have to ask myself where are the writers who created the fantastic and in-depth storylines of the hit crime series The Wire, and/or Major Crimes? Bring back these great TV crime series and please STOP generating shallow and boring shoot em up crime series that rely more on irritating suspenseful music scores in an attempt to keep our attention. It simply just won't work.

I give FBI an encouraging 5 out of 10 rating in an effort to influence the producers to hire some more creative writers, otherwise this series will die faster than their next ISIS storyline.",literal
"Mr Frog for President So I finally got around to watching Smiling Friends and it's unironically funny. Definitely one of the best adult cartoons in recent years as the characters are all incredibly bizarre and unhinged, I enjoyed the voice acting and how natural the line delivery is. I love the Animation of the show and how creative it can be, plus the different styles that are used from 2D, 3D, rotoscope, stop motion, even live action really adds to the main art style of the show, but the context of everything in each episode is bizarre to say the least. Each episode usually focuses on a character that the Smiling friends need to make smile through any means even if things get out of hand very quickly. Definitely my favorite characters are Mr. From, Boss and Allen though Pin and Charlie are also up there too. Favorite episode has to be ""A Allan Adventure"" with the plot being that Allen has to get paper clips and goes on an entire chase just to get them at the end with the Animation being insanely good for no apparent reason. If you enjoy a series with both a unique yet bizarre art style, plus an adult cartoon that's actually funny, than I highly recommend you watch Smiling Friends.",figurative
Fantastic animation all around I hope adultswim picks this up. I'm a long time huge fan of Zach and Michael.,literal
"Brilliant Well shot and well formed script. Bill Skarsgard did a fantastic job as Pennywise. You'll float too scene was just brilliant, as was the opening scene with Georgie. The reality of IT being dependant on the children's belief and fear of IT taps into what we know as reality. 

I thought this film was fantastic. I did think the film could have been creepier and even darker, but maybe Chapter Two will dive beyond the abyss.

Overall I would say definitely see this film if you are a fan of the Tim Curry version or a general horror film fan.",literal
"Jurassic World Rebirth Review! 🏆60%

I went into this movie not expecting it to be great but still having a good time, and that's kind of what I got, but weirdly I still feel slightly disappointed. I don't really know why. It's not great, but I still enjoyed watching it in the theater. That was my original expectation, so I don't know why I feel slightly disappointed still. I guess I was just hoping it would've been just slightly better. The plot of the movie is that our group of characters needs to get blood samples of three different types of dinosaurs. The plot itself doesn't sound bad, and I didn't really have that many issues with that part of the movie. Something that I did have a problem with was the family. Why are they in this movie? What did they contribute to the film? Absolutely nothing. If you were to remove those four characters from the movie, nothing would've changed. The only reason they're in the film is to make it longer. All their scenes are pretty much filler. It's literally a side quest, but I do have to mention, Dolores was absolutely adorable. Easily the most adorable dinosaur we've seen in the franchise. She didn't need to be in the movie, but who cares? She's adorable. Anyway, the thing that I guess made me disappointed after walking out of the theater was probably the stuff with the D-Rex. At the beginning of the movie, they set up the D-Rex and show how he escapes, but he didn't appear again until the end of the movie, and when he did appear again, not much really happened. He killed three people, but 2 of them he killed were people we didn't even know, and the other guy he killed was just an a-hole. Speaking of the D-Rex killing people, there's a scene that felt surprisingly pretty good and impactful. One of our main characters sacrifices himself to save the others by leading the D-Rex away from them. In the scene, it makes you believe that he dies there. The scene was actually kinda good, until they revealed that he actually survived. How did he survive? Who knows! The movie doesn't really explain how he escaped that giant dinosaur that was literally right in his face just a second ago. Also, once we get close towards the end of the movie, the area they're in just gets power again right out of nowhere, even though the place has likely been powerless for over 17 years. Why did this happen? The movie doesn't really explain how that could've happened, just an amazing coincidence, I guess. Yeah, this movie is a mess, but it's a fun mess. Even with how dumb it is, I still found myself enjoying the movie. It's just dumb fun. I doubt I'll ever watch it again, but who knows, maybe I might rewatch it whenever the sequel comes out. Overall, this movie is definitely not good, but it's still a fun time at the movies, and just because of that, I'll be a little more generous with my rating!",literal
"Hauntingly Beautiful I was hesitant about going to see Frankenstein at TIFF (the plan was to wait until it hit cinemas) but I'm so glad I did. Thanks to a lovely friend I got tickets to the premiere!

It's a stunning and layered film-the details! A Beautifully shot gothic tale. A technical and visual masterpiece that deserves to be seen on the big screen. You can feel the love and passion del Toro poured into the film.

It honours Mary Shelley's story while adding that distinct Guillermo del Toro stamp. It reminded me of both The Shape of Water and Crimson Peak, and because of that think it's going to be a divisive film.

Jacob Elordi is the standout star of the film. His portrayal of the Monster made my heart ache. Heartbreakingly beautiful and just simply phenomenal acting from him.

I wish they could have explored the connection between Elizabeth and the Monster more. However, it's definitely one of my favourites of the festival so far. I can't wait to see it again.",figurative
"Determination From the makers of beloved twisted Christmas movie Rare Exports comes Sisu.

I was able to see Sisu at the U. S. Premier at the Florida Film Festival 2023.

If you pay close attention you will recognize some of the same actors from Rare Exports, most notably the father and the son.

Sisu is a violent, gory, feel good movie all about one man's determination to keep a hold of his well earned prize with his dog in tow.

The main character has isolated himself in a remote part of Lapland during WWII, where the Nazi's have begun a scorched earth policy and we follow his journey through this desolate land.

Highly recommended, funny, fast paced.",figurative
"Excellent! OMG! Did. Not. Disappoint.

I'm obsessed and I need more! The MC's had great chemistry. Probably one of the best shows that has aired this year. Made my heart flutter a few times. The storyline is different, I love that they added, a sibling relationship, future in law's relationship. They all have developing storylines that leave us intrigued and wanting more. You can really tell it's a quality production and very well thought. I will recommend this to all my friends and coworkers. I can't say enough good thing la about this show. Super excited to see Kristen Bell on the screen again. WE NEED A SEASON 2!",literal
"Setting a new bar for quality in television This show is the natural evolution of Breaking Bad's style in the best way possible. It is without a doubt one of the greatest television shows of all time.

It's difficult to maintain objectivity while discussing this series. Few other shows come so close to perfection. Every single facet of the production is flawless; it's practically a case study on how to make good TV.

Better Call Saul's script is near Shakespearean, effortlessly walking the line between tragedy and acid wit. Characters leap out of the screen as nearly every cast member delivers a career-best performance. The writers nimbly dodge the typical pitfalls found in prequel works, forcing us to care about characters whose fates we already know while building suspense around those we don't. Sparks fly as new and old characters come face-to-face unexpectedly, adding fresh context and weight to both series.

Despite its intrinsic connection to Breaking Bad, BCS carves out its own stylistic identity with ease. The show is downright bursting with color and motion. Quiet conversations and flashy montages alike provide a feast for the eyes, with every shot positively dripping detail and symbolism. As expected, Dave Porter's soundtrack provides a perfect backdrop for every scene. Brilliant camera work drives the whole production, turning even the most mundane settings into kaleidoscopic sensory treats. This show magnetically draws the attention of everyone in the room like no other.

Above all else, Better Call Saul feels complete. This is a show that clearly had an ending in mind as early as season 1. The finished product is so wholly realized that every scene feels essential, laying the foundation for what comes later while rhyming with what came before. It's less a series and more a portrait, meant to be viewed as a whole from infinite perspectives with each fresh angle providing a new experience for the audience.

If you're at all serious about good television, you owe it to yourself to watch BCS. It's an instant classic and a timeless entry in the cinematic canon. Vince Gilligan and company deserve a blank check for whatever comes next.",figurative
Unlikable Characters It's hard to watch this series on wealth privilege because the characters don't seem to have any redeeming qualities. I love Connie Britton but even her character is hard to watch. Shut it down midway through the second episode. I really couldn't watch it anymore to find out who redeems themselves.,literal
"It's better than average, but only slightly! I went into this movie expecting big things. Now, the singers were great, and I can't deny the cast's talent, but as far as the timing and pacing of the film, it gets a significant deduction in stars for me.

I don't love musicals, but having written that, I can't say that these productions are something I automatically shy away from.

Three hours is a helluva long time to listen to and watch a movie with so much singing and nearly no dialogue outside of song lyrics.

To its credit, Wicked is shot cleanly and beautifully, and the balance of singing and character acting gets better, in my opinion, in the second half of the movie.",literal
"Removed a star with almost every season Tried to stick it out until the end but just can't do it any longer. I'm not interested in politics - I watch to be entertained, not irritated. The characters all sound the same, have the same emotions, expressions, and attitudes. The writing is terrible. The whole COVID season (2020-2021) is depressing and insulting. I'm done. I should have quit many seasons ago.",literal
"Superior Series It's pretty original for a TV series. ""Law and Order"" is the proper title because the first half has a pair of cops investigating a crime and the second half shows us the DA's office prosecuting the wrong-doers. The writers seem to know something about their subject too, which is a refreshing change. I can't count the number of humdrum police series in which the officers refer to the perpetrators as ""crooks"" and use other lingo lifted straight out of comic books. This one is different. The cops deal with criminals matter-of-factly, shoving them around once in a while, but shrugging and wisecracking over corpses. And the episodes stick to their subject, without dragging in a lot of time-consuming personal problems and dreary romances. There's very little in the way of a musical score -- mainly that sforzando PLONK PLONK of a chord when there's a significant change in scene.

Of course the show has been going on for many years and there have been a lot of cast changes. It's important because we get to spend a lot of time with the two investigating detectives and the two or three people in the DA's office, so, over time, we get to know them rather well.

Some of the cast changes has been improvements. As the police lieutenant, S. Epatha Merkerson is probably better than Dann Florek, who appeared in the earlier episodes. As the Assistant DA in charge of the cases, Michael Moriarty and Sam Waterston are equally good. As their chief assistant, Richard Brooks was replaced (to good effect) by a series of babes: Jill Hennessey, Cary Lowell, Angie Harmon, and Elizabeth Roehm. The assistants that followed were barely adequate.

The original detective team was George Dzundza and Christopher Noth and both were fine. Dzundza was replaced by Paul Sorvino and then Jerry Orbach, both equally good. I can't imagine why Chris Noth was let go (suddenly and without warning) because he seemed ideal in the part.

The stories haven't declined in quality much, but the signs of exhaustion are apparent. Earlier episodes were often borrowed from real-life high-profile cases and it was interesting to watch them spun out in fictional form. And they tended to reflect what anyone would think to be the experiences of ordinary detectives. The plots took the cops into the ghettos and crummy back alleys and louche places where junkies and miscreants hung out. And, again, both the characters and settings were convincingly projected. That's changed. More often now the cops work in middle-class or high-end milieus, as if the show itself were losing touch with its roots.

And, to an extent, it is getting lost. It jumped the shark a few years ago, after Jerry Orbach left the cast. No satisfactory replacement has been found. Too many of the cast are beginning to look like rich actors rather than like the characters they play.

Lately, my impression is that, like all systems, it suffers from creeping entropy in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics. From it has sprung forth so many spinoffs that the format is finally feeding on its own flesh. I don't bother watching the show any longer. And I always wished that the producer, Dick Wolf, would have ditched that corny wolf howl at the end of each show.

At it's best, though, ""Law and Order"" is one of the most gripping and convincing police shows that has appeared on TV.",literal
"A Disney gem. With a strong female lead Moana is a story with great songs and even greater visuals. In the colorful environment Moana is joined by Maui, who is expertly casted as Dwayne Johnson. The Cultures from the New Zealand area is shown in the story with respect, most of the voice actors are in fact from the New Zealand area. Unfortunately it is not flawless. One of the first challenges the two must overcome, I found a bit useless. And I did not care for the cave scene and song. However I understand why it was used. I would definitely recommend the movie.",figurative
"Average at best This is not necessarily a bad show by any means, the stories are ok, the casting is ok and the acting is ok, see where I am going with this... it's ok. Here's why it's just ok, it doesn't do anything new, the idea that someone joins up with the police and uses their gift / ability to solve cases that the police can't, yep, we are officially out of ideas now and so we get an offering like this. Nothing makes this show stand out or feel new, it's been done so many times before and it's been done better. I have no problem with it being cheesy and over the top but sometimes it's just straight up absurd and that's where it looses me. The character herself is somewhat annoying at times and quite honestly as much as I love her in always sunny, I just don't feel that this is the show for her. Also I feel like the show is strange mix of genres, one minute it is serious and emotional, the next it's just plain comedy and other times it does have that mystery feel and I think that's a problem also, pick a genre type and stick to it. This show feels all over the place.",literal
"Death by Lightning - A Must-Watch Historical Drama Death by Lightning - A Must-Watch Historical Drama

""Death by Lightning"" is not just entertaining - it's electrifying. This series proves that television can be both thrilling and enlightening, blending gripping storytelling with fascinating history. It's the kind of show that makes you lean forward, eager to catch every detail, while also sneaking in lessons about a pivotal moment in American politics.

The concept is bold, the acting superb, and the narrative flows with a mix of suspense and authenticity. Set in a time when integrity carried weight and life seemed simpler, the series reminds us that politics has always been complex, messy, and deeply human.

What makes it shine is its balance: you're entertained, but you're also learning. It's history brought to life - not in a dusty textbook way, but in a vivid, cinematic style that keeps you hooked.

I especially love that it's a limited series. No dragging storylines, no endless cliffhangers - just a complete, satisfying arc that leaves you with closure. For anyone who enjoys historical dramas, political intrigue, or simply great television, this is a must-watch.

⭐ Highly recommended for viewers who want to be entertained while gaining insight into the short-lived presidency that shaped a chapter of history.",figurative
"On the surface brilliant, but dig deeper and... So i've recently come back to this show after having last watched it around 2012 and although it is, on the surface at least, a funny show, it you even remotely concentrate on the goings on, something becomes all too apparent.

This show and Friends work off the same principle, that being - All the characters are toxic, insecure and neurotic.

The entire run of the show is about people constantly looking to get one over everyone else. They're constantly looking to put eachother down at every turn, while looking to assert that they, and their work is far superior to everyone else.

Even once they start entering relationships, all the relationship becomes is a battle for dominance. Each character looks to belittle their partner, while looking to be the dominant one in the relationship even to the point that they'll try to sabotage their partners career just so they can then heap sympathy upon them thereby (for the time being, at least) assert dominance.

They all start arguments out of absolutely nothing. One might say they have a job interview, the other will then make a big deal out of not having been told about said job interview, which then leads to utterly pointless(forced) dialogue which is simply painful to the ears. This always results in the one with the interview saying they won't go, while the other (allegedly) see's the error of their ways an insists they go to the interview, but only if they want to and that nothing will change regardless of what they decide to do. It all gets needlessly contrived.

How any of these characters (in either Friends or TBBT) are friends or married is the biggest mystery of all. If you were to encounter these people on a night out the negative energy emitting from them would open a portal to Hell. They are some of the most toxic and ultimately unlikeable characters in TV history.

The show does though have some genuinely funny moments, but just be sure to switch the brain off while watching it.",literal
"Love so much! Very stylish more disturbing, amazing soundtrack and satisfying sequel! Probably my only complaint was I had to sit near a heavy guy with loud breathing otherwise great experience.

"Soooo Good...! Directed by Tim Burton... Music by Danny Elfan... The look of the frame, the acting and story all remind me of the two now classic 90s Adam's Family Feature Films... Wednesday was my favourite character in the films, especially the second one when she and Pugsley got sent to Summer Camp...

Christina Ricci in those films as Wednesday was floorless, and it was great to see her appear in this too. Ortega's turn as the main character was excellent she is quickly becoming a great actress. I think you need to give the series time to develop and remember that it's target audience is quite wide, I don't think it's meant to be too dark. Just like the 90s films it plays on the dark and morbid humour, but with the teen angst mixed in.

Definitely worth watching if you are intrigued, but remember that it's not an 18+ rated adult only tale... it's a modern tale on these ever classic characters, think along the lines of the Netflix Sabrina series... If you liked that, then this should be right up your alley.",literal

"Nobody 2 - I recommend it to nobody 2. And here's why. From the very first scene, you know exactly how it's going to go: one man, armed with a gun or a stick, will take down dozens of trained soldiers without so much as a scratch. Suspense? None.

Humor? Missing.

Credibility? Gone.

In the first film, Odenkirk and his father being unstoppable was already pushing it... but when this ""superpower"" starts spreading to characters with zero connection to their world, it gets flat-out embarrassing.

The plot feels like it was written in grade school: no context, no atmosphere, no growth-just one absurd episode after another. Every scene is so predictable you can call it before it happens... and you'll always be right.

If you want over-the-top, logic-free action, there are countless better options in the genre. Watching Bob Odenkirk-Saul Goodman himself-wasted on such an empty script is just painful.

Nobody 2? I recommend it to nobody 2.

Your turn - did you like it, or is it a hard pass?",literal
"Good, decent mystery I noticed something very odd about it. Starting with the art construction of homes and unusual decor. Gravel in the driveway when they were supposed to be in Boston.

The storyline was pretty good. It seems a little predictable to me. However I think it's still worth watching",literal
"A breath of fresh air among modern horror First and foremost I want to say that weapons doesn't pull any fast ones on you as the audience. It's not gimmicky and doesn't use superficial horror cliches to reel you in. What weapons does pull off is a unique but hard to execute narration style, an unsettling mystery, and an incredible payoff in the final act. With that in mind let's talk about it.

Becoming and staying invested in a film is often a difficult task but weapons tackled it perfectly. Right from the start this films plot mystery has you asking important questions such as who? How? Why? These questions are answered but in a satisfying slowly pulling the curtain back sort of manner. However before any answers are revealed the stakes become more urgent forcing a change in pace. As the plot progresses we switch from different people of interest seeing the same events played back through their point of view. Not only is this a unique filming method but i thought it was an entertaining way to gain new story insight. The original investment came from the mystery but staying invested will be this film gradually bottle feeding you the full extent of horror taking place. I also thought the films foreshadowing of a supernaturally sinister being was a nice addition. These things alone kept me intrigued and observant of where the plot was going. Something else to mention, I think weapons is strong as a whole. However, I thought the third act had some of the most satisfying payoff horrors had to offer in a while. With all that in mind I do have few gripes with weapons. Theres definitely moments in this film that I felt like didn't progress the plot and were included for no other reason then to add runtime. These same scenes seem to be excused as pertinent to character dynamics but I wasn't buying it.

Overall, weapons isn't perfect and could use some more plot progression moments to further engagement. However putting that aside it's an accomplishment in the horror/mystery genre. From its unique premise and switching points of view to its uncanny foreshadowing. Weapons is as entertaining as it is satisfying to watch unfold before you.",figurative
