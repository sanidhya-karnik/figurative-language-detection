Given his weird machismo and oddly homosexual actions as well as the penchant for powerful rich guys to delude themselves into thinking that having sex with other men is somehow more straight than banging a chick I'm 100% certain he's the way he is because he was raised to be a violent sexually repressed psychopath.

There's also ample evidence his administration knew 9/11 would happen and didn't take action.

That's a ridiculously huge number but just for the sake of argument all allow it. 100 staff members needed before January is 0.002 percent of the amount of resumes he's received. Are you really suggesting that he should not use AI to disqualify the resumes that clearly do not meet requirements? Because doing so would bring that number way down to a reasonable amount that you can vet by hand. If that's the case that alone proves you are not arguing in good faith.,literal,Argumentative discussion with mathematical reasoning - direct language
190,Not sure where you got any of your information but it's basically all false. AI is so much more than just LLM companies trying to sell you a chat bot. Every single sector of the economy is integrating AI into it. I've been designing and building supercomputers for a very long time and this AI craze is nothing new it's not unique at all. Like I have mentioned in other replies every single sector is using AI in some way or another right now with huge success. Everything from the hyperscalers and tech giants all the way down to grocery stores and gas stations. HPC has been around for a long time and GPU's were slowly adopted over decades with recent advancements in software exploding the usefulness of CUDA and other similar alternatives. Machine learning finally hit a critical mass to be broadly applicable in every single sector... it's not gonna go away unless something better replaces it.,metaphor,Critical mass is physics metaphor for threshold; hit is metaphor for reached
191,You are right of course. But it's so much deeper. You need to understand there is no actual average voter only targeted segments. And those segments get their information from segmented channels. Or: it's perfectly reasonable for two different voting segments to hear two different things from the same candidate on completely different channels. Combine that with Trump's promise everything to everybody approach .. and the actual awareness of most voters .. and you have something that's obvious to us that isn't obvious to them.,literal,Political analysis explanation - direct language

Halligan is not only insanely out-of-her-depth she's confident too. Hoo boy pass the popcorn.,metaphor,Out-of-her-depth is metaphor for unqualified; pass the popcorn is metaphor for watching drama unfold
194,I'd call it the dot com bubble with a bit of Beanie Babies in it and a bit of the e and i era of prefixes. Lots of spending on what could be not will be and throwing money at it if it whispers AI while putting AI in every name or product to make it look new and cutting edge. While the actual products will probably die and any surviving ones will rebrand.,metaphor,Bubble is economic metaphor; throwing money is metaphor for spending; whispers is personification metaphor; die is metaphor for failing

202,By Martha McHardy — US News Reporter | A clear majority of voters would choose a Democrat candidate for Congress if the midterms were held today a new poll shows. The PBS News/NPR/Marist survey conducted between November 10 and 13 revealed that 55 percent of voters would elect a Democratic candidate compared to 41 percent who would opt for a Republican. The 14-point lead for the Democrats is the party's largest since November 2017. In 2018 during Trump's first term the Democrats won more than 40 seats in the House of Representatives in the midterm elections.,literal,News article with polling data and statistics
203,This. Why is Google plugging the same b.s. article (posted by different sources) lying about IRS confirmation of Trump's $2k stimulus? Yesterday my Chrome homepage suggested this link and today it's been recycled with a new source.

207,There was one celeb that did come out and say that they were in the flight logs but were innocent. I think it was Chris Tucker. He's the only one that I've heard mention anything about not being involved in the pedo ring. He was with Bill Clinton and Kevin Spacey for an AIDS/HIV epidemic summit so not the best company to be with lol,literal,Direct recounting of facts and personal observation

That arms shipment or troop transport is probably gonna be at X spot between station A and B right about now. Be a shame if something were to happen to it right on time.,irony,Ironic reversal of fascist talking point about trains running on time - sarcastic it would be a shame

224,She was invisible for most of Biden's term the dems skipped the primary and pushed Biden as the re-running candidate then decided last second that actually Kamala should be the dem frontrunner. Democrat voters never got to choose. We were told who to vote for and that's not really what Democrat voters like.,metaphor,Invisible is metaphor for having low profile; pushed is metaphor for promoted

232,I'm not talking at all about the past or denying that Dems like Schumer and Biden and Pelosi long overstayed their due and have repeatedly fucked up and disappointed. But the conversation was about what the Dems (any of them) can do moving forward. I'm genuinely asking what Dems can actually do to stop the GOP's agenda now. What exactly are people wanting or expecting? But with regards to this: If the Dems just did X (hold firm on the shutdown not conceding to a handshake deal on extending healthcare subsidies force Mike Johnson to swear in Grijalva before agreeing to end the shutdown force an emergency full funding on SNAP benefits while in shutdown and not accept any concessions until Republicans agree to those terms) then they could stop certain aspects of the GOP's agenda. What would that actually look like? How could the Dems force Johnson and the GOP to make those sizable concessions when those people were perfectly fine continuing the shutdown? Everyone's disappointed with how it ended but I'm not sure how else it would have ended unless we're counting on Republicans to suddenly develop empathy and compassion.,literal,Political analysis and questioning - direct argumentation
233,I think everyone saw this coming whether out of incompetence or maliciousness or both but even as a cynic I expected a little more skill and preparation than this. Comey has an all star legal team but this glaring breach of procedure seems like something a public defender would've caught.,metaphor,All star is sports metaphor for excellent; glaring is metaphor for obvious
234,Leave people's relationships alone. How is this about politics. It should be removed,literal,Direct opinion about content relevance
235,The democrat side isn't as bad as the GOP but still have issues. It's beyond gross that information on what the Rep did is so far down this thread and the top three or four comments don't even bother reading the article and just assume mtg is mental. This was a backroom deal to protect two slimy reps one on each side. We shouldn't be cheering this whatsoever. Learn that the Democrats are NOT your friends or allies but simply more useful than the GOP.,metaphor,Backroom deal is metaphor for secret negotiation; slimy is metaphor for unethical
236,Also when he was running he actually asked people to stop donating because he had reached the donation cap. Which just feels very honest. I'm glad he's up front and not ashamed to ask for the help he needs. This is an excellent example. Community helps each other - he is the member of his community and not grandfathered in by rich folks of the system. He is asking his neighbors for help. I don't know we all need that energy. When you receive from your community it bolsters you to give to it. The people want him there and I'm sure they'll help him do what it takes to get the job done and we will see if he does the same for them. I firmly hope he does!,metaphor,Grandfathered in is idiom/metaphor for being included through legacy; bolsters is metaphor for strengthens

239,In my fairly extensive experience working with lawyers: anything that needs to get done by lower level associates or legal researchers gets done super fast because the whole culture for those folks is working 80 hour weeks to try to get ahead. Anything that needs to get done by older guys and partners takes absolutely forever because they put in their time and are rich and barely do any work anymore. Things like disbarring is a panel of old dudes so yeah good luck getting them to come off the golf course for an hour zoom meeting once a month to talk about it.,literal,Personal observation about legal profession work culture - direct language
240,I'm concerned the GOP will go to SCOTUS to protect their gains via the courts who will still be fully captured. They can carve out a wide double standard. We're seeing the conservative judges possibly not rolling back the tariffs because of how difficult it would be and that argument can be applied elsewhere. We broke this so badly that it can't be easily fixed stop the Democrats from trying!,metaphor,Captured is metaphor for controlled; carve out is metaphor for creating
241,They have to first scrub all the references to Trump and his pedo buddies and replace them all with Bill Clinton,metaphor,Scrub is metaphor for remove or clean

249,The problem is that everyone--EVERYONE--said the same thing during the housing bubble recovery. What ended up happening is both the Democrats and Republicans made a big show of grandstanding and yelling at Big Bank and then they punished these banks by taking on billions of dollars of worthless MBSs that they still haven't offloaded. 30% of the entire market of MBS are owned by the US Government as a result of bailouts. As a reminder prior to 2008 the US Government owned roughly 0% of all mortgage backed securities. So basically ever since the bailout--where these banks should have failed and been replaced by banks that manage money better--the US Government rewarded all these banks with a means to take exceptional risk while having a guaranteed safety net.,metaphor,Big show is metaphor for performance; punished in quotes suggests ironic use
250,The Supreme Court's most recent major ruling on racial gerrymandering was Alexander v. South Carolina State Conference of the NAACP in May 2024 which made it significantly harder for plaintiffs to prove racial gerrymandering in court. In May 2024 the Supreme Court issued a 6-3 decision in Alexander v. South Carolina State Conference of the NAACP largely in favor of the state's map. The conservative majority ruled that if a redistricting map can be explained by political motivations federal courts cannot intervene even if it also results in a racial disparity.,literal,Legal case summary and ruling explanation - factual

Ukraine gave away their nukes for guaranteed territorial integrity both Russia and the US agreed to respect it and see where that went. They tariff us on a daily basis anyhow. Might as well make it worth our while.,literal,Direct opinion comment with crude language
403,Important to view this as a Witkoff plan until we know any different. It is not clear at this stage if Trump was even on board. In fact there are some indications he might not have been. Certainly hard to believe the adults in the room — Rubio Kellogg — were in the loop. Is Witkoff just an incompetent moron or is stirring the pot his job?,metaphor,Adults in the room is metaphor for responsible parties; stirring the pot is metaphor for creating controversy
404,Look at the first world war. Look at world war 2. Look at any major war in history. You will notice the disproportionate amount of deaths one or several sides have. The UN was created because if a third big one kicks off there will once again be millions of deaths disproportionate affecting one or several sides. Also ceasefires have never had a requirement to be proportional either. Its why india and Pakistan can heat up and go back to the status quo occasionally. Once again war being destructive and the losses inflicting being disproportionately is why war should be avoided,metaphor,Kicks off is metaphor for starts; heat up is metaphor for escalate
405,Making a deal with the devil. This will come back to haunt us.,metaphor,Devil is metaphor for evil entity; haunt is metaphor for cause future problems

You going to trust a terrorist Show me proof that the retaliation was bombarding and killing hundreds of civilians (you wont show me this) Show me proof of the continuing airstrikes that werent a retaliation to a terrorist attack. Show me these outside observers and these documents of 1000+ violations. It is understandable because you are writing lies,literal,Argumentative challenge requesting evidence - direct language

409,well sadly Russia israel and ukraine does it currently,literal,Direct factual statement
410,I mean this whole article is according to the IDF. So if you haven't trusted them before I'm not sure why'd you'd treat this article as fact.,literal,Direct critical observation about source credibility

414,How we have the right to say anything is crazy I get we GAVE $$$ but man where the fuck do these folks get it in their heads they got a bone in this. Our nation will definitely fall because of greed especially w no checks in place. We are owned my foreign entities and our políticas have no back bone do inside trading are freaks when they get together apparently but want to control what folks be doing (grinder be crash lol) and would lie w a hand on the Bible when sworn no shame in lying......,metaphor,Got a bone is idiom for having stake in; fall is metaphor for collapse; no back bone is metaphor for lacking courage
415,Russia can Never be trusted.. For the last 1000 years Russia has invaded neighboring countries stolen the land and brutalized the populations. Russia is a cancer.,metaphor,Cancer is metaphor for destructive disease

417,Bukhari came out 200 years after the Quran. Most Muslims especially those raised in or who live in western countries focus on the Quran itself and don't follow the hadiths (ie Bukhari). The Muslims who believe the Hadiths are more similar to Orthodox or Hasidic Jews. Most Muslims are like the average Jewish person in that sense. The average Jewish person doesn't agree with most of what the Orthodox or Hasidic Jews believe is mandatory.,literal,Religious explanation with comparisons - factual

420,I know if I keep trying to argue away the concerns of the world they will see Isreal in a better light. What these conversations always feel like. 1500 buildings destroyed since the ceasefire based on BBC satellite analysis. You want people to believe Israeli government claims. Journalists have to be let in. If you want people to grow more distrustful of Isreal keep on keeping on.,literal,Direct argumentative statement with data

423,Maybe the massive country two doors down that has explicitly stated their intention to destroy Israel? The two bordering nations that to this day refuse to sign a peace treaty with Israel? Who harbor proxies that threaten Israel?,literal,Rhetorical questions stating facts
424,It's a moot point. The war can't be ended by getting people into a room and hammering out a compromise. It must be fought until there's a decisive conclusion on the ground. At that time the parties can horse-trade territory or whatever. The only exception--which is likely but undesirable--is for the war to reach a stalemate. In that case it becomes a frozen conflict ala the Korean War. It would be much better for the US and Europe to back Ukraine until the Russians have to quit. That doesn't mean Ukraine gets all of its pre-2014 territory back however. Ukraine giving up weapons is bad not only for Ukraine but also for Europe/NATO. The country has one of the biggest (if not the biggest) military in Europe. NATO and the EU need it.,metaphor,Hammering out is metaphor for negotiating; horse-trade is metaphor for bargaining; frozen conflict is metaphor for stalemate; back is metaphor for support
425,They exist in ceasefires and they exist in wars. The only time you ignore proportionality is if you believe the other side is less than human historically.,literal,Direct statement about proportionality
426,None of this screed addresses the notion that Europe is one of the major sources of funding for Russia's war in Ukraine and that they've failed to rise to the threat of Russian revanchism. I wasn't addressing that notion. You wanted me to address that notion because you think you can somehow argue against that with uhm well we technically spend a couple billion more on oil than on Ukranian aid. Checkmate! when that has been frequently explained by the fact that a) purchases of Russian resources have diminished by sometimes as much as 90% compared to pre-war levels and b) the remaining 10% of purchases are only waht is necessary so Europe has the manufacturing capacity to actually continue supporting Ukraine. The remaining 10% are scheduled to run out in 2027 and the only one who will still keep importing is Hungary cause we know Orban sucks Putin's dick. Literally a ton of the support necessary for your statement to work is that yes two countries in Europe are Putin stooges so we know they do and will continue to buy resources. That doesn't invalidate the 90% drop compared to pre-war levels and the complete phase out. You can complain all you want about Trump (and fuck that guy all the way to the sun) but if Europe had been pulling its weight since the beginning of this and actually showed some real goddamn initiative Trump wouldn't matter. We've been consistently supporting Ukraine more than the fucking US throughout mid-2025 to the tune of 10-20% more and the only reason Americans even go back on this shit is because while they deliver weapons directly and inflate the worth of 20 year old equipment we directly pay premium for these weapons. America has taken a rocket worth a million in 1995 slapped a $1 million price tag on it in 2025 and sent it over to Ukraine at a premium while the MIC re-stocks the American capacities. I know it's something Americans don't like to hear but even fucking Biden slow-trickled the aid deliveries and inflated the numbers to give the MIC more profit. You're a polity of 500M people demanding that a nation of 330M people save you from a nation of 120M people I don't demand shit from you.,metaphor,Rise to the threat is metaphor for respond; Checkmate is chess metaphor; pulling its weight is metaphor for contributing fairly; slow-trickled is metaphor for limited flow; stooges is metaphor for puppets
427,Almost like how in Deuteronomy tells you to stone your very own brother or your son or daughter or the wife you love or your closest friend if they try to tell you to worship other gods. Hmm it's almost as if ancient religious texts are kinda brutal against other religions.,irony,Almost as if is sarcastic framing for obvious observation
428,It's amazing how often ignorant people say that. It's wrong and the barest degree of research would reveal that to you instead with full confidence you repeat this easily countered lie. Who told you this bs and why do you trust them so much that you've repeated it despite the risk you will be viewed as a gullible sheep?,metaphor,Sheep is metaphor for blindly following person
429,I don't know a nation that wouldn't respond to an ISIS-style attack in such a manner if they have the capability. The civilian death numbers are relatively low for a modern war. Look at Syria or Sudan civilian deaths (not the non-equivalent civilian+belligerent numbers Hamas purposely munges). The real tragedy is if Hamas is allowed skim the rebuild again and use those billions to reconstitute and rearm so this happens all over again. ps: I'll note you dodged my simple question and I answered your complex one.,metaphor,Skim is metaphor for steal from; dodged is metaphor for avoided
430,Yes because the age of my newly made Reddit account really takes away from my valid & accurate point. Go be a bot elsewhere the adults are talking.,literal,Direct dismissive response with sarcasm
431,Ukraine does not need help surrenduring. They need help to fight Russia.,literal,Direct statement
432,Russia demands Ukraine to reduce army and give up territory that it hasn't yet succeeded to invade. Sounds like something it can do by itself without any need from USA if it wishes to do so.,irony,Ironic observation about demands
433,we can start from the beginning if you want when hamas did not return all the hostages in the timeframe delineated. (and they still have not). seems like the first violation was Hamas.,literal,Factual argument
434,Their presence in the West Bank is the reason Abbas suspended elections. The PA are afraid that Hamas would win any elections held in the West Bank with surveys aligning with that fear.,literal,Political analysis
435,It's never about peace. It's about pieces and how many can Putin acquire.,metaphor,Wordplay metaphor - peace vs pieces
436,So the plan is for Ukraine to give up some of its land and shrink the army and their ability to fend off another invasion? This is a plan to embolden Russia and to give them an edge when they invade Ukraine the next time.,metaphor,Fend off is metaphor for defend; edge is metaphor for advantage
437,In the bill they have up to 30 days to release once signed into law. You can bet your ass they are going to use up all 30 days before releasing whats likely to be a heavily redacted or possibly even doctored version of the files. Of course there is also the possibility the DOJ just doesn't release them in 30 days since the admin is no stranger to breaking laws.,metaphor,Bet your ass is idiom; doctored is metaphor for altered
438,Well the US/NATO are the ones propping up Ukraine's ability to wage war Oh no they give Ukraine weapons to defend themselves against murderers and rapists. How terrible of them. but they are in the advantageous position unfortunately and likely see no reason to throw away their ill-gotten gains Hence why many democratic nations around the globe are supporting Ukraine so they can sustain the fight and make it so costly for Russia to continue that they give up.,irony,Oh no and How terrible are sarcastic; propping up is metaphor
439,Blow it the fuck up it's the only thing they understand.,literal,Direct aggressive suggestion
440,It would be a shame if a bunch of angry Ukrainians mysteriously appeared and did something to it and then vanished just as quickly as they appeared,irony,Sarcastic suggestion using would be a shame ironically
441,Its no wonder why Arab countries around israel will not take on Palestinian refugees not matter how dire their circumstances,literal,Direct observation about refugee policy
442,instead of being upset at Israel for using the cluster munitions perhaps be upset at Hezbolla for attacking Israel in the first place. While one may believe whatever they want about the legality/morality of Israel's use of these weapons they would not have been used if Lebanon (and the UN) hadn't let Hezbolla setup a mini terrorist state in south Lebanon and use it as a base to attack Israel.,literal,Argumentative statement - direct language
443,I know people say this all the time but this is literally how you start world war 3 by making superpowers believe they can take and keep land by invasion,literal,Direct warning statement
444,No the ceasefire is not absolute. They have operated according to the negotiated conditions.,literal,Direct factual statement
445,Israel's entire justification for massive defense aid hinges on Hamas' existence. If Hamas disappeared tomorrow who would they point to as the existential threat?,literal,Rhetorical question making direct argument
446,Come on guys it's just dress up…the fact that those red hands represented the murder disembowelment and the eating of the organs ripped out is nothing,irony,Sarcastic minimization - just dress up and nothing are ironic
447,Ukraine has never been an ally stop trying to push this. The west is just backing them to get at Russia and nothing else,metaphor,Backing is metaphor for supporting; get at is metaphor for oppose
448,My Dad worked that project and it's predecessor the Airborne Laser Lab at Kirkland AFB.,literal,Personal anecdote - factual
449,why would you even think Russia would consider peace let alone a ceasefire unless you believe the russian propaganda. Yes Ukraine is having a hard fight but they are still here 5 years in alive and kicking. So question is will the russian people keep accepting casualties in the hundred of thousands for very little progress?,metaphor,Alive and kicking is idiom for still active/functioning
450,I'm not going to pretend to know the science for I am dumb. That said does this article mention anything about being able to reliably control the function? If we can reliably control it we can use it to make instant messages truly instant.,literal,Question about scientific application

459,Any details of how they will finance it anywhere and how they will combat UBI inflation? Basically any published analysis of this with details?,literal,Direct question requesting information
460,So they have to give up land and weaken their defenses against being attacked like this again. Yup. Sounds like a Trump deal.,irony,Sarcastic observation about bad deal characteristics
461,As a Brazilian I am glad to be almost anywhere else. Brazil with about 200 million people had about 38 000 homicides EU with more than double of Brazil's population had about 4 000 homicides. I worked a weekend in EU and I made my entire old monthly salary in Brazil. Belem only 20% of the houses are connected to the sewage system. People are so used to listen to politicians lying that when they say some facts people call them idiot.,literal,Personal comparison with statistics - factual
462,Not necessarily always true just starts demanding higher possibly currently unknown forms of EDAC. If they can get reproducibility I'm sure the science will start working on getting that number up and making it easier for EDAC. If anything I'd that's the kind of number of plausibility that will light a fire in those connected areas of science should reproducibility happen.,metaphor,Light a fire is metaphor for motivate or energize
463,Funny the US convinced them to give up nukes and pinky promised they'd have Ukraine's back if russia took advantage. Wonder how that worked out…,irony,Pinky promised used sarcastically; Wonder how that worked out is ironic given obvious failure

467,I doubt if many people in Ukraine expects to get that territory back in the near future. They would accept a ceasefire if the terms recognized the lost ground as still belonging to Ukraine but any proposal that cedes it to Russia is a non-starter. They MIGHT agree to give up claim to the territory if they also were made a NATO member at the same time. But that's not happening.,literal,Political analysis - direct reasoning
468,What a shocking surprise from our former allies in America.,irony,Sarcastic use of shocking surprise

471,Well the US/NATO are the ones propping up Ukraine's ability to wage war and were the ones who told them not to take a peace treaty that was offered very early in the conflict so they're not innocent bystanders in all this.

472,It's not multiple anymore. I've gotten older and I just can't keep up that masterbatory pace like I used to.,irony,Sarcastic self-deprecating joke about aging
473,Yes. The entire foundation of the Pro-Palestinian movement is the violent hatred of Jews. You don't attack Jews Synagogues Holocaust museums etc. in Europe Canada Australia the US etc. if your issue is with the government of Israel and how it's handling a war started by Palestinians. The fact that these people target Jews who have nothing to do with Israel or the war proves it's about hating Jews and anti-Zionism is just the new Antisemitism dog whistle.,metaphor,Foundation is metaphor for basis; dog whistle is metaphor for coded signal

483,Completely understandable and it sucks what the US has done the past 11 or so months to our neighbors to the north. I'd like to add that I've visited Quebec twice in the past couple of months and both were great trips. Everyone I met was incredibly nice and helpful. Like over the top nice compared to what I run into here in the US. So it seems the hatred is directed at the US government and not US citizens visiting Canada which was appreciated.,literal,Personal experience sharing - straightforward
484,Hamas simply has to disarm and follow the agreement that is endorsed by all parties including the UN security council,literal,Direct statement of requirement
485,This kind of declaration is something the US President can unilaterally do and has been able to do since 1996 which is when the concept of an MNNA became a thing. The US Congress gave the US President the power to circumvent the vast majority of materiel sales restrictions by letting them unilaterally declare any country an MNNA.,metaphor,Circumvent is metaphor for bypass or avoid
486,Seems Hamas has killed around 1200 Israelis while Israel has killed almost 70000 people and displaced millions. Is that equivalent in your eyes?,literal,Rhetorical question with statistics

491,I was wondering that the ceasefire has been violated dozens of times. I feel like by definition it hasn't been a ceasefire since the first day.,literal,Direct observation about violations
492,The CSCE Final Act doesn't contain anything more binding. Its an agreement from the 80s that was essentially just a statement by everyone involved that they recognize and will respect each other's borders it was a way to try to tone down some of the rhetoric of the cold war. There's nothing in there about collective action or guaranteeing the borders of all signatories. The inclusion by reference in the Budapest Memorandum looks to be more a statement along the lines of since Ukraine didnt exist as an independent country then we will agree to recognize and respect Ukraine's borders in line with the principles established in this previous agreement. The actual enforcement for violations is still just that they have to be brought to the UNSC. I have no disagreement with anyone who says that the US using economic leverage or trying to get Ukraine to give up territory could be interpreted as the US going against the Budapest Memorandum though personally I think its safe to say it became defunct once the Russian invasion was brought to the UNSC. The only point I'm trying to make is that it's simply incorrect to say that the Budapest Memorandum contained security guarantees.,metaphor,Tone down is metaphor for reduce; defunct is metaphor for no longer effective
493,That doesn't make sense. The West doesn't send conscripted civilians to trenches. The only ones who do that are Russians!,literal,Direct rebuttal statement

497,If everyone stops arming them they will simply have no choice. It's a shitty outcome but that's the reality. Ukraine cannot resist Russia alone.,literal,Direct statement about military reality

499,Israel has breached the cease fire nearly every single day since it has been signed,literal,Direct factual claim
500,Before being elected the first time Trump claimed he could solve terrorism but didn't want to say how without being elected. He finally caved in an interview and his answer was murder the terrorists' families. Terrorist don't care about themselves but they care about their families. When elected he removed restrictions on drone strikes that avoided killing civilians and stopped reporting when they killed them. and then there's the blowing up suspected drug boats thing. Kill everyone despite no imminent danger. It should be illegal if it isn't but it also shows he'll kill people as a preference not a last resort. MAGA is about protecting MAGA. He only refers to his opponents with extreme terminology so that if he has the opportunity he can declare them terrorists so he can go to town.,metaphor,Go to town is idiom for act aggressively
501,This guy is a fucked up vile human being. He's mentally ill and has been for decades. He needs to be placed in a psychiatric ward.,literal,Direct harsh opinion and suggestion

505,In any case no information is traveling faster than the speed of light so why not just use regular light communication for information transfer? I mean this is all very interesting but nothing about it is practical in terms of sending information anywhere. Maybe for special cases like encryption or something?,literal,Scientific reasoning and questions - straightforward

508,I'm seeing Israel accusing Hamas of firing at IDF (without any evidence of such and Hamas denying it) and responding by bombarding Gazan civilians and killing hundreds. Continuing airstrikes something like 30 out of the last 41 days of the 'ceasefire'. Multiple outside observers have documented something like 1000+ violations of the ceasefire by Israel. Idk how any of that is understandable.,literal,Factual claims and argument - direct
509,What is the equivalent ceasefire Israel broke to the one Hamas broke on October 7? Honestly want to understand.,literal,Direct question seeking clarification
510,God hours much I hate this. Our real enemy is bigotry within ourselves and others.,literal,Direct statement about bigotry
511,I think that's up for debate. Again the world is going to eventually tire of giving money/support to Ukraine in a war that doesn't seem to be going anywhere. You might not like it but eventually they will have to choose to accept concessions or go at it alone. At that point they only really have one option.,metaphor,Tire is metaphor for become exhausted; going anywhere is metaphor for making progress; go at it alone is metaphor for act independently
512,This motherfucker just doesn't understand why they won't agree to that. Why does Russia not have to give up any god damn territory in any of these proposals?,literal,Direct angry rhetorical question
513,I mean your analogy is more accurate but did you really expect people to type and explain all that? I like my analogy of two different families of different wealth and number of family members trading with each other. Those families represent countries. Some countries/families will eat more stew. Some will produce more stew. There will always be a trade deficit in some form because not all countries are equal. The grocery store analogy while not accurate is good enough to explain why complaining about a trade deficit is dumb.,literal,Explanation defending analogy use - straightforward
514,This is disgusting and how in the world does anyone thinks this is acceptable and how was this even allowed? Did the British authorities really permit this to happen?,literal,Outraged rhetorical questions
515,You're describing a vast majority of the internet to be honest.,literal,Direct observation
516,Well the US is terrified of Putin so what do you expect? That Anericans are greedy ignorant and untrustworthy should not come as a surprise to anyone.

517,well hamas didn't return the bodies within the timeframe delineated - seems like that was the first violation...,literal,Factual claim about violation
518,The US has literally nothing to lose in supporting Ukraine especially if it can make the Europeans pay for the weapons they're providing. The USSR and China bankrolled the entire North Vietnamese war effort during the Vietnam War providing missiles fighters tanks etc. and there was nothing the US could do against that. Why would it go differently today with the US and Ukraine?,metaphor,Bankrolled is metaphor for financially supported
519,Why do you keep implying it's mine? I'm an Australian you fucking donkey. She's a US citizen she very much is a zealot and frankly the power she weilds and attempts to abuse far beyond the national border is horrific.,metaphor,Weilds is metaphor for exercises
520,No because one man in a trench makes no difference compared to the the entire arms and logistics network of NATO It's a false equivalence because you're comparing a drop of water falling into the ocean vs fucking Chicxulub,metaphor,Drop of water in ocean is metaphor for insignificant contribution; Chicxulub is metaphor for massive impact
521,At what point do Ukraine people should be given the option to choose? Busification and AWOL cases show that A LOT of people don't want to fight. Maybe negotiate a cease fire to allow people to vote?,literal,Direct questions about democratic choice
522,Realistic alternative involves Ukraine making its own decisions not strongarmed from the US with a deal the US chose.,metaphor,Strongarmed is metaphor for coerced or forced

524,Spoons are the the superior utensil to use for eating a salad When using a fork to eat a salad it can be so hard to pick up all the tiny bits and pieces! Shredded carrots and sunflower seeds are impossible to pick up with a fork. Stab a crouton with a fork and it shatters. Most pieces of a salad are scooped onto a fork anyway so why not maximize scoopage with a spoon??,literal,Opinion about utensils - straightforward argument
525,You shouldn't be shamed for not supporting local businesses I'm going to buy things for the cheapest possible price because I don't have much money. I'm not going to feel bad about not buying from the local independently run shop for a higher price. I didn't ask them to start a business and they don't support me in any way so what do I owe them? Being able to buy locally is often a very privileged position. People who say it's only a few bucks more don't realise how significant a few bucks - added on to every purchase - is to a lot of people.,literal,Opinion about shopping choices - direct argument
526,Logos on clothing - expensive and silly I don't know when logos on clothing became a thing but I'm guessing it was during the late '70s when everybody started wearing polo shirts with alligator appliques. Ever since then it seems like every everyone in the world is walking around advertising a clothing company - and paying quite a premium for the privilege of doing so. Let's face it - nobody likes you more because you're wearing a big logo on your sweatshirt. Nobody wants to be your pal because you spent way too much for that garish Disney jacket that you wore twice and hid in the back of your closet...,literal,Opinion about branded clothing - straightforward argument
527,The best Reese's are the minis There. I said it. Not everyone likes peanut butter that much and Reese's actually made me despise peanut butter more. The mini ones are perfect with a balanced ratio of chocolate to peanut butter. That is a candy. If you want peanut butter then just eat peanut butter. I am pretty sure that Reese's sells their peanut butters in jars too.,literal,Candy preference opinion - straightforward
528,Not taking a lunch break isn't a flex it's poor time management. This is specifically directed at people in the office who brag about being soo busy they don't have time to take a lunch break. Bonus points if they're passive aggressive towards you for taking your break. It doesn't make you sound like a hard worker it just sounds like you have poor time management skills.,metaphor,Flex is slang metaphor for showing off; bonus points is idiom for additional criticism
529,Donating money doesn't make you a good person A lot of time I have seen people defending celebs and influencers by saying They do a lot of charity. I don't think charity makes you a good person. Charity is like investment to them. It just to make themselves look good and make money. They don't really give a shit about anyone. Secondly If someone is earning 2-3 million a year then donating like 1% of your income to charity doesn't mean shit.,literal,Opinion about charitable giving - direct argument
530,The Olympics should be abolished The Olympics have caused horrible human rights violations all over the world as well as controversy and abuse of athletes. Mexico city gunned down student protesters who were protesting the Olympics Munich athletes murdered homeless people shuttled out of the host cities so they could keep up appearances misused city funds to build temporary Olympic villages instead of addressing the needs of resident...,metaphor,Shuttled out is metaphor for forcibly removed; keep up appearances is idiom for maintaining image
531,Mens suits should be as varied as women's dresses I don't mind the fact that men wear suits and women wear dresses - I like suits I do. But oh my goodness are most suits so boring. It's just black white with some color im the tie. I have a blue suit a pretty colorful one compared to most other suits and it gives so much more identity than others...,literal,Fashion opinion - straightforward
532,Whispering is more distracting than talking at normal voice volume When people whisper in a quiet setting i.e a library. I tend to know/hear what they're saying than if they talk regularly. Even if i try to channel it out I still hear that push sassy keeeppssspp sound. It's irritating quite frankly.,literal,Opinion about sound - direct
533,The Hobbit Trilogy is perfectly fine No its not the Lotr. If you expected it to be that's your own problem. Going into it thinking you were going to experience watching Lotr for the first time again is what ruined it for many of you...,literal,Movie opinion and defense - straightforward argument
534,Wedding speeches are cringe factories and need to die I was best man last June. The groom's dad went full karaoke into a mic that wasn't even on for five minutes. I still taste the secondhand embarrassment. Then the maid of honor read a poem about the bride's dead cat. People cried for the wrong reasons. I drank my water glass like it could erase sound.

538,Donating money doesn't make you a good person A lot of time I have seen people defending celebs and influencers by saying They do a lot of charity. I don't think charity makes you a good person. Charity is like investment to them. It just to make themselves look good and make money. They don't really give a shit about anyone. Secondly If someone is earning 2-3 million a year then donating like 1% of your income to charity doesn't mean shit. Not everyone is bad tho. There are genuine good celebs out there but protecting them by saying they so charity is stupid and you should be in jail for being stupid.,literal,Direct opinion argument about charitable giving - straightforward despite strong language
539,The best Reese's are the minis There. I said it. Not everyone likes peanut butter that much and Reese's actually made me despise peanut butter more. The mini ones are perfect with a balanced ratio of chocolate to peanut butter. That is a candy. If you want peanut butter then just eat peanut butter. I am pretty sure that Reese's sells their peanut butters in jars too.,literal,Candy preference opinion - straightforward
540,Missing dog reports should be on the news Missing dogs aren't just lost pets they're family members. Local news already shares alerts for missing people and community safety issues so adding quick missing pet reports would take almost no time but could make a huge difference. Not everyone uses social media but almost everyone sees the news. More eyes = more reunions. It's a simple change that could help bring a lot of pets home.,literal,Opinion about news coverage - straightforward
541,Both DD/MM/YYYY and MM/DD/YYYY are equally as bad As a standard both are fine because the local population understand which 2 digits are month and day and it is identical to how the local language orders dates. The argument that DD/MM/YYYY is better because it's from smallest to largest is just wrong. It's actual order is 2nd smallest 1st smallest 4th smallest etc... YYYY/MM/DD is just much better than both.,literal,Technical opinion about date formats - straightforward
542,Kleenex sucks and there is no reason to use them Kleenex is one of the most unnecessary brands out there. Their tissues are thin dissolve immediately are not particularly soft and not exactly cheap. Overall there's so many superior tissue brands that I wonder why Kleenex is even still popular.,literal,Product criticism - direct
543,If it's (food) unhealthy than don't feel guilty about not finishing it. This might be a hard opinion for people that work really hard for their food but in many cases i'd rather not punish myself for accidentally buying something unhealthy by forcing my health to go down hill. It's better to use that extra energy to remember to not make the mistake again rather than to create a challenge for yourself the next day.,literal,Opinion about food waste - straightforward
544,Del deserved to be chewed out by Neil - Planes Trains and Automobiles So it's my yearly rewatch of PT&A and I gotta say I'm not shocked that Neil flipped out at Del...Del is an absolute nightmare and pushed all the right buttons to get the epic tongue lashing from Neil.

Sure but he's been with Del Griffith...and well you saw what he did!,metaphor,Chewed out is idiom for scolded; pushed buttons is metaphor for provoked; tongue lashing is metaphor for verbal criticism
545,Shrek 3 isn't the worst Shrek movie I'm not saying it's the best one but it's far better than most people give it credit for. It felt like a satisfying way to close the Shrek story. Shrek and Fiona settle down to have kids in peace at the swamp Charming dies a satisfying death and Far Far Away has a new young ruler who wants and is capable of the job. Not to mention it's truly hilarious at times Merlin was an awesome new character and a lot of the jokes land well. Shrek 4 is by far the worst one IMO. Felt like a total cash grab and added absolutely nothing to the Shrek story in general. It really just wasn't funny either,metaphor,Cash grab is metaphor for money-motivated project; land well is metaphor for succeed
546,Attack on Titan is an overhyped show/manga! I never got it. The action sequences were nice and it seemed like the story was going somewhere. But then showing the protagonists as the antagonists was just wild. Trying to make the storyline an allegory of the present-day world was just an overused cliche. And to top it all the ending was simply a cop-out!,metaphor,Going somewhere is metaphor for progressing; cop-out is metaphor for easy escape
547,Thanksgiving isn't as prevalent anymore because major companies can't make money off of it and its important that we don't let it happen... companies used to at least acknowledge the time but now since they don't I believe its because they've grown to much onto us and because we are all so dependent on their goods they are starting to overstep because we are allowing them to walk all over our culture as a society...,metaphor,Walk all over is metaphor for dominate; overstep is metaphor for exceed boundaries
548,Slow cooker food is utterly flavorless Anything you throw into a slow cooker will immediately lose any semblance of flavor no matter how much you season it. I do not understand how people can enjoy slow cooker food if they have alternatives...,literal,Strong cooking opinion - direct criticism
549,The Germans specialty in the scientific endeavors was never engineering but chemistry TL;DR - Analyzing German history since around 1870 their advances in Chemistry have always lead or outdid the rest of the world. Engineering reputation is overrated...,literal,Historical analysis - factual argument
550,Fantasy Football leagues should take Thanksgiving off Thanksgiving and Football they are basically one in each other. And that is great getting together with family to watch the three NFL games every Thanksgiving is very much part of the tradition and I very much cherish that experience at my Thanksgiving gatherings. But when it comes to fantasy you have a lot of family members distracted on their phones worried about their bets their standing and all of the heavy attention it requires...,literal,Opinion about holiday traditions - straightforward
551,LeBron doing gambling ads should damage his legacy more than MJ's gambling habit Michael Jordan's gamble habit while maybe a character sleight is a vice restricted to his own personal life. LeBron James doing advertisements for DraftKings is orders of magnitude more harmful to society because it normalizes gambling to all viewers especially young men who view him as some sort of role model.,literal,Comparison argument - direct
552,I'm a people pleaser Is just a less humiliating way of saying I'm spineless Title. Whether it be online posts or IRL self descriptions of behavior its just a way to admit you're a coward without having to use such obviously humiliating language to describe yourself.,metaphor,Spineless is metaphor for lacking courage
553,The Notebook has gotta be one of the WORST romantic movies ever The notebook is for those couples lowkey and by that I mean the couple that are AWFUL together but stay together bc arguing=passion and comfort=boring they also never stop complaining about each other to their friends the movie also sucks bc 1. She CHEATS on her fiancé day TWO 2. Lies about what she's doing 3. The guy sleeps around with a WAR widow and leads her on,literal,Movie criticism - straightforward
554,Carry-Ons Go In The Opposite Side Overhead. Carry-ons should go in the opposite side overhead. Everyone is always standing up doing that rising snake maneuver bug eyed with someone else's bag 6 inches from their face swiveling their had back and forth panicking looking for their bag that's actually 3 rows behind them...,metaphor,Rising snake maneuver is metaphor for awkward movement; bug eyed is metaphor for anxious expression
555,Action movies are way too boring Talking specifically about heavy action movies with hand fighting or car chases like John Wick Mission Impossible or The Fast and the Furious. Most of these movies are WWE for people who don't want to admit they like WWE. The choreography is usually pretty impressive but if you've seen one fake fight you've seen most of them. The movies that use action scenes in place of actual plot or an interesting story just don't appeal to me. Why am I spending 2 hours watching actors fake break windows and fight over guns that always have no ammo?,literal,Movie opinion - direct criticism
556,schools should embrace phones in everyday education not trying to ban it honestly we should encourage more students to use their phones in more creative ways and not trying to take it away from them we should embrace the future of studying for a new era of students.,literal,Education opinion - straightforward
557,Expedition 33 is mediocre and does not deserve all the hype In fact it is so overhyped and all the positive comments are so generic that I would go as far to say that the games creators are using bots to fake the hype... The combat: The game is generic turn-based slop because it removes almost all forms of meaningful strategy... This is BAD DESIGN... The story: is overly dramatic.,metaphor,Slop is metaphor for low-quality content
558,Citizens and neighboring countries were right to be scared and repulsed by Elsa's power in Frozen. Absolute power corrupts absolutely and they'd just be hoping that a random person they haven't seen for years would be benevolent. Nobody should have that much power. if you can end the threat and it is a threat as early as possible that's a best case scenario. otherwise you are gambling with a an unknown entity who has the power to do whatever they want and is already actively putting people's lives at risk.,metaphor,Gambling is metaphor for taking risk
559,Apple pie is only good with whipped cream or a la mode Apple pie and other similar chunked and cooked fruit based deserts have a horrible horrible texture. The texture of cooked fruit is slimey and the fruit is usually inconsistently cooked resulting in an unpredictable mouthfeel. You can't even take a slice normally because the slimey fruit just slips out from between the crust pieces. The only way to combat this is with whipped cream or ice cream whose delectable creaminess help round out the slimey insides of a pie...,metaphor,Combat is metaphor for counteract; round out is metaphor for balance
560,Thanksgiving dinner is massively overhyped... Here's my scorching hot take...Thanksgiving dinner isn't actually good. Turkey mashed potatoes stuffing...they're three of the blandest most flavorless foods imaginable and if they weren't wrapped in decades of cultural hype nobody would ever look forward to this meal...,metaphor,Scorching hot take is metaphor for controversial opinion; wrapped in is metaphor for surrounded by
561,Avatar 2 is a horse girl movie in disguise Most discussions about Avatar 2 was about if it's a good movie or bad about the technical advancements visual effects if it is a cinematic masterpiece or not and other stuff. But my unpopular opinion is that it was a horse girl movie in disguise and apparently no one noticed it just because the gender was switched and the horse was a fancy whale...,metaphor,In disguise is metaphor for hidden as something else
562,Gacha loot boxes card packs roulette mechanics most battle passes etc should be an instant Ao rating...

Publishers squeak around it being gambling using money conversions to in-game currency which you use to gamble...,metaphor,Drain is metaphor for extract; squeak around is metaphor for avoid
563,The watermelon jolly rancher tastes disgusting The watermelon Jolly Rancher tastes downright unpleasant. Instead of the bright refreshing sweetness you'd expect it comes across as overwhelmingly artificial almost like you're tasting a burst of harsh chemical flavoring. Compared to the other Jolly Rancher flavors which tend to be much smoother and more enjoyable the watermelon one really stands out in a bad way.,literal,Candy taste opinion - direct
564,Cold water sucks room temperature water is the best I don't understand people that drink cold water it literally causes the teeth to hurt and you can't gulp it down a lot because it freezes the goddamn neck also it loses it's taste. Room temperature water tastes not better but well it just tastes because it is not covered by being freezing cold also you can drink a lot of it safely to actually satisfy the thirst.,metaphor,Covered by is metaphor for masked or hidden
565,Modern smartphone camera tech fucking sucks. Photography on an iPhone absolutely blows cock why tf are they putting so much engineering into their cameras just to be used casually by people who are complacent/blind to the horrid post processing done to their photos that you cant even escape in RAW mode? I bought an old ass digicam from 2001 with a 6.0 megapixel sensor and the photos are so much sharper and charming than anything iPhone can do.,literal,Technology criticism - direct opinion with crude language
566,720p/1080p still looks good for most games Dont know what all the fuss is about about 4k dosent even look that much different in my opinon sure it looks better but i dont know why i would spend like 300$ for it when 720p/1080p still looks good for most games i would go even as far as saying 480p still looks good but only for some games for games with higher graphics it all gets blurry and besides games arent about the graphics its about the gameplay.,literal,Gaming opinion - straightforward
567,An egg scramble made with omelette ingredients is better than an actual omelette When you make an egg scramble with ingredients of an omelette the filling gets dispersed throughout and the ingredients are evenly distributed throughout the dish during preparation. I also prefer the consistency as opposed to having a bunch of omelette filling in between two layers of egg. Bonus points for cheese lovers in scrambles too because the cheese can melt all throughout the scramble and makes it all that much more delicious.,metaphor,Bonus points is idiom for additional benefit
568,Open Season is genuinely a great movie Say what you want about the sequels but nostalgia aside the first Open Season movie is overhated and it's way better than it gets credit for. It's a simple story with a good message the early 2000's vibe even some emotional moments and beautiful animation for the time. Let's not forget that it's a Sony film first animated one at that and well... Sony doesn't exactly have a good track record they're only sometimes able to make a good film but that was a really good start and a classic childhood film for many people.,literal,Movie opinion - straightforward
569,Prince's songs did not age well and I feel like he isn't as legendary as he is considered I've been listening to tons of music lately all of prolific artists that are considered legends today like MJ The Beatles Marvin Gaye and Prince. I'm a huge fan of all of those artists besides Prince maybe you just had to be there to really understand it. His singing is okay and I know he is a legendary guitarist so wont contest that. Songs like 1999 and when doves cry idk his vocals just take me out of it and just don't sit well...,metaphor,Take me out of it is idiom for disrupting immersion; age well is metaphor for remaining quality over time

572,Overcooked rice is good I don't mean WAYYY over cooked but rice that's slightly mushy and sticks together just a bit too much is the best way to make rice... Now when I make rice for myself I watch it and let it over cook just a little. It's just BETTER I like how easy it is to pick up with a fork I like that the texture isn't as grainy and I feel like the seasonings that I added to the rice while cooking have absorbed more. So yes I think overcooked rice is better.,literal,Food preference opinion - direct
573,School Bus Stop Tickets are more about generating revenue than safety in my county there are school bus stops that are known as ticket generators - using cameras to autoflag drivers. the judges even acknowledge that they get several per week or even day from the same stop if you go to fight it. if there is a bus stop that is generating multiple tickets per day or week (which there are in many locales) at that point it's the county deciding to put kids at risk to generate revenue.,metaphor,Ticket generators is metaphor for money-making locations

575,Water gymnastics is not that beautiful or impressive of a sport I'm not saying I could do any of that because I can't but whenever I see videos of it from the olympics it just looks like curated thrashing in a pool with the occasional flip or whatever. I get that the pools are see-through so you can see everything happening below the water and the body control in such a deep pool is admirable but it doesn't change my mind. It's not an impressive or jaw dropping sport no matter how good a routine or group supposedly is…everyone looks like they're drowning and splashing around in cool swimsuits.,metaphor,Jaw dropping is metaphor for amazing; looks like drowning is comparison metaphor
576,sleep deprivation is a serious problem in our society that is always overlooked with the rise of hustle culture and working longer hours to make ends meet sleep is the first thing to be put on the back burner. people meal plan in order to maintain a healthy diet and go on walks during their lunch breaks to ensure exercise but nobody takes the same care to make sure their sleep schedule is balanced everyone has bags under their eyes is addicted to caffeine and brags about not sleeping enough...,metaphor,Put on the back burner is idiom for deprioritized; rise is metaphor for increase
577,We need to change the term conspiracy theories to conspiracy hoaxes I feel like using the definitions for the words conspiracy and hoax will hopefully back up my argument: A theory is a scientifically acceptable or plausible general principle or body of principles based on facts A hoax is a plan to deceive someone. We should use the term conspiracy hoaxes because half of these are just built to deceive and lie to people about history about politics about literally anything.,literal,Terminology argument with definitions - straightforward

Recaps trigger people's curiosity because most of them arent complete,metaphor,Trigger is metaphor for activate or stimulate

582,People are making way too big of a deal over the iPhone Pocket I keep seeing people online getting angry over Apple selling the iPhone pocket (basically just a sock to carry your iPhone) for $250. The pocket is literally an Issey Miyake and people are outraged at the price for the little thing. I get that it's hella expensive but let's not act like people don't spend thousands of dollars on luxury bags like LV or Gucci...,metaphor,Making a big deal is idiom for overreacting

585,Media literacy isn't dead; it was never alive There's this quite clearly uncritically accepted idea that media literacy is dead because people can't parse the media they watch or listen to or read. But here's the thing: I think in the best days of the past most people couldn't parse the media they watched listened to or read... Media literacy couldn't have died because most people have never had the capacity to be media literate. Conversely today more people than ever have that capacity and simply choose not to be.,metaphor,Dead and alive used as metaphors for existence; parse is metaphor for analyze

589,Space Age Love Song is arguably A Flock Seagulls best song. And not I Ran (So Far Away). A Flock of Seagulls is definitely most known for I Ran and while I absolutely do love the song it's not their best song. Space Age Love Song literally hits all the right chords. Perfect New Wave.,metaphor,Hits all the right chords is music idiom for perfect combination
590,Cruise ships are a terrible. I don't understand why people want to go on cruise ships you end up trapped on a floating hotel with a bunch of strangers and or screaming children and the worst part you can't just leave for a few hours to go sight seeing for a few hours like a normal hotel...

591,Joy Cons should've revolutionized controllers They may have not been perfect with weird flat non ergonomic design cheap plastic feeling and the obvious stick drift but just the option to move my hands freely without holding them tightly and stiff together is a godsend. They make gaming for longer sessions so much more comfortable when I can just relax my arms. Other consoles should've catched on and at least created their own options of this maybe even have driven it further to perfection,metaphor,Godsend is metaphor for blessing; driven it further is metaphor for improved
592,Older sources are more canon not less. And people only think otherwise due to Capitalist brainwashing. No matter how bad media gets we as a society have been trained to believe whatever the newest things are is the best... They've somehow convinced everyone that anything that is brand new is inherently good and valuable for no other reason than being that new...,metaphor,Brainwashing is metaphor for indoctrination; trained is metaphor for conditioned
593,Pokemon games shouldn't have a story Pokemon games should be open world with every gym being equally challangening (which means top level). Maybe the fact that I didn't play the old games as a kid plays a part in this but I really think it's a formula they should let go of. Bonus: Making me have a hm slave is stupid and shouldn't be a thing either.,metaphor,Let go of is metaphor for abandon; slave is metaphor for dedicated pokemon
594,Green bean casserole and sweet potato with marshmallows are gross With Thanksgiving approaching small talk often turns to what people are making or looking forward to having on Thanksgiving. These two dishes seem to come up the most. Green beans are one of my favorite vegetables. Fresh ones from the produce section are the best and frozen are fine but they are one of the worst vegetables to can and most recipes call for canned ones. Then they are covered in some cheesy slop and topped with the crunchy onion things...why are we ruining green beans? Just make a side of fresh ones it's a special meal! Sweet potatoes are already sweet! Adding sugary goo on top is just pointless and buries the taste of the potato. I can only conclude that these recipes were created because people hate vegetables.,metaphor,Slop is metaphor for unappetizing mixture; ruining is metaphor for spoiling; buries is metaphor for hides
595,Stephen Curry has surpassed LeBron James in the GOAT debate Obviously Jordan will always be #1 and Kobe...well because he died his legacy is heightened but Curry is objectively next on the list. Sports fans are always going on about how much tougher sports are today compared to decades ago. Look no further than the Olympics where records are broken every few years. Well by that logic Curry's 4 titles > LeBron's 4 titles.,literal,Sports opinion argument - straightforward
596,Sports gambling isn't that bad and is unfairly vilified. I get it gambling is in general bad the house always wins. Most people will net lose money. The adds are annoying and everywhere... But you'd think Fan Duel personally stole everyones first child... I know more people who've ruined their life on the stock market then on a Sportsbook. But no one wants to abolish brokerages and ban Robin Hood in their state...,irony,Stole first child is ironic exaggeration of people's reactions
597,Gears of War is a terrible video game series Now let me start by saying if you like this series it's perfectly fine with me. But I personally really don't get what's so good about Gears of War. I've played the games before and every time I was bored out of my mind. I thought the story and characters were really dumb and wasn't well written at all...,literal,Video game opinion - direct criticism
598,If you cannot hard reset / format your PC or your phone RIGHT NOW without losing extremely sensitive data you are irresponsible an doing it wrong I format my devices at least a couple times a year for various reasons like trying a new distro. If you simply cannot do that this very moment with your personal or work machines because of photos files games documents etc. you're poorly managing your digital property. Back. That. Up...,literal,Technology management opinion - direct
599,Indie games were never that great the only reason they are being so overhyped is because the industry is so bad that we don't have any option but to cope with these smaller titles Just play old games Indie games were never the standard in the industry we are only talking about them because there is no standard anymore. The dark age has come and so has the copium. Just play older games instead of trying to find some hidden gem nowadays.,metaphor,Dark age is metaphor for bad period; copium is slang metaphor for coping mechanism; hidden gem is metaphor for overlooked quality
600,Porsche is an ugly duck-looking car They have an ugly long duckbill hood. It'd be nice if I could like it and not unwillingly gag in disgust whenever I see one but they're just so damn ugly. Because of their long hood it just looks like an ugly duck.,metaphor,Duck-looking and duckbill are animal comparison metaphors
601,Refried beans is kinda gross actually. Not only does it look unappetizing it's also got a slimy texture. It tastes a bit weird too at best like mashed beans. Do people actually enjoy it or is it just a way to add volume to meals ? Or maybe it is cheap source of protein for those who can't afford to eat meat often.,literal,Food opinion - direct criticism
602,Gate attendants at airports should be more genial and presentable good morning passengers thank you for joining us at frontier Airlines flight #### with nonstop service to (city name). We will begin boarding in approximately 5 minutes... I just think the gate attendants could make an effort to address passengers with a little more geniality... But everyone is always telling that professionalism is important. And while safety is at the forefront I think it's important that airports try going back to creating an experience which makes people less reluctant to fly.,literal,Customer service opinion - straightforward
603,The joker 2 Folie à Deux is a good film thats unfairly judged and criticized Im really stunned because all I heard from people and critics was that this was one of the worst films ever made... This movie was not slop surprisingly like i was led to believe. There was actual effort put into this film... A large portion of the hate I believe comes from the fact that people were expecting another film similar to the first and then people were upset that it was not what they wanted or were expecting from the sequel.,metaphor,Slop is metaphor for low-quality content
604,Altered carbon season 2 was phenomenal but Anthony Mackie ruined it. As the title stated. The story was great the source material was fantastic. But here's the caveat Mackie's range was not fit for the role and because netflix season 2 is all we get. They miss cast and we get screwed.,metaphor,Get screwed is idiom for being negatively affected
605,Lady Tremaine from Cinderella was so dumb We know that after her first husband died her main focus became social climbing and securing profitable marriages for her daughters... the smartest thing she could have done was take advantage of Ella's beauty and grace...,metaphor,Social climbing is metaphor for improving social status; take advantage is metaphor for exploit for benefit
606,Networking events are honestly just exhausting ok so i've been to like 30+ of these things over the past 5 years and i genuinely think they're a waste of time. everyone's like oh you NEED to network but the actual connections i've made? maybe 2 or 3. that's IT. all my real professional relationships came from actually working with people on projects and helping people in online communities...,literal,Professional opinion - direct
607,Ramen noodles should include broth If a customer goes to a restaurant and order a side of ramen noodles they should receive the noodles AND the broth. Not just some dry noodles...,literal,Restaurant expectation opinion - straightforward
608,The godfather part 2 is not as good as the godfather part 1 The main story with Michael is fine (even though I feel like Michael cames out as almost invincible which Vito wasn't in part 1) but all the parts with young Vito in part 2 were genuinely boring and worse of all unnecessary and should have been cut to give more space to the main story. I really don't feel like there was any need to expand on Vito's story and his narrative arch in part 2 wasn't well done,literal,Movie opinion - direct criticism
609,Indeed should only allow jobs to ask for resume cover letter and work related details. They should not allow companies to ask for anything else. I have seen more scams than actual jobs on Indeed. I'm sick of having to hand out my personal information before I know if it's even real. There should be limits on info companies in general can collect before moving further in the interview process...,metaphor,Hand out is metaphor for provide; gotten out of hand is idiom for excessive
610,Washing meat isn't a bad practice. My family is Caribbean and so I was raised washing meat although I am American. I wash meat because it helps clear out the gunk makes it taste better and softens the meat... Washing chicken is frowned upon because of the risk of spreading salmonella. However my family and I never had an issue with this...,literal,Cultural food practice opinion - straightforward
611,Acquiring and driving an old car is better than doing so a new car. I drive a '92 VW Jetta been driving it for the past 5 years. Got it for cheap spare parts are easy to find mechanically easy to fix car is simple has style does what is intended to do: get you from one place to another. People just don't want to deal with others criticising their old raggedy bucket overall worried about what others may think of them. Financial stability >>> keeping up with societal norms,metaphor,Raggedy bucket is metaphor for old car; keeping up is metaphor for matching
612,Put Guillermo del Toro in charge of Dark Universe His version of Frankenstein is the best film version of that story to ever exist... If they were at all smart they'd just give del Toro the reigns say it's all yours make it work and not change anything he does.,metaphor,Give the reigns is metaphor for give control
613,Most TV shows aren't good we just need to see how it ends I started rewatching Stranger Things the other day since the new season is coming out in a few weeks... At the time I thought it was incredibly unique fun scary and incredibly emotional. Really one of the few times a TV show ever actually made me tear up... I think most TV shows are plot forward so they get a tremendous amount of hype surrounding them for a little while but once the show concludes they're pretty quickly forgotten.,literal,TV analysis opinion - straightforward
614,It was easier when we had to dress up for work. So in this new world the old way of looking good for work was simply buying dress clothes. And even cheap dress clothes looked good enough. Casual clothes on the other hand require a lot more effort and understanding of fashion to pull off a polished and professional look. Like I don't have the money to pay a stylist to figure out what hoodie will make me look like you can trust me with your accounts...,metaphor,Pull off is idiom for successfully achieve; polished is metaphor for refined
615,Red onions should be called purple onions We need to find the person who first saw a red onion and said to themselves Hey I'm going to call it a purple onion. I don't understand how that's possible. Maybe they were color blind I don't know but we need to change the name of red onions to purple onions.,literal,Direct opinion about naming - straightforward
616,All commercial food is GMO food If it's farmed it's genetically modified. Unless you're foraging and/or hunting wild then you're eating Genetically Modified Food. Face it people.. since the advent of agriculture we (as a species) have been genetically modifying the stuff we eat. Call it selective or cross breeding if you want. But it's just genetic modification with primitive tools...,literal,Scientific argument - factual reasoning
617,If turkey was so delicious like some people swear by then they'd cook it more than just once or twice per year People swear their turkey is the best and that's all they talk about around this time of year. If it was that good then I don't understand why they only cook it during around this season- even if it's a lot of work. I just don't really get the rave about it.,literal,Food opinion with logical argument
618,Penny Lane is better than Strawberry Fields Forever It seems to have become commonplace that while Penny Lane charted better SFF is the better song. Is it more innovative? Definitely. Does it sound weirder? Absolutely... But Penny Lane is absolute and utter pop music perfection. Not a note is wrong. The lyrics are magical and evocative. I listen to it and enjoy it more than SFF.,literal,Music preference opinion - direct
619,Handmade gifts are not better than bought gifts or no gift at all I'm seeing posts pop up about affording Christmas gifts. People act like a gift is automatically more meaningful just because someone spent hours making it. But the time put in does not magically turn something into a good gift. A simple $10 useful thing usually has more real value than a $10 dessert that is gone the same day or a craft project that ends up collecting dust.,metaphor,Collecting dust is metaphor for unused
620,Arby's used to actually be good. For the longest time ive always seen people diss on Arby's. Arby's used to be one of my favorite fast food places to eat. Nothing hit quite like a half pound beef n cheddar with potato cakes and a Dr.Pepper. The only reason I say used to be good is because the arbys in my area have gone extremely down hill. The quality isn't there like it used to be...,metaphor,Hit is metaphor for satisfied; gone down hill is metaphor for deteriorated
621,Forgiving someone doesn't automatically mean they have to forgive you if the roles were reversed context is people sometimes claim its hypocrisy if a person forgave you for something and you dont forgive them for the same thing. The issue is everyone have different priorities. What you was forgiven for may have not been of value to them as it was if the offensive was committed against you...,literal,Opinion about forgiveness - straightforward
622,The trend of calling everything slop is lazy and stupid. It's like the next evolution in a trend of just bunching everything you don't like into some category defined by a word. First things you didn't like you'd say that's gay then everything you don't like is cringe now everything you don't like is just slop. Is it that hard to just express why you don't like a thing give your perspective and *gasp* listen to people who don't agree?,metaphor,Evolution is metaphor for progression; bunching is metaphor for grouping
623,Pink Floyd is mid Not only are they not one of the best rock bands they are not in the top 5 of british bands. Barely in the top 5 for prog. Drugs. That is what makes this band interesting to people. It seems like everyone who champions them has had their mind altered by taking acid or a copious amount of weed. One shouldn't have to disturb their brain chemistry to get into them...,metaphor,Mind altered is metaphor for changed perception; get into is idiom for appreciate; disturb brain chemistry is metaphor for drug use
624,The Super Bowl should be held in college football stadiums not pro stadiums. In just the last decade we've had 2 Super Bowls held in the home stadium of one of the teams in the game. Those are Super Bowl 55 in Tampa Bay and Super Bowl 56 in LA. In both games the home team won. Holding the Super Bowl in college football stadiums would create a more neutral playing field as well as greater capacity...,metaphor,Playing field is sports metaphor for competitive environment
625,All the special parking spots are stupid I want to start off with saying I'm NOT referring to handicap parking that's the one exception. I'm sick of going to stores and having half the parking lot taken up by online order only families with kids law enforcement only this specific business only. It becomes annoying when I'm constantly not only having to look for a parking spot but look for one that doesn't have some ridiculous requirement.,literal,Parking opinion - direct complaint
626,Canada geese aren't scary and people who make a big fuss about them are crybabies But they poop on my golf course :( IDK DUDE geese love water and are grassland foragers—don't construct the perfect habitat for them and be mad when the homies roll up. But they're bullies when I feed the ducks :( taps sign Don't feed the wildlife bro. Get outta here with your bread—it ain't good for birds anyways?? They're CUTE and CHARMING and their bites DON'T actually hurt at all.,irony,Sarcastic quotations and ironic defense of geese; casual tone mocking complaints
627,The rye chips in Chex mix are the worst part Their texture is too hard and they taste like burnt toast. Idk why people like them and so much so that they actually created an entire new line of just rye chips. Whole bags of rye chips for people to munch on...,literal,Snack preference opinion - direct
628,Today's car prices are outrageous and consumers are single-handedly responsible for it. Car manufacturers have simply adapted optimally to the mass consumer shift from purchasing to leasing or financing a vehicle. Idiotic consumers get fooled by low down payments and monthly payments that automakers stopped producing cheap vehicles and shifted towards more and more expensive cars inflating their prices massively...,metaphor,Fooled is metaphor for deceived; shifted is metaphor for changed; inflating is metaphor for increasing
629,Mouses shouldn't have become a standard peripheral My gripe isn't against mouses specifically but any input method that involves manoeuvring a cursor. What annoys me about it is that it uses real number coordinates to navigate around the screen which requires a certain degree of dexterity to press buttons and navigate UI. A keyboard key in contrast is either pressed or not pressed...,literal,Technology opinion - straightforward argument
630,I dont wanna be that guy but...music in video games breaks my immersion I have been playing Abiotic Factor a game that is much like Half Life/Black Mesa. I never played those games with music. Same with Outlast just no music. I don't get scared or spooked if music is on. Although what i do like to hear is the ambient sounds...the environment...,metaphor,Breaks immersion is metaphor for disrupts experience
631,Overnight oats suck I've tried to like overnight oats. They're relatively cheap easy to make decently nutritious easy to grab on the go. I've tried every combination and every flavor and they all taste horrible. I even like regular oatmeal.,literal,Food opinion - direct
632,Fumbling a ball out of bounds in American football should be a turnover. In other sports like soccer and basketball if a team loses a ball that goes out of bounds the other team receives the ball. In football the team that fumbles receives the ball unless the fumble occurs in the endzone only then it's a turnover. This would make fumbling consistent no matter where it goes out of bounds.,literal,Sports rule opinion - straightforward
633,Traditional theatre is better than musical theatre I get the appeal of musical theatre really I do. However traditional theatre is not only more accessible to actors and performers physically and logistically but designers can get creative with the staging...,literal,Performance art opinion - direct comparison
634,They need to make a new Cash Cab but with Uber/Lift drivers. The amount of drunk people and fun things they could do would be great especially with updated trivia. Plus most cars already have cameras these days so it wouldn't be weird if you didn't want to play.,literal,TV show idea opinion - straightforward
635,The worst part about getting rid of pennies is losing the souvenir coin machines Yeah sure pennies are basically useless. No one actually wants them jingling around in their pockets. But. Those little penny press machines at zoos museums and theme parks? Absolute classics. They cost like 51¢ make that satisfying crank-crank-crank noise and give you a tiny piece of shiny nostalgia to take home. Now with pennies being phased out those machines are basically doomed — and honestly that's the real tragedy here.,metaphor,Doomed is metaphor for destined to fail; tragedy is metaphor for unfortunate loss
636,If you damage another vehicle while driving a company/government vehicle you should lose access to your personal vehicle until the damaged private car is driveable again The consequences of causing a wreck with a company vehicle are far less than when you crash your personal vehicle. If the company vehicle operator is found to be at fault for say distracted driving or dangerous operation that results in the inability of the victims vehicle to be fixed or replaced expeditiously the at fault party should also lose access to their private vehicle until the victim is able to get theirs back.,literal,Policy opinion - straightforward
637,Kid Rock was an original artist and had pretty good music before he became a nutjob His album Devil Without A Cause was the first time I ever heard his music. He combined punk/hip hop/hard rock/country music to create a unique sound He always seemed like a cool guy back in the day. He didn't seem to lean one way or the other. It wasn't until he started with his views that people started hating on his music,metaphor,Nutjob is slang metaphor for crazy person; lean one way or other is metaphor for political position
638,Homelander is NOT a funny character and he has no sense of humor I've heard some people say that they find Homelander from the Prime tv show 'The Boys' funny and they actually laugh at some of his scenes. I don't get it. He's never cracked any actually jokes with a punchline in all the seasons of The Boys so far...,metaphor,Cracked is metaphor for told
639,D&D is horribly boring. Maybe I'm just playing with the wrong groups or hell maybe I'm the problem. But D&D (and TTRPGs in general) are so mind-numbingly boring to me... But the second combat or a dungeon come up it's the most boring slog of all time. Hours upon hours to resolve seconds of combat waiting for people to look up from their phones and figure out what they're going to do...,metaphor,Mind-numbingly is metaphor for extremely; slog is metaphor for tedious effort
640,Cycling is better than walking or running Cycling is way better than walking or running. I don't get why people torture themselves when bikes exist. It's faster more efficient and way easier on your joints. You can cover long distances without feeling completely drained get places quicker and still get a solid workout. Plus its actually fun wind in your face sense of freedom no endless pounding on your knees or feet.,metaphor,Torture is metaphor for subject to difficulty; drained is metaphor for exhausted; pounding is metaphor for impact
641,The Chinese school uniform is the best in the world. The Chinese school uniform is the best because it's just what's basically a track suit. No ties or uncomfortable bits. It's the same for everyone so none of the making girls' uniforms include short skirts. It's simple airy and has room for growing.,literal,Clothing opinion - straightforward
642,Humanities and arts are just as important as science and engineering Humanities effectively teach us to live with each other well and make us more empathetic and understanding of one another. Lots of people view humanities as superfluous because they view books/films/music as entertainment not as enrichment. However when you tell stories from new perspectives and it resonates with people they gain a deeper level of empathy and insight...,literal,Educational philosophy opinion - direct argument
643,Sleeping Dogs is the best GTA game I have consistently come back to this absolute gem since it's release in 2012. Not only is it the best GTA clone ever created I'd argue that it's better than every entry in the GTA franchise. The character development the perks and upgrades available the absolute endless fun of the hand to hand combat the offensive driving... United Front Games truly created a masterpiece.,metaphor,Gem is metaphor for excellent thing; gold standard is metaphor for ideal model
644,The concept of outside clothes and outside germs is germaphobic and mostly useless. Of course if you have a job where you come in contact with bodily fluids disease and grime that's a different story as you would actually be covered in a higher percentage of potentially dangerous germs and bacteria and changing clothes and showering immediately when you get home would be normal. But if you're just going out shopping or making a quick errand I genuinely think there's something wrong in your brain if you're thinking and worrying about germs and poop particles and whatnot that could potentially be on every surface...,literal,Hygiene opinion - direct argument
645,There isn't a single bad Submarine themed film I'm going out there and saying all movies which are submarine themed are incredible! Das boot U571 Red October Crimson tide The enigma Kursk K19 Hostile waters,literal,Movie genre opinion - straightforward
646,TV shows would do better if they were more like the Andy Griffith Show and similar programs Because when I look at TV shows today it's nothing but violence cuss words and the characters being very mean-spirited to each other. When I look at Andy Griffith I see friendliness no cussing good humor good music and the show exists for the sake of entertaining people.,literal,TV programming opinion - direct
647,Buying and selling trending items at a huge markup isn't an AH move I see a lot of posts/comments every time an item goes trending (like Stanley cups popular plush and a certain glass bear) saying that resellers buying a trending item and then marking them up for several times their retail price makes them a bad person. Here's the thing this isn't like price gouging food and water after a hurricane or taking advantage of thrift stores that serve poorer communities...,metaphor,Price gouging is metaphor for excessive pricing; taking advantage is metaphor for exploiting
648,I hate the costumes in Guillermo Del Toro's Frankenstein The movie's set in the mid-19th century and the men are wearing powdered wigs which had gone out of fashion fifty years (at least) before that. It looks like a hodgepodge of every period of European history thrown together in a blender...,metaphor,Thrown together in a blender is metaphor for randomly mixed; hodgepodge is metaphor for messy mixture
649,Modern technology and has destroyed the world. Convenience doesn't equal happiness. I'm aware many people may think I'm stupid for saying this but I believe that modern technology has destroyed our lives. Yes everything is more convenient but at what cost... if we remove any and all obstacles our lives will become empty.,metaphor,Destroyed is metaphor for harmed; empty is metaphor for meaningless; doom scrolling zombies is metaphor for mindless users
650,T'Pau was ahead of its time The 80s and 90s pop band T'Pau was way ahead of its time. Heart and Soul was the precursor to today's rap/pop blends. Even the name T'Pau is not unlike all the T- names of today. Maybe today we would pronounce it Tee Pau.,metaphor,Ahead of its time is metaphor for early innovator; precursor is metaphor for forerunner
651,Comic sans is not that bad Comic sans gets a lot of hate but it's really not as bad as everyone says it is. Like I personally wouldn't actually use it the curvy style isn't my thing but I don't hate it. What does everyone else think?,literal,Font opinion - direct
652,Aside from the Romeo and Juliet scene Age of Extinction is one of the best Transformers movies. In my rankings it's 2nd just behind DOTM. Cade was a good main character (arguably better than Sam) the designs are the best out of any Transformers film and I found the story enjoyable. I never understood the hate for it,literal,Movie opinion - straightforward
653,colorless gemstones are the jewelry equivalent of beige walls White sapphire diamond quartz etc. Sure they sparkle but they're boring. Emeralds pink sapphires chocolate diamonds etc. are all more visually exciting than a simple clear flawless diamond or other similar looking stone.,metaphor,Equivalent is comparison; boring vs exciting are evaluative metaphors
654,Most Popular Horror Movie Villains Are Not Scary IMO unstoppable entities that just keep coming back through movie tropes are not scary in the slightest. Freddy Jason Michael Myers etc lose their scare factor when in every movie no matter what the protagonist does they come back. It erases the stakes tension buildup and grip of the plot. Why the hell would I be invested in a group of people and their grueling fight against a demonic entity when after hours of intense running and fighting it just pops up on screen again and/or murders them right before the credits...,metaphor,Lose scare factor is metaphor for become less frightening; erases is metaphor for eliminates; grip is metaphor for hold on attention
655,Dubstep was and still is good music A good bass line and drop gave me frisson back in the early 2000s and still does the same now better than most other genres of music. I know it's a disliked and memed on genre even at the height of its popularity but I love it.,metaphor,Height is metaphor for peak
656,A lot of modern anime feels like a social skills guide disguised as a story. So I used to watch a fair share of anime when I was younger but I've fallen off in recent years. A big reason is that so many shows are set in highschool and that just gets boring after a while... I couldn't help but notice that a lot of the anime I checked out seem specifically directed at people who have a genuinely hard time integrating into society... But these shows take it to such an extreme that even a simple dialogue in a supermarket feels like a Dark Souls boss battle for them.,metaphor,Fallen off is metaphor for stopped; disguised as is metaphor for presented as; boss battle is gaming metaphor for difficult challenge
657,Cinematic trailers are better than gameplay trailers. They're just better. Now at least. Gameplay trailers are only useful if you intend to pre-order a game now... Reviews and raw gameplay footage that is not curated by the developer are a more reliable metric of quality. Gameplay trailers definitely USED to be more helpful but now are kinda just worse excitement generators than a good cinematic trailer.,metaphor,Excitement generators is metaphor for things that create excitement
658,Saying you're bad at math is like saying you're bad at thinking From inicial school math to abstract mathematics courses it's essentially pure reasoning; all properties and theorems have proofs and a logical explanation. That said many people struggle not because they genuinely lack the ability to learn but because they never bothered to learn the fundamentals. And math is cumulative; if you don't know one topic it's difficult to move on to the next.,literal,Educational opinion - straightforward argument
659,People need to step to the right when on elevators or moving sidewalks It is the considerate thing to do. Unless you absolutely have all the luggage that you cant stage it on the side with you there is no reason why you can't stand to the side with your stuff and let others walk past you.,literal,Etiquette opinion - direct
660,Olympic sports where judges determine the outcome should not be a included at the olympics. Sports like gymnastics figure skating diving synchronized swimming halfpipe break dancing etc. as entertaining as they are should not be part of the olympics. It's not a competitive sport it's comparative performance that requires a third party of experts to determine a winner of the performance.,literal,Sports policy opinion - straightforward
661,Mario has been overused by Nintendo I dno I'm just getting sick of seeing Mario this and Mario that. Guess what they're releasing Mario Kart 637... and yes of course Rainbow Road is on there. They clearly realised that Mario Kart was drying up by changing it up to allow free-roaming to make it more appealing. Seems like they're bleeding this game series and characters dry and they really seem to clinge onto Mario games.,metaphor,Drying up is metaphor for losing appeal; bleeding dry is metaphor for overexploiting; clinge onto is metaphor for desperately hold
662,Churu cat snacks are wasteful They're going to be the K cups of our time. Using a little bit of waste every time you want to give your cat a treat is a lot of unnecessary waste that is clogging up our already overburdened waste system...,metaphor,K cups of our time is comparison metaphor; clogging up is metaphor for filling; overburdened is metaphor for overloaded
663,Side punchout cameras are better than middle punchout cameras on phone screens... The middle punchout forces everything downwards while the side punchout allows for notifications and those icon things to be displayed at the top of the screen. No TV show or YT video has important stuff at the top right and left corners. The punchouts block everything and ruin the experience of a phone so much for such a tiny thing. Your screen real estate is effectively lessened.,metaphor,Forces is metaphor for pushes; block is metaphor for obstruct; real estate is metaphor for available space
664,Fantastic beasts 1-3 are better then the original HP series! I just find the original series not that good to begin with they are good books but I just prefer the fantastic beasts world character and story. and the actor change for Grindelwald was the best thing that could have happened Johnny showed us the Grindelwald that could take over the word Mads gave us the grindelwald that could rule the world and make Dumbledore fall in love with him.,metaphor,Take over the world is metaphor for dominate; rule is metaphor for control
665,ODB is the greatest loss for modern music ODB had a lot of problems but ODB was also uniquely talented. Dude had bars and dude had a beautiful one of a kind approach to melody. Hip Hop is a far more relevant genre than rock and although 2 Pac and others may have had a bigger impact they are also more easily copied. ODB was unique therefore he was the greatest loss for modern music.,metaphor,Loss is metaphor for unfortunate death; had bars is slang metaphor for had good lyrics
666,Imagine Dragons hate is becoming very unreasonable they're not the worst band on the planet ya'll. As the title suggests I personally don't think Imagine Dragons is that bad. Sure they've had massive commercial success and some of their songs might not be everyone's cup of tea but they're basically becoming the Nickelback of the 2010s and 2020s.,metaphor,Cup of tea is idiom for preference; becoming the Nickelback is comparison metaphor for being unfairly hated

669,I prefer to wear a lot of solid colors these days but I wore some shirts with big logos on them as a teenager and in my 20s. I never wore them to impress I just thought they looked cool I wore them for myself. I worked at a place where I got a discount on clothing so it's not like I was spending all of my money on clothes with logos on them.,literal,Personal experience comment - straightforward
670,I agree. They range in the 7-8 out of 10 range but get compared to perfect 10s so they look worse by comparison.,literal,Direct opinion about ratings

672,I like it you can have your opinion on it but mine won't change.,literal,Direct statement about opinion
673,They exist most people just think they look hideous.,literal,Direct factual statement
674,Not really the point. Labor is often 70% of the cost and cheapest vendor often leaves a crew idle and you can't find a similar part that will work. The emergency is the need to stay on schedule or get fired from the current job or miss the next one. Had a crew last year lose a job because they didn't have a part which cost 3 days but that made the us miss the rough inspections which meant the drywall guys went elsewhere and the whole project backed up 3 weeks...,metaphor,Backed up is metaphor for delayed
675,Would kill for a limited series or movie just about the Witch King,metaphor,Would kill for is hyperbolic idiom for strongly desire
676,The walmarts usually close down after a few years anyway leaving the area pretty much fucked,literal,Direct statement with crude language
677,I've seen more poor people trying to look wealthy by wearing designer or expensive brands with big logos than I've seen anyone with money wearing them. At this point big designer logo stuff just registers in my brain as trashy or ghetto. Big logos for things people like like a show or a something similiar I see as neat. Its not trying to be fancy and makes me wanna go up and ask what they like about whatever the logo is from.,metaphor,Registers in brain is metaphor for perceived as
678,I've never been farted directly on by a stranger at a Target. Walmart does not meet that standard.,irony,Ironic comparison where being farted on becomes a standard
679,You haven't changed my mind but I'm going to try it.,literal,Direct statement about trying suggestion
680,I just don't understand how we can spend so much money and effort on playing schoolyard games while there are famine and energy crises to deal with. Once those are solved hold a new set of games every day for all I care just fuckin prioritize.,literal,Direct critical opinion about priorities
681,Nice try Mr. of Angmar. You're just trying to get your own show,irony,Sarcastic accusation pretending commenter is the Witch King character
682,Nah man you're right. The crunchiest and veggies often end up at the bottom of the bowl eaten separate from the lettuce. This happens when there is too much dressing or light dressing.,literal,Agreement with observation - straightforward
683,Everyone has different standards in what is flat-out bad. I've only watched the Hobbit trilogy twice in the theater and once at home whereas I've watched the LOTR trilogy countless times. So in terms of a quality and watchability gulf we're on the same page. Diet Wormtongue as I call him whoever the fuck that character was haunts my dreams… EDIT: Alfrid. An on-screen abomination,metaphor,Gulf is metaphor for large difference; Diet Wormtongue is comparison metaphor; haunts is metaphor for bothers
684,Well yeah? That's what my initial comment said almost word for word? That gendered difference is 100% what it is because men look different than women. Women's styles are also normally different than mens. It is what it is if you want to call that propaganda then sure. But when it comes to suits (that's what this is about) I stand by my comment. Not everything has a deeper meaning or source. This is the kind of bs arguments that make conservatives look at us like nutjobs.,metaphor,Stand by is metaphor for maintain; look at us like is metaphor for perceive as
685,Lots of little toppings fall off and are scooped up at the end. Especially if you don't go heavy on the dressing,literal,Direct observation about eating

689,This is my complaint about any episodic streaming show on hulu/netflix or whatever. There's enough there that it would be good if it was like one... maybe two movies instead of a bunch of meaningless fluff in between. Movies can be great precisely because you cut stuff down.,metaphor,Fluff is metaphor for filler content; cut down is metaphor for reduce
690,They ARE bad movies tho. So very very bad. Much less than the sum of the parts. LOTR was good. It didn't insert a bunch of unnecessary shit. It actually edited reductively.,literal,Direct critical opinion
691,Love the universe love the LOTR books and movies read the Hobbit a thousand times as a kid...the Hobbit movie trilogy is boring it makes me feel disconnected...it's just not good. That's not a comparison to LOTR. It's an opinion based on movies in general. Excellent for putting me to sleep when I'm restless though.,literal,Direct opinion with personal experience
692,Cans of soda for $2.5 at a restaurant? That is a steal! Im used to having to fork out $4-8 with no free refills! (Not USA).,metaphor,Steal is slang metaphor for good deal; fork out is idiom for pay

694,They put ads in my $139 prime membership to help fund those budgets… arguably they are spending my money/time depending on whether I pay $36 a year more for no ads or spend my time watching the ads.,literal,Direct complaint about subscription service
695,It is not well made at all. The story is all over the place. The world feels small. The characters are inconsistent and so remote from the lore that they're unrecognizable from their LOTR equivalent. The whole time I was watching it I was wondering what the hell was going on… The story is bad and cringe and the show is so so bad that I can't actually believe someone liked it let alone liked it more than The Hobbit. Like you have to be a troll. Please tell me no one actually has your opinion. Please don't make this world even more disappointing than it already is.,literal,Strong negative opinion - direct criticism

698,Honestly I quit watching when the sexy dwarf showed up. It was obviously going to be trash. Murder by focus group.,metaphor,Trash is metaphor for bad quality; murder by focus group is metaphor for ruined by committee decisions

700,Using the fork without a jabbing motion. Not that hard to understand guys scooping with a fork,literal,Direct explanation of technique
701,The writing is of the same quality as Lotr. And the same adaptation methods. The script pacing themes and adaptation are not developed to nearly the caliber of the Lotr movies. Tauriel oh boy god forbid they want a female presence. JFC dude this is a terrible straw man and you know it. She exists solely to facilitate an unnecessary and poorly developed love triangle. Look man they're not bad movies and the internet can as a rule always benefit from a few deep breaths but most people would agree that there's a clear difference in quality between these two trilogies...,metaphor,Straw man is argument metaphor; benefit from deep breaths is metaphor for calm down
702,People bitch and moan and moan and bitch that movies based on books don't tell the full story. Then you give them THREE movies based on ONE book and they bitch and moan and moan and bitch that it's 3 movies. Do you people want every last detail of the book in the movie or not?,literal,Direct frustrated argument with repetition for emphasis
703,This is a nice poem. :) Hopefully the different way of communication will have a greater impact than what the rest of us managed.,literal,Supportive comment - straightforward
704,In my opinion Legolas is the worst part of the Hobbit trilogy. He feels shoehorned in and the editing done to de-age Orlando Bloom is bad at best. Adding him was entirely unnecessary and only took away from the story and added totally unnecessary parts. As others noted they really just added a bunch of stuff so they could make extra movies. All this did was cheapen the story make things more confusing and slow the plot down to a grueling pace,metaphor,Shoehorned is metaphor for forced in; took away is metaphor for detracted; cheapen is metaphor for reduce quality; grueling is metaphor for tediously slow

708,You are completely right it is fine but that's the problem. Being just ok a lot of times is worse than even being bad. I would rather watch 3 movies that do something interesting (good or bad) than watch 3 bland movies that I forget the week after. The reason they are looked at as bad is they wasted 8-9 hours of your life for just ok. If it takes you 3 movies to tell one story just make it into a TV show.,literal,Critical opinion argument - straightforward
709,No he's saying it should be 91/11/5202. The 9 being the smallest unit (days) the first 1 being the next smallest (10's of days) then months then ten's of months etc. still stupid though because that's not how we right numbers,literal,Explanation of argument - direct

713,This is one of those popular unpopular opinions. Most people don't really care one way or another. If their clothes have brands/logos on them. It's incidental mostly. Then there's the folks that DO care about logos and brands which is who you're talking about. They're not really a majority they just happen to be noticeable. Then there's the folks that are the opposite and refuse to buy something with any branding on it....even if it's an otherwise quality product at an otherwise reasonable price. So I don't really think it's unpopular or popular...it's just most people don't really even have much opinion beyond being aware of it.,literal,Meta-analysis of the opinion - straightforward
714,Yes but people expect better than fine as they should when it comes to Tolkien Peter Jackson and his adaptations. They don't expect 74 marvel sequels,literal,Direct statement about expectations
715,Totally agree and well put! Its a shame people have downvoted you into the negatives!!,literal,Supportive comment - straightforward
716,Fuck no lol it's not remotely good. Tolkien rolled in his grave when Hollywood shit that thing out You can like it. That's fine. But as a piece of the LOTR universe it breaks so fucking much of the lore it objectively is not good LOTR content.,metaphor,Rolled in his grave is idiom for would disapprove; shit out is crude metaphor for produced poorly
717,It isn't it the classic uniformed Reddit blanked statement just like modern art is money laundering,literal,Direct criticism of common reddit statement
718,Chopsticks are generally superior and definitely best for salads.,literal,Direct opinion about utensils
719,that's okay. Because no matter what at the end of the day at least one person is receiving love from these kind gestures. This is so obvious and yet so many people miss this thank you.,metaphor,At the end of the day is idiom for ultimately
720,Yes. It's so disappointing watching great companies like VW and GM sell out to shareholders. They are truly parasites and I'm not a lefty either hope I don't get banned. It's all the same in the US. Boeing HP Dell. Firestone and GE at least once per decade always sacrifice their customers for wall street gains. But that's where our retirement is stored so line must go up.,metaphor,Sell out is metaphor for betray principles; parasites is metaphor for harmful entities; sacrifice is metaphor for prioritize against; line must go up is idiom for stock price increase
721,Do people think Smaug was the example of too much CGI in the Hobbit? That's not my impression. I thought he was seen as one of the best things about it. At least at first before the golden statue stuff. It's characters like Azog as compared to someone like Lurtz where the difference is noticeable in a bad way. Or the goblins vs the Moria orcs. They just look much more fake and the whole direction of the scenes more video gamey with little feeling of danger or tension despite the constant action...,metaphor,Video gamey is comparison metaphor for unrealistic game-like quality
722,Because here mods shut down literally everything leading to the same stuff being posted over and over and stagnating on the front page. Then we have the evil twin brother r\trueunpopularopinion which is so unmoderated it has turned into a right wing echo chamber I just want someone looking in the middle of these two extremes.,metaphor,Shut down is metaphor for remove; stagnating is metaphor for becoming stale; evil twin brother is metaphor for problematic counterpart; echo chamber is metaphor for reinforcing environment
723,This just reads like enjoy your slop. Fine fine is what you think is what creators should be aiming for? Not beautiful or engaging thought provoking stimulating or challenging. No FINE. Lowest denominator thinking like this is why we live in the age of infinite reboots and sequels.,metaphor,Slop is metaphor for low quality; lowest denominator is metaphor for minimum quality; age of is metaphor for era characterized by
724,It's not terrible but not great and nowhere close to as memorable/iconic as LOTR. The first movie I thoroughly enjoyed. The second had a strong start but fell kind of flat for me. Three felt like an episode of WWE to me with each army showing up to lay claim to the gold and then a rumble ensues. I think The Hobbit would have 100% worked better as a two-part series with each part being around 3 hours.,metaphor,Fell flat is idiom for failed to maintain quality; felt like WWE is comparison metaphor for excessive fighting spectacle
725,Edit to add more information on what I mean by significant digit: The more change you get when you modify a digit the greater it's significance. The 1st digit of YYYY is most significant because a change in that is +/- 1000 years (e.g. 2025 > 3025) where as the 2nd digit of DD is the least significant. I guess my unpopular opinion is that digits should be taken into account for a format and neither DD/MM/YYYY and MM/DD/YYYY properly sorts by digits. Typo: meant to say the argument that DD/MM/YYY... So... YDMMYYYD? So today date 19/11/2025 would be 21110259 Or are you really badly arguing for YYYY/MM/DD,literal,Technical explanation and question - straightforward
726,That is a truly unpopular opinion. The problem with the trilogy is that they added stuff that wasn't in Tolkien. It should have been two movies. One through Beorn the other from Beorn to the conclusion. We didn't need the elves turned into good guys nor the elf/hobbit infatuation.,literal,Direct criticism with alternative suggestion
727,Completely agree I don't care what anyone says I like that there is more LoTR media and ok the story isn't the best sometimes but it's well-made and visually amazing. Plus anything that has more Galadriel will never get complaints from me.,literal,Supportive opinion - straightforward
728,Oof. I hate them so much. An absolute blaspheme against a great story. Have an updoot.,metaphor,Blaspheme is metaphor for offense against; updoot is internet slang for upvote

731,SO agreed. I'm a drag king and coming up with costumes that fit the idea of 'masculine' without being the same boring cuts can be a real challenge.,literal,Personal experience agreement - straightforward
732,I hate the buy local argument. Who am I supposed to buy from locally? There's Walmart or target! It's all chains here. I guess I could drive farther to find some local-ish stores but even those places aren't going to carry the majority of the items I need. There's localish coffee and bakeries. That's pretty much it! No one locally is selling dry shampoo or sneakers (the two things I wanted to buy this week),literal,Direct argument about local shopping limitations

739,NTA and you are right you need to nip this in the bud and enforce that boundary or they will keep pushing and pushing. And then she'll be the first one to complain or try to sue you if something happens to one of the kids...,metaphor,Nip in the bud is idiom for stop early; pushing is metaphor for testing boundaries

742,NTA No matter how many tasks you asked him to do that would still be paid labor - he would charge the entire time he was on the clock. Unless he clocked off before opening it for you and then clocked back in it was still paid labor.,metaphor,On the clock is idiom for being paid for time
743,Is your mom getting pushback from people maybe even her ex-husband? Because it sounds as if she was into it. NTA. Tell them that it's YOUR wedding and they're not the gatekeepers of tradition. If they don't want to do it the way you want then you will walk yourself down the aisle alone like in the Crazy Rich Asians movie.,metaphor,Getting pushback is metaphor for receiving resistance; gatekeepers is metaphor for controllers or arbiters
744,Ok yeah but look at it this way. If someone tells you This cake isn't good for you and then they procede and eat it in front of you how are you going to feel? That's basically what he did to his wife.,literal,Analogy explanation - straightforward comparison
745,NTA but I'm not sure why you just didn't say you were drinking in the first place. That would have (hopefully) settled it right there. It was a little bit out of line for your mom to demand you pick her up like that but you don't help your case by not just shutting her right down by saying you were drinking,metaphor,Out of line is idiom for inappropriate; shutting down is metaphor for stopping firmly; help your case is legal metaphor for supporting your position
746,NTA. Sounds like Mom doesn't want to do it Dad and fiancé want the traditional walk and you want something different. It is great to honor both parents to but you need to find a way that makes you Mom comfortable. And if you don't want just your Dad then walk by yourself. That is also an option. And while weddings are something you and your fiancé should plan together I don't think he needs to dictate who walks you down the aisle. That is a special moment for YOU with the person or people of your choosing. It doesn't have anything to do with him.,literal,Direct advice - straightforward
