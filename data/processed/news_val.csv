"Padma Lakshmi says she wouldn’t go back to her 20s

A note from Wild Card host Rachel Martin: I loved watching Padma Lakshmi as a judge on Top Chef for so many years because she was so enthusiastic about eating new things. There's an inherent curiosity about Padma. She wants to know all the secrets to a stellar dish, but she also wants to know the story behind the person who made it.

For her, food is how we connect. And how we celebrate the cultural diversity that is America. She's published a new cookbook called ""Padma's All American – Tales, Travels and Recipes from Taste the Nation and Beyond.""",literal
"The New York Mets claimed they wanted to improve their team defense this offseason, and they took a big step towards doing that on Sunday, acquiring 2025 Gold Gove second baseman Marcus Semien from the Rangers for outfielder Brandon Nimmo.

BREAKING: The New York Mets and Texas Rangers are finalizing a trade that would send second baseman Marcus Semien to the Mets and outfielder Brandon Nimmo to the Rangers, sources tell ESPN — Jeff Passan (@JeffPassan) November 23, 2025

The trade still needs to be approved by Major League Baseball, but it appears to be a one-for-one trade for now. The deal was also contingent on Nimmo waiving his no-trade clause, but it’s been reported that Nimmo did do that to facilitate the trade.

Nimmo, who had a full no-trade clause, has approved the deal, league sources said. https://t.co/7nHKBvePw0 — Will Sammon (@WillSammon) November 23, 2025

Why would the Mets make this trade?

Semien, 35, is coming off one of the worst offensive seasons of his career and is due $72 million over the next three years. In that sense, you can see why the Rangers wanted to move on from Semien, but perhaps not why the Mets wanted to acquire him.

Semien has now seen his offensive production decline in each of the last two seasons in terms of power production, contact rate, and swinging strike rate. Over the last two seasons, he’s been challenged with far more sinkers and cutters, and pitchers appear to be effectively getting in on his hands. His infield fly ball rate, which was 7.6% in 2023 and 8.5% in 2022, skyrocketed to 13.8% in 2024 and 13.1% in 2025.

Semien is still making above-average contact overall and has remained consistent with a barrel rate around 6.6%, so there is an argument that he could be closer to a .250 hitter with 15+ home runs and 10+ steals. While that is not exciting on the surface, it’s better than what he produced last year.

However, the reason the Mets wanted to make this deal is for defensive purposes. Semien still produced an Outs Above Average of 7 last season and remains a solid defender at second base. Semien would be a significant improvement there on players like Jeff McNeil or Brett Baty and would create a strong double play combo up the middle with shortstop Francisco Lindor. The deal also removes Nimmo from the outfield, where he posted a -1 Outs Above Average on the season, and allows the Mets to improve their outfield defense as well.

It seems that the Mets were happy to take an offensive hit for the potential defensive gain. The club also has more flexibility for their offseason plans for the outfield, which again, could be an upgrade to Nimmo defensively.

Why would the Rangers make this trade?

Offensively speaking, Nimmo was clearly superior to Semien last year. He hit .262/.324/.436 with 25 home runs and 13 steals. It seems likely that the Rangers would use Nimmo as their primary left fielder, which means he’d be replacing the non-tendered Adolis Garcia, who posted a .227/.271/.394 line last year with 19 home runs and a 24.7% strikeout rate. That’s an improvement in almost all facets.

The Rangers could also choose to use Nimmo at designated hitter and play Alejandro Osuna in the outfield with Wyatt Langford and Evan Carter.

Nimmo is due $102.5 million over the next five seasons, which is a significant contract for the Rangers to take on, but they clearly believe Nimmo is a better fit at the top of their lineup than Semien.

What’s the fantasy baseball impact?

It’s hard to see much of a change for Semien. He goes from hitting at the top of a good lineup in a pitcher’s park to hitting atop a good lineup in a modest pitcher’s park. Yes, in some respects, Citi Field is better for right-handed hitters, but in terms of just hits for right-handed hitters, Globe Life Field ranked 23rd and Citi Field ranked 26th, according to Statcast Park Factors. Citi Field does rank 7th for right-handed pull power, but Globe Life was 10th, so, again, it’s just a modest upgrade. If anything, you’d wonder if the fresh start gives him a mild boost.

Same goes for Nimmo. Citi Field and Globe Life are nearly identical in park factors for left-handed hitters. Globe Life does rank 12th for left-handed pull power while Citi Field ranks 16th, so it’s a mild improvement. However, you could make the argument that the Rangers’ lineup is slightly worse than the Mets.

At the end of the day, I wouldn’t approach either one of these players much differently in fantasy than you were planning to two days ago.",figurative
"WATCH: A video provided by a former military guard shows soldiers torturing two detainees at an infantry base in Mandalay region in October 2021.

Al Jazeera has also gathered testimonies from several military defectors who confirm that deaths in custody are common.

A senior officer, “AK”, who asked for a pseudonym to protect his identity, defected from the military after being forced to take part in an extrajudicial killing operation. He alleges that the murder of captured urban fighters is sanctioned at the highest level.

AK described a night in early 2024 when four suspected urban fighters were bound, blindfolded and taken away from one of the military’s deadliest interrogation facilities.

The four prisoners, suspected assassins, were tortured so badly that they had to be propped up by soldiers as they were taken to a waiting pickup truck. Surrounded by armed guards, the four were then transported to a quiet road away from the city and forced to kneel beside a ditch.

AK said a senior officer ordered the soldiers to shoot the men with pistols to avoid unnecessary noise.

The suspects were shot from behind, AK said, but they did not die immediately. As the rebels bled on the ground, the soldiers grew restless waiting for them to die, so they shot them again, then again.

“I don’t think they knew that was the moment they would die, until they heard bullets … their deaths were so brutal I couldn’t sleep for a week,” AK told Al Jazeera.

The men’s bodies were then transferred to a military hospital, where AK says doctors signed certificates that obscured their cause of death. Medical staff employed by the military are often pressured to cover up such murders, he says.

Al Jazeera has seen photos of three of the men’s bodies, along with leaked copies of the official death report, which says they were killed while trying to escape. The injuries visible in the photos do not match that claim. One photo, AK pointed out, shows one of the men with his eyes covered and his hands tied, challenging the account that he had been trying to get away.

Claiming that prisoners were killed while trying to flee is a common narrative used by the military to cover up extrajudicial killings, the former senior officer said.

Some of the details about the executions that AK shared have been omitted here due to concern about reprisals. But to verify this incident, Al Jazeera triangulated testimonies and leaked documents with local media reports and interviews with former military and civil society organisation sources.

Critically, AK explained such murders could not take place without the approval of senior military officials.

“No one could leave that detention centre without approval from the top,” he said.

Al Jazeera also spoke with two former army doctors who served on different bases after the coup. Both said they were prevented from providing medical attention to civilians aligned with the resistance who had serious injuries. After the coup, they said, it became common practice for senior military doctors to fake the causes of death of detainees who had been killed or left to die in custody.

The doctors, who requested anonymity, confirmed that such cover-ups by military leaders are both organised and strategic, allowing detainees to be murdered or left to die while the regime avoids accountability.

"Israel’s bombing of Gaza is not a ‘violation of the ceasefire’. It is a continuing genocide under diplomatic cover.

When on October 10, a “ceasefire” was declared in Gaza, many Palestinians breathed a sigh of relief. They had just endured two years of constant bombardment estimated to equal roughly six times the explosive force of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945, concentrated on an area less than half the size of the Japanese city..

The devastation was all encompassing. All hospitals and universities had been bombed, most homes and schools destroyed and vital infrastructure, such as the sewage system and electricity lines, had been damaged beyond repair. An estimated 50 million tonnes of rubble was strewn across the strip and under it lay at least 10,000 bodies of Palestinians killed in bombardments who were yet to be recovered.

And yet, the respite the people of Gaza expected to finally come never materialised. Almost immediately after the “ceasefire” announcement, the Israeli regime started bombing the strip again. It hasn’t stopped since then.

According to Gaza’s Government Media Office, Israel has violated the “ceasefire” nearly 500 times in 44 days, killing 342 civilians. The deadliest day was on October 29 when the Israeli Occupation Forces (IOF) killed 109 Palestinians, including 52 children. More recently, on Thursday, 32 Palestinians were killed, including an entire family in the Zeitoun neighbourhood of Gaza City when a bomb was dropped on a building they were sheltering in.

But it is not just the bombardment that hasn’t stopped. The starvation hasn’t either.

As per the “ceasefire” agreement, 600 trucks of aid were supposed to be allowed in every day, which Israel has not fulfilled. As Al Jazeera’s correspondent Hind al-Khoudary has reported from Gaza, the IOF is permitting only 150 trucks a day to cross into the strip. They are also preventing the entry of nutritious foods, including meat, dairy and vegetables, as well as much-needed medicine, tents and other materials for shelter.

A coalition of Palestinian relief agencies estimated that the aid that enters now doesn’t even cover a quarter of the basic needs of the population.

The United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), which says it has enough food in its warehouses to feed everyone in Gaza for months, is still not allowed to bring in any of it. This is in direct contravention of an October advisory opinion by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) that the Israeli regime has a duty to not impede the supply of aid by UN agencies, including UNRWA.

The court also rejected Israeli accusations that the agency lacks neutrality and asserted that it is an indispensable actor in the humanitarian landscape. Nonetheless, the Israeli regime has rejected the advisory opinion and continues to limit UNRWA activities by preventing aid distribution and denying visas to its international staff.

The Israeli regime is also not abiding by the provisional measures that were laid out in an ICJ ruling in January 2024 that found that plausible acts of genocide were being committed in Gaza. These measures included preventing acts of genocide, preventing and punishing incitement to genocide and allowing humanitarian assistance into Gaza. Since then, the court has reaffirmed its provisional measures several times. The Israeli regime continues to ignore them.

And that is because on the international level, it continues to enjoy unprecedented diplomatic, financial and military cover. The latest iteration of that came on November 17 when the UN Security Council passed Resolution 2803, endorsing United States President Donald Trump’s 20-point plan for Gaza.

Among its provisions is the creation of two bodies that would take control of Gaza: the board of peace, chaired by Trump himself, and the international stabilisation force, tasked with maintaining security and enforcing the disarmament of Palestinian groups. The governing structure of both bodies remains unclear, but they would operate in coordination with the Israeli regime, effectively installing another layer of foreign control over the Palestinian people.

The resolution also allows for the bypassing of existing local and international structures in the distribution of aid. It makes no mention of the genocide and does not propose any mechanism for accountability for war crimes. Essentially, the resolution contravenes international law and gives the US – a co-perpetrator of genocide – control over Gaza.

All of this makes clear the fact that the “ceasefire” is not a ceasefire at all. The Israeli regime continues to attack Gaza, to starve the Palestinian population and to deny it access to proper shelter and healthcare.

Calling this arrangement a ceasefire allows third states to claim progress on conflict resolution and even peace when the core genocidal reality of the Palestinians on the ground remains largely unchanged. The “ceasefire” is a diplomatic sham – a cover for the continuing extermination, displacement and erasure of the Palestinian people in Gaza and a distraction for the international public and the media.

"Since the ceasefire was announced on October 10, the division of Gaza into a so-called “green zone” under Israeli army control and a so-called “red zone”, where Palestinians have been displaced and contained, has solidified. Separating the two is the invisible “yellow line”.

The administration of United States President Donald Trump has signalled that reconstruction will be limited to the “green zone” where Israel and its allies have been working on plans for so-called “alternative safe communities”.

Although there are reports last week that these plans were dropped, colleagues in the humanitarian field have informed me that the first such community is still slated to be built in Rafah, southern Gaza and a further 10 are planned along the yellow line and into the north.

If plans for these “safe communities” proceed, they would cement a deadly fragmentation of Gaza. The purpose of creating these camps is not to provide humanitarian relief but to create zones of managed dispossession where Palestinians would be screened and vetted to enter in order to receive basic services, but would be explicitly barred from returning to the off-limits and blockaded “red zone”.

These plans represent a recycled version of what Israel has long wanted to do in Gaza. The creation of “bubbles” – an initial, telling euphemism that I first heard proposed by the Israeli authorities when I was part of coordinating humanitarian operations in Palestine as a United Nations official – was the first iteration of areas where Palestinians would be screened and would be conditioned to receive controlled assistance.

This is the grim reality of the so-called ceasefire deal in Gaza. It will not deliver peace; it will further shatter Gaza and the prospect for Palestinian sovereignty into pieces. If anything, it is a Gaza piece plan.

On Monday this week, the United Nations Security Council voted to legitimise the plan by endorsing a board of peace to manage Gaza and an international stabilisation force (ISF) to provide security. But what areas will these forces secure? There is no agreed-upon peace for these forces to keep. According to maps I have seen of the “alternative safe communities”, the ISF would be positioned along the yellow line and would secure these newly established camps.

Hamas has unsurprisingly rejected the UNSC resolution. It was obvious that its provisions were not the outcome of a negotiated agreement. In the 20-point Trump plan, which was attached as an annex to the resolution, point 17 may now be invoked: “in the event Hamas delays or rejects this proposal, the above, including the scaled-up aid operations, will proceed in the terror-free areas handed over from the IDF [Israeli army] to the ISF”. In this way, the “alternative safe communities” may become the only enabled aid delivery centres, thereby prolonging the total blockade on Palestinians in Gaza.

The deadly logic of evacuation orders that marked the past two years and which drove Palestinians out of their homes, is now being extended into the UNSC-endorsed plan. Those who remain outside of the alternative communities, in the “red zone”, risk being labelled “Hamas supporters” and therefore ineligible for protection under Israel’s warped interpretation of international law and subject to ongoing military operations, as already seen in past days.

The fate of Palestinians in the “red zone” remains conspicuously absent from official planning. In fact, humanitarian organisations capable of saving lives are being squeezed out by an Israeli registration process designed to stifle criticism and vet staff for compliance.

The model of contained communities is not entirely new. The British created “new villages” in Malaya in the 1950s, the Americans created “strategic hamlets” in Vietnam in the 1960s, and the colonial authorities in Rhodesia (today’s Zimbabwe) created “protected villages” in the 1970s during so-called “counter-insurgency”.

Civilian populations were coerced and forced into camps where they were screened in return for aid. The plan was to diminish popular support for resistance groups who were fighting colonial rule. It failed.

In South Africa, the apartheid government created bantustans, pseudo-independent homelands designed to concentrate and control the Black population. They also failed to prevent the collapse of a settler-colonial apartheid regime.

In Gaza, the peace plan that has been imposed rather than negotiated will leave Israel’s occupation not only intact but emboldened. The UNSC has endorsed something that goes against the rulings of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on the occupied Palestinian territory, essentially whitewashing a genocidal crime scene and creating a monument to impunity.

All of this unfolds during a so-called ceasefire, in which Palestinians continue to be killed for crossing invisible lines drawn by an illegal occupation.

The world might hail this phase as an end to the war, and states reluctant to sanction Israel are undoubtedly relieved to revive trade and reduce public scrutiny.

Moving beyond this dangerous status quo will require the very accountability the US and Israel have worked hard to avoid: implementing the rulings of the ICJ. While Western powers hollow out these institutions, new political coalitions are needed to demand the equal application of international law. At its most basic level, this requires the unhindered delivery of humanitarian aid to Palestinians wherever they are in the strip and Palestinian-led reconstruction that ensures Palestinians are not perpetually condemned to bare survival.

The precedent set in Gaza would not be contained within the fences of Gaza’s gated communities sealed by international forces: it would further erode the foundations of a so-called rules-based order. The only way forward is a return to the principle this entire process has so far ignored: the inalienable right of a people to determine their own future.

"Three years back, Matt Maltese was in a casual co-writing session with some friends. Out of it came a song called Magnolias, a stripped back piano ballad about imagining his own funeral. “I didn’t think anything of it,” he says. “And then two years later, we heard some quite bizarre whispers that Rosalía had somehow heard it.” It was true: six months ago, Maltese was sent the Spanish pop star’s demo of the song. He tried not to get too excited, even when, a few weeks back, a blurred-out photo of a Rosalía album tracklisting appeared online. “On the WhatsApp group we were like: I think that says Magnolias!”

Magnolias ended up as the final track on Rosalía’s new operatic masterpiece, Lux: one of the most talked-about albums of the year, currently sitting in the UK Top 5. Maltese first heard the finished song the day the album came out, when he’d got back to London from a US tour. “I took a long jet-lagged walk and listened to the whole album to contextualise it. It’s extraordinary.” On Magnolias, Rosalía changed some words, he says, “and dramatised it incredibly. It’s exquisite. It’s a gift from someone, somewhere, that it fell into her lap.” It’s all anyone has wanted to talk to him about since. “I’ve had a lot of follow backs on Instagram,” he smiles.

The 30-year-old British-Canadian has quietly become a successful and influential figure. Across six solo albums since 2018, Maltese’s indie-pop balladry mixes a modern type of male sensitivity with the wry humour of his hero, Leonard Cohen. Aided by a viral TikTok moment, he has six million monthly listeners on Spotify and over 1bn streams combined; his latest album Hers, a lush distillation of longing and desire, was his first to chart.

It’s won him A-list fans in Sabrina Carpenter, Doja Cat, Frank Ocean, Laufey and BTS’s V, and made him a songwriter in demand. Maltese has written for and with artists such as Celeste, Joy Crookes, Jamie T and Tom Misch – even the Bard himself. Last year, Maltese wrote music for a Royal Shakespeare Company production of Twelfth Night in Stratford-upon-Avon. Next month it comes to the Barbican in London, where we meet by its lakeside terrace on an unseasonably warm afternoon. “Co-writing with Shakespeare,” he smiles. “That’s probably the best one, right?”

Growing up in Reading to Canadian parents, Maltese moved to London in his teens, falling into the “great community” of the burgeoning south London scene centred on the Brixton Windmill pub. But among alternative post-punk bands such as Goat Girl, Shame and Sorry, he was very much the odd one out. “I was like, I’m the soppiest one here. They’re ‘fuck the world’ and I’m like, ‘ah, but the world is such a nice thing’.”

In 2015 he signed to Atlantic Records off the back of promising Soundcloud demos. “They told me I was the voice of a generation.” But that didn’t save him when 2018 debut album Bad Contestant didn’t perform to Atlantic’s expectations. He was an ill fit for the major label system, he says: “As a snobbish 19-year-old, I said no to a lot of things.” He was once asked to cover John Lennon’s Happy Xmas (War is Over) for a BBC Christmas trailer. “And I insisted that I would only do it if I could record it in a minor key.” He starts laughing. “It was atrocious.” It never got used, and he was subsequently dropped. “But I needed that blow. I wasn’t treating it enough like a job.”

He looked at what was left of his £50,000 advance. “I worked out I had eight months before I’d have to quit music and get a job.” So he hibernated in his bedroom, sore from Atlantic’s rejection and “some messy personal relationship stuff”, and worked on songs. “That period was good for me because it made me comfortable in my own skin. It really made me write songs even more from the heart.” His independently released 2019 second album Krystal started a “positive spiral”.

His career really took off in 2021 when his 2017 track As the World Caves In, an apocalyptic ballad that imagined Donald Trump and Theresa May spending the last night on earth together, blew up on TikTok. Charli xcx and Shawn Mendes posted about it; on one “ridiculous day” it was the second most streamed song worldwide by a British artist behind Dua Lipa. After Atlantic, it was vindication, to a point. “They are making all the money from it,” he smiles ruefully: around £20,000 a week at the song’s height.

But it brought him a whole new fanbase. “It used to be divorced dads and students.” Now, he has screaming fans in the 18-23 age range. “Especially in America,” he says, where he’s just headlined the 5,900 capacity Greek theatre in Los Angeles. “But it’s so funny to self-identify that I’ve become a TikTok person. I think that skewed a lot of people’s impressions.”

Maltese’s real passion is the craft of songwriting. “I didn’t come out the womb with a mic on.” Hence his embrace of the co-writing sideline. Sometimes within a group – Magnolias was written in that session with Danny Casio, Sophie May and Daniel Wilson – but often intimately with the artist themselves.

He has a particularly close relationship with the chart-topping jazz-pop singer Celeste. “She’s great at disrupting the norm.” Once, uninspired by the expensive studio environment, she took him to a grotty rehearsal space. “It was January and it was freezing, a big dark room with no heating. We wrote there for a week.” They ended up with three songs for Celeste’s wonderful new album Woman of Faces – destined for the Top 10 this week – and the standalone track Everyday.

Joy Crookes is another artist Maltese is close to: after 2021’s Skin, he co-wrote Crookes’ 2025 single Mathematics. When he heard the finished track, he was amazed that UK rap legend Kano had added a guest verse. “I am a white boy from Reading; to have a credit with Kano is just insanity.” Even after Rosalía, Maltese is still getting used to his growing imprint on pop. “I don’t necessarily feel like I’m hugely culturally relevant. I’m just someone obsessed with songwriters from the 70s. I feel very lucky that people care.”",literal
"Just a few months ago, it seemed that the political landscape was changing permanently, with young people shifting right – especially young men. Democrats spun up a vortex of efforts to win them back, but they often appeared to be flailing. This month’s elections, however, told a different story.

Young men in the US face a political identity crisis. It should not be controversial to say that the world that many were promised as children has not come to fruition. Two decades of war and a turbulent economy have combined with a massively changing workforce. Young men’s disaffection should come as no real surprise.

An entire ecosystem of hucksters has emerged to take advantage of these young people, peddling a dark vision that offers violence and control as a response to a changing world. Meanwhile, the Democratic party failed to imagine a political future that included these young men. In Democrats’ parlance, anyone who took one step in that direction was hopelessly lost, unable to see the beautiful egalitarian future that we could create together.

There is a fine line here. I am not arguing for the redemption, welcome, or whitewashing of the people who have peddled this bleak reality. But we can and should build a political coalition that includes this generation, that doesn’t leave them out in the cold, only to find a home in the most bleak fringes of a political movement that tells them that a lust for control over other people, especially women, is the only way to find meaning.

On the left, we tell ourselves the story of our own vaunted sympathy, and yet we assign only blame to the young men who do something similar, looking for community and only finding it among the most opportunistic and dangerous political movements. We have done little to welcome them in.

And while Democrats had solid policies and economic plans, Republicans, backed by an army of digital content, were able to take the mantle of running on the economy and framing the left as cultural warriors out of touch with the majority of Americans.

But the good news is that this month’s elections in Virginia, New Jersey and New York City show Democrats have learned a lesson.

The three marquee campaigns of this year were all remarkably similar, despite coming from different parts of the ideological spectrum. Their messaging was relentlessly focused on affordability – how expensive and difficult life has become for the working and middle-class people of their communities. Their solutions covered a wide ideological range, but the focus remained the same.

Most young men, like most trans people and Black people and immigrants and everyone else, are dealing with housing that has skyrocketed in price, especially compared with our parents’ generations. Instead of having one career in our lifetimes, we now have to continually seek new jobs. Living independently as an adult is much more expensive and complicated now than it has been. These affordability campaigns gave young men something to do about those pressures rather than ceding that frustration to the most cynical actors.

Undoubtedly this conversation is easier to have when Donald Trump is taking three steps every day to dismantle the economy. There’s a real sense that the economy is getting worse. That it’s more difficult to pay bills and keep food on the table, especially when Republicans are, quite literally, ensuring that 42 million people cannot afford to keep food on their table by refusing to fund Snap during their government shutdown.

Republicans got distracted, trying to defend Trump and also trying to repeat his playbook of tying Democrats to the culture war of the moment. But without Trump’s singular ability to control a media narrative, Republicans with far less political talent and capital floundered, making themselves look weak and silly in the process.

The political miracle is that this ruthless focus on affordability and cost of living may have brought in many of those same young men who had followed Trump a year ago. In Virginia and New Jersey, men under 30 broke for their new Democratic governors, with about six in 10 supporting Spanberger, according to the AP. In New York, young men went for Zohran Mamdani over Andrew Cuomo by a margin of nearly 40 points, according to a Tufts Circle analysis.

It turns out that these young men are not completely lost to us. We just failed to imagine a reality where they could be in our camp.

Affordability broke through amid the longest government shutdown in US history, as consumer prices were rising ever higher thanks in part to Trump’s tariffs. For all of his bluster, eventually the economic reality becomes an unavoidable political crisis for anyone not far gone in his cult of personality who has to pay their bills.

Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey, Abigail Spanberger in Virginia, and Mamdani in New York City showed us that the frustration that every working and middle-class person feels could be directed into a political coalition that sees marginalized people as people also affected by the greed and corruption that has made life unaffordable for so many.

Young men, like everyone else, are looking for a politics that can make life a little better. Democrats are finally figuring out how to offer them that chance.",literal
"In June, President Donald Trump’s two older sons held an event at Trump Tower where they touted a new made-in-the-USA mobile phone with an American flag on its back, plus a new wireless service called Trump Mobile.

The phone was announced on the 10th anniversary of Trump’s presidential campaign launch and was the Trump brand’s first foray into mobile products and services. According to the initial announcement, the phone was supposed to be released in August.

But three months later, there are no signs that the phone has become a reality.

NBC News placed an order for a T1 phone in August, paying the $100 deposit for the purposes of tracking the $499 phone’s development.

After confirming with the credit card company that the transaction was not fraudulent, NBC News received a confirmation email verifying the order.

But the company provided no proactive updates after the order. NBC News made five separate phone calls to the Trump Mobile customer support line between September and November. At one point in October, the call operator promised a specific ship date: Nov. 13.

Justine Goode / NBC News; Getty Images

That date passed without an update, and when NBC News followed up with the call center, an operator said the delivery would now be in the “beginning of December,” with no specific date.

The operator cited the government shutdown as a reason for the delay, without further explanation.

Trump Mobile launched the T1 phone in tandem with a number of phone service offerings, including a 5G service plan priced at $47.45 per month — a nod to the president’s terms. In addition to unlimited talk, text and data, the plan promised “telehealth services, including virtual medical care.”

But since the original announcement, plans appear to be in flux. Quiet edits to the Trump Mobile website suggest that details around the phone’s design and production may have changed since it was announced.

The Trump Mobile website has scrubbed any mention of a specific release month, but continues to collect $100 down payments on the promise of availability “later this year.”

Neither Trump Mobile nor the Trump Organization responded to NBC News’ multiple requests for comment on when the phone would be released and why it’s delayed.

When the company announced the phone in June, photos on the website promised a phone featuring an iPhone-like cluster of three cameras on its back.

But in August, Trump Mobile’s X account posted, “The wait is almost over!” The post featured a photo of a supposed T1 phone with a completely different design, including more than three rear cameras.

The Verge reported that the phone appeared to be a render of a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra. When phone case company Spigen noticed that the photo appeared to be a doctored image of a Samsung in one of its cases, the company suggested it would sue.

NBC News has not been able to identify any lawsuit from Spigen, and the company has not responded to repeated requests for comment.

In late June, the same month the phone was announced, the website removed any mention of “Made in the USA,” as was originally promised.

Instead, the website now says the phone is “brought to life right here in the USA. With American hands behind every device,” and that the phone has “American-proud design.”

The T1 phone has been met with skepticism since its unveiling.

Smartphone industry insiders have suggested it’s nearly impossible to manufacture a “Made in the USA” smartphone on as quick a timeline as Trump Mobile has promised, and without some Chinese involvement.

Todd Weaver, the founder and CEO of Purism, a Carlsbad, California-based company that manufactures the only U.S.-made smartphone on the market, said that when his company started, there was “no skilled labor” in the U.S. capable of manufacturing a phone, and “nobody [had] done it before.”He said that creating a chain of production that would allow for a made-in-the-USA label was time and labor-intensive.

“We actually had to go over to China with our designs, to learn the process, the manufacturing process, to see what are all the steps,” Weaver said.

He said it took him six years to take his Liberty Phone from idea to production, which Purism sells at a $2,000 price point.

And even then, Liberty Phone isn’t entirely American-sourced, even if it is branded as “Made in the USA electronics.”

Most of its materials come from the United States, Canada or Europe. Other parts like the chassis are made in different countries, including China and India, according to the company.

If you or someone you know is in crisis, call or text 988 to reach the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline.

Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) often finds himself at odds with his party.

He's unapologetically pro-Israel. He spent the fall railing against the federal government shutdown and he, along with a few other Senate Democrats, broke from the party and struck a deal with Republicans.

""It's always been wrong for us to shut the government down,"" he told NPR. ""Rightly, [Democrats] criticize the Republicans when they've shut the government down. It's wrong. It's reckless.""

In an interview with All Things Considered host Scott Detrow, Fetterman posed a question to his critics: ""What exactly am I guilty of?""

""I suffered from depression and I made a recovery and I won an election,"" he said. ""And I went on to be an unapologetic supporter of Israel. And I happen to think that we have to have a secure border and I think it's wrong to shut our government down.""

Fetterman spoke with NPR in a conversation tied to his new memoir, Unfettered, about his 2022 Senate campaign that saw him suffer a stroke and fall into a deep depression.

The interview text below has been edited for length and clarity.

Interview highlights

Scott Detrow: This is a book about an election cycle where you suffered a stroke and you struggled with serious depression.

Sen. John Fetterman: Profound depression. Honestly, I know millions of Americans suffer from it.

And when you hear the expression that you can't get out of your bed — that's true.

Detrow: Last time I interviewed you, you had just returned to the Senate from Walter Reed [National Military Medical Center]. It was a pretty emotional conversation. You were still processing your treatment and what came next.

I wanted to ask a little bit about that because there's parts of this book where it seems like you're saying that you've, at times, regretted being so open about your mental health struggles. Is that accurate?

Fetterman: No. I don't regret it.

But people have been willing to use it or to create an impression that's just not true. And it's an honest conversation because a lot of people have had those things. And I've had a lot of people reach out to me over the years since and it's an honor to speak to people, to their experience, because sometimes people can feel alone.

Sponsor Message

And I've always wanted to make that conversation as simple as it can to just stay in this game. Because I've had people in my life make the decision to leave. And that's not a fail, they didn't fail. But that's a decision that they can't come back [from]. And how heartbreaking that is and how sad that is.

Detrow: You're talking about suicide.

Fetterman: Yeah, absolutely.

It's not a weakness. And that's [I want to be] a voice saying, ""hey, look, that's a lie. I don't know what your recovery looks like, but as long as you stay in it, I promise you you will get better.""

Detrow: I want to ask about Israel. You were very out front about [supporting Israel]. You never changed your tune. I'm wondering, as the Israeli attacks and bombing of Gaza continued, were there any points where you second guessed the place that you had staked yourself?

Fetterman: [Israel] had an opportunity to take out the Iranian nuclear facilities. I was the only Democrat that supported that. I was actually charging for those things. You know, that comes from Trump. Well, then I happen to agree with it. And now, can you imagine if they would have acquired a nuclear weapon there? And now what is behind this constant violence there? Is it Israel or it's because Iran funding these proxies like Hamas and Hezbollah doing these kinds of terrible things. And that war would have ended when you sent back all the hostages.

Detrow: So, at no point in the conflict did the balance shift for you as you thought about this in the context of 69,000 Palestinians dead?

Fetterman: No one breaks down how many actual Hamas fighters or other people that were involved in that. So, we're not really sure.

The only time you see members in Hamas is when they're handing over funerals and rallying. Otherwise, they embed themselves in the civilians and they were forced to fight a war through an urban situation.

Why can't people condemn putting tunnels under hospitals and embedding themselves in where civilians are? And you know, because they can't fight a real war. So, that's why they use civilians as human shields. And that's the tragedy.

"Gather 'round the table — it's time for a 'Family Feast!'

Illustrations copyright © 2025 by FRANK MORRISON / Crown Books for Young Readers

Author Carole Boston Weatherford and illustrator Frank Morrison almost can't stop joking with each other long enough to talk about their new picture book.

""Some like to think we're a winning combination,"" says Boston Weatherford. ""Of course, it's all because of me,"" she laughs, but Morrison quickly agrees. ""Of course, of course,"" he says. ""You always keep me on my game.""

Their first children's book together was 2019's The Roots of Rap. They were paired up because of Morrison's background in the hip-hop industry. ""I started hip-hop dancing and then I started club dancing,"" he explains. This was back in the 1980s, and he went on tour to Europe. ""That was a big part of my life and it kind of changed my scope on art as well,"" Morrison says, ""because I had a chance to go to the Louvre while I was out there… looking at the 'Mona Lisa,' you think, 'Oh, I thought it'd be bigger,' but my gosh, it's beautiful.""

Now, Frank Morrison and Carole Boston Weatherford have finished their sixth book together. In Family Feast!, the day begins early for Big Ma and Pops, who spend the morning peeling fruit for a pie and dressing the fish to fry. When aunts, uncles, cousins, sisters and brothers arrive, everyone gathers in the kitchen to cook, share recipes, gossip, catch up, shoot the breeze and lick the bowls. Boston Weatherford says that everyone brings something different to the party, ""whether it's a dish or, you know, somebody got to be the joke master or the storyteller.""

""Family Feast! is inspired by the gatherings in my own family,"" says Boston Weatherford. Even the little dog in the book is modeled after her beagle. And even though there's a turkey on the table, this book could be about Thanksgiving, Christmas, Easter or even any old weekend. ""It kind of shows the conversation, the chaos and the culinary creations that come out of these family feasts,"" she says.

Frank Morrison says his relatives used to gather for feasts just like this one every Sunday. ""I felt like I was reading what happened over the weekend with my family,"" he adds.

Morrison illustrated the book in warm, earthy, autumnal colors. ""It kind of looks like the leaves on the tree,"" he explains. ""I just want it to feel warm [like] when you come into the house after a cold night.""

The yellow kitchen is inviting, Pops has a Santa beard and a smile from ear to ear, there's plates and plates of delicious-looking food and kids bounce around the floor. It's crowded and chaotic: everybody is in everybody else's business and it looks like a really fun party.

""These family gatherings, they're not just about food, but they're about love,"" says Carole Boston Weatherford. ""The food that's cooked is an expression of love, even if it's just ginger ale and paper cups from the grocery store. And everything that goes on in the conversations, even the chaos: it's all about love.""",figurative
"Special Section: Generative Artificial Intelligence

What audiences see and hear from NPR has always been, and always will be, the product of human beings. NPR has also always been a leader in finding creative uses for new technology. If used thoughtfully, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) is a tool that may be able to help us fulfill our mission as journalists, become more efficient in our work, and possibly help free staff up to do things that are more creative and critical to advancing our journalism.

Guideline: You are responsible for the content you create, with or without the use of GAI.

Plagiarism and accuracy are major concerns with GAI which scrapes the Internet for information and material, and uses that material to generate seemingly new products. We should always assume that what GAI comes up with is not original, and we don't know to what extent it is simply plagiarizing. If you use GAI to help you with your work, you are ultimately responsible for the content of that work and that includes making sure you are not plagiarizing. We must also check to ensure that the information GAI delivers is accurate and reliably sourced. We cannot assume that the information it delivers is correct.

As technology evolves our use of it will evolve as well, but our use will always be within the framework of the standards that guide all of our journalism.

Guideline: Don't rely on GAI to include all angles of a story.

GAI doesn't know what it doesn't know. As journalists we constantly question our assumptions, one of the most important being: Have we included all of the viewpoints and aspects of the story we are covering? We have a responsibility to make sure we are looking at every issue from multiple viewpoints. If you are using GAI as a reporting tool it may well miss important aspects of a story. It's important that you be aware of that potential shortcoming throughout any reporting process that includes the use of GAI.

Guideline: GAI can't check its own biases, that's your job.

GAI has no sense of ethics or morals. Those must come from you; the user and you will be expected to ensure that anything you produce using GAI conforms to the standards laid out in this handbook.

GAI may seem autonomous, but it is the product of human beings. As such, it shares and can exacerbate the biases of those who created and programmed it as well as the biases of the material that was used to train it. As we use it we must be on the lookout for those biases just as we always must look out for our own biases, those of our sources and those of our colleagues.

Guideline: If GAI played a significant role in your reporting you should share that fact with your audience.

As the main transparency section of this handbook says, ""We reveal as much as we practically can about how we discover and verify the facts we present."" As we do with the other aspects of our journalism, if GAI plays a significant role in the reporting of a story we should reveal that fact to our audience. If you're not sure whether your use of GAI was significant enough to include in your story, discuss it with your editor, a Managing Editor, or the ME for Standards and Practices.

Guideline: We must protect our own work.

Because GAI systems learn from data, they may take anything we put into them and add it to their knowledge base. As a result, no NPR employee should ever put any of NPR's intellectual property into any GAI system without NPR's prior consent. NPR's intellectual property includes everything you have created in the process of your work — from your notes, to your draft of a story, to memos about coverage ideas.

Also, keep in mind that, under current law, material produced by GAI cannot be copyrighted. While the courts have yet to clarify exactly how much human input is needed, there must be some human-generated content for something to be copyrightable. Facts themselves are not copyrightable and the human content needs to be creative — more than simply adding facts to something that was on AI. NPR has an interest in ensuring that content we create is copyrightable, so if you wish to use GAI to create content, please consult the OGC (Office of General Counsel) first to determine how NPR can best protect its interests in such instances.

Guideline: GAI when used correctly can help us be better journalists.

GAI does, however, open up a whole realm of possibilities. It is a great tool for some tasks that are ""hard to do but easy to verify,"" such as finding patterns in statistics or finding synonyms. In these early days, we are asking those who use GAI to help in editorial work to get prior approval from the Managing Editor for Standards and Practices. As we work with it, we will become more familiar with what it can and cannot be used for. Our review policies will likely change, as will this guidance.

There will no doubt be other media that attempt to use GAI to generate content. We may soon see a two-tiered media landscape with some media trying to use GAI to replace humans. Other media, including NPR, are choosing to keep humans firmly in control. Keeping that control will mean we are upholding our journalistic standards even as we find ways of incorporating GAI into our work.",literal
"Racism and economic insecurity can have a close relationship in this country. That is most apparent when Australia finds itself pulled into another so-called “debate” about migration. This is usually sparked by populism or attempts to blame complex issues like housing affordability on our annual migrant intake.

Across the country, recent rallies and commentary are blaming migrants for a range of woes, from the cost of living to housing supply. Politicians from various sides made similar claims prior to the last federal election. We’re seeing a rise in far-right parties platformed on anti-immigration rhetoric and racism. This rhetoric feeds on genuine economic concerns but ignores the structural forces driving economic insecurity and undermines the right to dignity, security and equality for all.

The Coalition is reported to be working on a new policy to cut migration. There is nothing wrong with discussing migration levels. The issue is when we are not having honest discussions about the rights to housing, decent social security benefits and fair wages. The debate needs to be courageous enough to require the wealthy and corporations to give fairly to help realise those rights and to interrogate a crisis of systemic inequality.

Taking the easy but misleading route of blaming migrants for economic insecurity only serves to stoke the already smouldering fires of racism. Migrants are dehumanised in this debate, and this racism has harmful impacts on their daily lives.

When commentary repeatedly frames migrants as a burden, a threat or the reason for economic hardship, it reinforces stereotypes that have real consequences. It ignores the fact that migration has been a bedrock of our economic success and that migrants on average contribute far more than they receive. Such narratives have historically paved the way for cuts to social security for all, harsher migration policies and a political climate where compassion is treated as weakness. They shape public fear, not public understanding. And when fear grows, racism grows with it. We must ask ourselves: who benefits when communities are set against each other?

3:33 Factchecking protesters' claims of 'mass migration' into Australia – video

For example, when racism is embedded in migration systems through visa uncertainty or inadequate workplace protection, it enables exploitation. Some employers take advantage of the fact that migrant workers may fear deportation or visa cancellation if they speak up. This means they can be paid less, work longer hours, or accept unsafe conditions as a means of survival. But this is not a “migrant problem”. It is a structural problem that affects the entire labour market. Underpayment in one part of the workforce drags wages down across the economy. It creates a false sense of job scarcity. It pits workers against each other while employers benefit. Migrant workers lose. Local workers lose. The only winners are those who profit from division and vulnerability.

If we truly care about lifting living standards, improving wages and building a fairer future for everyone, then we must tackle the root causes of economic insecurity rather than scapegoat those who contribute enormously to our society. One of the ways of doing this is for the federal government to endorse the national anti-racism framework which marks its one year anniversary this week. Strengthening wage protections, ensuring migrant workers can safely report exploitation and enforcing fair work laws – including a ‘positive duty’ where the onus is on employers to protect workers from racial discrimination – all benefit the entire workforce. When workers feel secure, when wages rise, when housing is affordable, when communities are thriving, racism loses its grip, and everyone wins.

We need to focus on the systems that create poverty, instead of stigmatising people for being disadvantaged by them. If we tackle the real and complex problems that cause economic insecurity, we can reduce racism, while making systems fairer for everyone. Migration has always been part of Australia’s story. What matters now is whether we use it as a political tool that drives us apart and obscures the real problems, or whether we choose leadership that brings people together and improves the lives of all.",figurative
"When US President Donald Trump declared that South Africa “should not even be” in the G20 and then took to Truth Social on November 7 to announce that no American official would attend this year’s summit in Johannesburg on account of a so-called “genocide” of white farmers in the country, I was not surprised. His outburst was not an exception but the latest expression of a long Western tradition of disciplining African sovereignty. Western leaders have long tried to shut down African agency through mischaracterisations, from branding Congolese nationalist Patrice Lumumba a “Soviet puppet” to calling anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela a “terrorist”, and Trump’s assault on South Africa falls squarely into that pattern.

As Africa pushes for a stronger voice in global governance, the Trump administration has intensified efforts to isolate Pretoria. South Africa’s growing diplomatic assertiveness, from BRICS expansion to climate finance negotiations, has challenged conservative assumptions that global leadership belongs exclusively to the West.

On February 7, Trump signed an executive order halting US aid to South Africa. He alleged that the government’s land expropriation policy discriminates against white farmers and amounts to uncompensated confiscation. Nothing could be further from the truth. South African law permits expropriation only through due process and compensation, with limited exceptions set out in the Constitution. Trump’s claims ignore this legal reality, revealing a deliberate preference for distortion over fact.

Soon after, the administration amplified its rollout of a refugee admissions policy that privileged Afrikaners, citing once again discredited claims of government persecution. What is clear is that Washington has deliberately heightened tensions with Pretoria, searching for any pretext to cast South Africa as an adversary. This selective compassion, extended only to white South Africans, exposes a racialised hierarchy of concern that has long shaped conservative engagement with the continent.

Yet, for months, South African officials have firmly rejected these claims, pointing to judicial rulings, official statistics, and constitutional safeguards that show no evidence of systematic persecution, let alone a “genocide” of white farmers. Indeed, as independent experts repeatedly confirmed, there is no credible evidence whatsoever to support the claim that white farmers in South Africa are being systematically targeted as part of a campaign of genocide. Their rebuttals highlight a basic imbalance: Pretoria is operating through verifiable data and institutional process, while Washington relies on exaggeration and ideological grievance.

At the same time, as host of this year’s G20 Summit, Pretoria is using the platform to champion a more cooperative and equitable global order. For South Africa, chairing the G20 is not only symbolic, but strategic, an attempt to expand the influence of countries long excluded from shaping the rules of global governance.

Trump’s G20 boycott embodies a transnational crusade shaped by Christian righteousness. Trump’s rhetoric reduces South Africa to a moral backdrop for American authority rather than recognising it as a sovereign partner with legitimate aspirations. The boycott also mirrors a wider effort to discredit multilateral institutions that dilute American exceptionalism.

This stance is rooted in a long evangelical-imperial tradition, one that fused theology with empire and cast Western dominance as divinely sanctioned. The belief that Africa required Western moral rescue emerged in the nineteenth century, when European missionaries declared it a Christian duty to civilise and redeem the continent. The wording has changed, but the logic endures, recasting African political agency as a civilisational error rather than a legitimate expression of sovereignty. This moralised paternalism did not disappear with decolonisation. It simply adapted, resurfacing whenever African nations assert themselves on the world stage.

American evangelical and conservative Christian networks wield significant influence inside the Republican Party. Their political and media ecosystem, featuring Fox News and the Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN), routinely frames multilateral institutions, global aid, and international law as subordinate to American sovereignty and Christian civilisation. These networks shape not only rhetoric but policy, turning fringe narratives into foreign policy priorities.

They also amplify unproven claims of Christian persecution abroad, particularly in countries such as Nigeria and Ethiopia, to legitimise American political and military interference. Trump’s fixation with South Africa follows the same script: a fabricated crisis crafted to thrill, galvanise, and reassure a conservative Christian base. South Africa becomes another stage for this performance.

In this distorted narrative, South Africa is not a constitutional democracy acting through strong, independent courts and institutions. Instead, Africa’s most developed country is stripped of its standing and portrayed as a flawed civilisation in need of Western correction. For conservative Christian nationalists, African decision-making is not autonomous agency but a supervised privilege granted only when African decisions align with Western priorities.

By casting South Africa as illegitimate in the G20, invoking false claims of genocide and land seizures, and penalising Pretoria’s ICJ case with aid cuts, Trump asserts that only the West can define global legitimacy and moral authority, a worldview anchored in Christian-nationalist authority. Trump’s crusade is punishment, not principle, and it seeks to deter African autonomy itself.

On many occasions, I have walked the streets of Alexandra, a Johannesburg township shaped by apartheid’s spatial design, where inequality remains brutally vivid. Alexandra squeezes more than one million residents into barely 800 hectares (about 2,000 acres). A significant portion of its informal housing sits on the floodplain of the Jukskei River, where settlements crowd narrow pathways and fragile infrastructure. Here, the consequences of structural inequality are unmistakable, yet they vanish entirely within Trump’s constructed crisis.

These communities sit only a few kilometres from Sandton, a spacious, leafy, and affluent suburb that is home to some of the country’s most expensive properties. The vast and entrenched gulf between these adjacent lands is essentially a living symbol of the profound inequality Trump is willing to overlook and legitimise as a global norm, built on selective moral outrage and racialised indifference.

In Alexandra, the struggle for dignity, equality, and inclusion is not a religious American fantasy, but a practical quest for the rights that apartheid and wider global injustice sought to deny. Their struggle mirrors the wider global fight against structures that concentrate wealth and power in a few hands. They, too, deserve better.

This is the human condition Trump’s pseudo-morality refuses to acknowledge. This is why South Africa’s global leadership matters.

Earlier this year, South Africa’s President Cyril Ramaphosa commissioned a landmark G20 Global Inequality Report, chaired by Nobel-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz. It found that the world’s richest 1 percent have captured more than 40 percent of new wealth since 2000 and that more than 80 percent of humanity now lives in conditions the World Bank classifies as high inequality.

The Johannesburg G20 Summit seeks to reform multilateral development banks, such as the World Bank, to confront a global financial system that sidelines developing countries and perpetuates economic injustice. While South Africa turns to recognised multilateral tools such as the ICJ and G20 reform, the US has moved in the opposite direction.

Under Trump, Washington has sanctioned the International Criminal Court, abandoned key UN bodies, and rejected scrutiny from UN human rights experts, reflecting a Christian-nationalist doctrine that treats American power as inherently absolute and answerable to no one.

South Africa offers an alternative vision rooted in global cooperation, shared responsibility, equality, and adherence to international law, a vision that unsettles those invested in unilateral power. The US recasts decolonisation as sin, African equality as disruption, and American dominance as divinely ordained. Trump’s attacks reveal how deeply this worldview still shapes American foreign policy.

Yet the world has moved beyond colonial binaries. African self-determination can no longer be framed as immoral. Human rights are universal, and dignity belongs to us all.

"My son loved his first day of kindergarten. It brings up my own bittersweet memories

toggle caption Ben de la Cruz/NPR

Millions of children across the United States are stepping into kindergarten for the first time. My son is one of them.

It's emotional for any parent — watching your child take those steps into the world, into routine, into independence. For immigrant parents like my wife and me, it was overwhelming.

My son, Russell Siima, started the first year of his primary education in a public school in Montgomery County, Md. My wife and I dropped my son off, his baby brother in tow. We waved goodbye and encouraged him to be brave. His classroom has colorful posters, smart boards and cozy reading corners filled with books and comfy swivel chairs. Each child has a cubby with their name on it for storing the school supplies tucked into their backpacks.

Sponsor Message

Like every parent, I hope my child likes — no, make that loves — their teacher. That they feel welcome in school and enjoy their first step to the many years of learning ahead.

But as my son marks this milestone, I have mixed emotions. I am so excited about his schooling. Then I flash back to my own first day, in my home country of Uganda. It was a very different experience.

toggle caption Ben de la Cruz/NPR

When I was 4, my mother sent me to another county in rural southwestern Uganda — to live with my uncle's family, where school options were better. In my home county, the nearest ""church school"" was about 9 miles away – too great a distance for a child to walk. I began my education in what we called ""church school."" Used for Sunday mass, the building itself was a long, rectangular room with a dirt floor, no ceiling and wooden shutters instead of glass windows. A row of concrete pillars held up the tin roof. When it rained, the noise was so deafening that classes had to pause.

On my first day at church school, my cousin Mary and her older brother walked with me the mile or so to school and dropped me off.

Sponsor Message

I was only at that school for a year before I transferred to Katebe Primary School — the best in the county. It gave me a solid foundation for learning. But it wasn't ideal. When I tell my American friends that our first job every morning was to sweep the classroom before we sat down, they chuckle. For me, it was serious business — it taught me to take care of the space around me, to be responsible even with very little.

Yet I dreamed of one day coming to a classroom where the only thing I had to carry was curiosity.

My dream came true in the fall of 2004. I arrived in Florida from Uganda as a 19-year-old, fresh off the plane, stepping foot into my first American classroom at Tallahassee Community College. I had been adopted by a generous Floridian couple — Russell and Cheri Rainey — who, after meeting me in Uganda and hearing about my passion for education, decided to bring me into their family. They became Mom and Dad.

toggle caption Ben de la Cruz/NPR

I remember that first semester, wide-eyed as I walked the campus of 15,000 students, marveling at the library, the technology and the professors who deeply cared about my curiosity. I used to sit in those classrooms thinking: One day, I hope my children — indeed all kids — get to have this kind of opportunity.

I graduated top of my class, was unanimously selected to give the 2006 commencement address at the Leon Tucker Civic Center, earned a scholarship to Florida State University and, later, graduate school.

So last week, standing in a kindergarten hallway beside my wife — watching our firstborn take his first steps into formal schooling at age five — we were moved beyond words. The school had so many resources — a fully stocked library, a music room, an art room, shelves of learning materials.

Sponsor Message

In Uganda, schools with these kinds of resources are virtually inaccessible to the average child. They're reserved for maybe two percent of the population — mostly the children of wealthy families, high-earning businesspeople or government elites.

To us, it felt like witnessing a dream we'd carried quietly for years — one we wish every child, not just our own, could one day live.

toggle caption Ben de la Cruz/NPR

In that moment, we knew: every sacrifice we've made, every mile we've walked — literally and figuratively — had led to this. And it was worth it.

Life, sometimes, comes full circle.

This moment reminded me of something deeply personal: that showing up as a father, being present, is a quiet miracle many take for granted. I never had my dad there for school drop-off.

My father was alive during my early years but mostly absent in my life — working far from home, present only on holidays. By the time I was ten, he had died. Between 1988 and 1992, I lost both my parents and three siblings. I was part of a generation of Ugandan children left behind by the HIV/AIDS epidemic, raised by my grandmother.

On my son's first day in kindergarten, I got to be there.

I also remembered those who made this possible — my Ugandan mother, who sent me away so I could learn; my grandmother, who raised me when no one else could; and the Raineys, whose act of kindness unlocked a future I once thought impossible. There's a saying from Africa: One act of generosity can unlock a thousand doors. I'm living proof. And now, so is my son.

Too many children around the world don't get this chance. Children in refugee camps, war zones and neglected communities.

I pray every child gets a first day like this — full of love, nerves, curiosity and hope. I pray that every parent, no matter where they come from, gets the chance to witness it.

"Three fighters and three security personnel killed in attack on the Federal Constabulary headquarters in Peshawar, media reports say.

Three suicide attackers have attacked the headquarters of a paramilitary force in the Pakistani city of Peshawar, killing at least three security personnel and wounding several others.

The Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, which is a splinter group of the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), or the Pakistan Taliban, claimed responsibility for Monday’s attack on the headquarters of the Federal Constabulary (FC).

The TTP is separate from the Taliban that governs Afghanistan, but they are allies.

“Initially, three militants tried to attack the headquarters,” Peshawar Capital City Police Officer Mian Saeed Ahmad told the Dawn newspaper.

“One bomber blew himself up on the gate while two others tried to enter the premises but were gunned down by FC personnel,” he added.

Asim Khan, a spokesperson at the government-run Lady Reading Hospital, was quoted by The Associated Press news agency as saying all 11 people wounded in the attack were listed in stable condition.

Al Jazeera’s Kamal Hyder, reporting from Peshawar, said the attackers were trying to target more than 400 security personnel who were conducting a parade at the headquarters.

“Senior officials were expected at that particular headquarters, so the attackers were trying to maximise the number of casualties,” Hyder said.

“However, they were intercepted, … and all three were killed, and in the process, three security forces personnel also died,” he said.

Hyder added that the public has been apprehensive due to a recent spike in attacks in Pakistan as the security forces have ramped up their operations against TTP members, killing dozens of them in the past several days.

The targeted headquarters is located in a densely populated area of Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

Pakistani leaders slam attack

President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in separate statements, condemned the attack.

Zardari called it a “cowardly act by foreign-backed terrorists”.

In a post on X, he offered “heartfelt condolences” and praised the courage of the security forces.

Sharif said the swift response of security forces prevented a larger tragedy, adding: “We will thwart the evil designs of terrorists who attack Pakistan’s integrity.”

The latest attack came less than two weeks after a suicide bomber struck outside a court in Pakistan’s capital, Islamabad, detonating explosives next to a police car and killing 12 people.

"'What to Eat Now' nutritionist talks SNAP, food policy and the 'triple duty' diet

toggle caption Allison Dinner/AP

Nutrition policy expert Marion Nestle says that when she wrote her first book, Food Politics, in 2002, people often asked her what food had to do with politics.

""Nobody asks me that anymore,"" Nestle says. ""When I look at what's happening with food assistance I'm just stunned.""

Nestle says the Trump administration's efforts to withhold SNAP benefits from millions of Americans has made clear how fragile our economy is: ""We have 42 million people in this country — 16 million of them children — who can't rely on a consistent source of food from day to day and have to depend on a government program that provides them with benefits that really don't cover their food needs, only cover part of their food needs.""

Decades of studying the food industry have given Nestle a clear-eyed view of why food has become difficult to afford — including the ways supermarkets contribute to the problem. ""The purpose of a supermarket is to sell as much food as possible to as many people as possible, as often as possible at as higher prices they can get away with,"" she says.

Nestle's 2006 book, What to Eat, became a consumer bible of sorts when it came out, guiding readers through the supermarket while exposing how industry marketing and policy steer our food choices. Now, two decades later, she's back with What to Eat Now, a revised field guide for the supermarket of 2025.

Nestle recommends what she called a ""triple duty"" diet aimed at preventing hunger, obesity and climate change: ""Eat real food, processed as little as possible, with a big emphasis on plants,"" she says.

On how supermarkets are in the business of selling products, not providing nutrition

The more products you see, the more you're likely to buy. Therefore, the products that are organized so that you cannot miss them are in prime supermarket real estate. And companies pay the supermarkets to place their products at eye level, at the ends of aisles — those have a special name, end caps — and at the cash register. When you see products at the catch register, they're paying fees to the supermarket by the inch of space. And that's how supermarkets make a lot of their money, is through slotting fees. And, of course, what this does is it keeps small producers out, because they can't afford to make those kinds of payments. ... I mean, we're talking about thousands, or in some cases, hundreds of thousands of dollars. And every single product that is in a supermarket is placed where it is for a reason.

On how dollar stores got into the food business

They started out by selling the most popular ultra-processed foods. ... They're going to have chips. They're going to have sugar-sweetened cereals. They're going to have every junk food you could possibly think of. That's what they make their money off of. They will have a few fruits and vegetables, a few sad bananas, a few sad apples, maybe some pears, maybe some green vegetables, but not very many, and they'll be in a case off somewhere because they have to offer those. Because they're taking SNAP benefits, they're required to meet the stocking requirements of the SNAP program, which requires them to have a certain number of fruits and vegetables. … And [dollar stores are] just everywhere. And during the pandemic, particularly, they just proliferated like mad, and they undercut local stores. They're cheaper. They have poorer quality food, but the prices are lower. Price is an enormous issue.

If you want a Trader Joe's or a Whole Foods or a Wegmans in your neighborhood, you've got to have hundreds of thousands of people within walking distance or quick driving distance who make very, very good incomes or the [people] aren't gonna go there. They're going to close the stores that are not performing well, meaning having lots and lots of people spending lots and lots of money at them. And so as the big grocery stores have closed in inner city neighborhoods, the dollar stores moved in.

On food waste in America

Our food system in the United States produces 4,000 calories a day for every man, woman and little tiny baby in the country. That's roughly twice what the population needs on average. So waste is built into the system. Because that's how the subsidies work. The agricultural subsidies encourage food producers to produce as much food as possible because they get paid for the amount of food that they produce.

On initially agreeing with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s ""Make America Healthy Again"" approach to the food industry

I was very hopeful when he was appointed, because he was talking about, let's get the toxins out of the food supply. Let's make America healthy again. Let's make America's kids healthy again. Let's do something about ultra-processed foods. Let's do something about mercury and fish. And a lot of other issues that I thought, ""Oh, how absolutely terrific that we're going to have somebody who cares about the same kind of issues I do. This is very exciting.""

When President Trump introduced his nomination of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on social media, President Trump talked about the food industrial complex. I nearly fell off my chair! I thought, ""Here's the president sounding just like me. What's going on here?"" So then we had the first MAHA report, the first Make America Healthy Again report, which talked about a lot of these issues and put in an aspirational agenda. ""We're going to work on this, this and this"" — all of that sounded terrific. And then the second report came out and they had backed off on nearly all of the things that I thought were really critically important.

On why she believes the food system needs a revolution

toggle caption Peter Menzel

I think it would start with transforming our agricultural production system to one that was focused on food for people instead of animals and automobiles. We would need to change our electoral system so that we could elect officials who were interested in public health rather than corporate health. We would need to fix our economy so that Wall Street favors corporations who have social values and public health values as part of their corporate mission. Those are revolutionary concepts at this point because they seem so far from what is attainable. But I think if we don't work on that now, if we do not do what we can to advocate for a better food system, we won't get it. And it's only if we advocate for it that we have a chance of getting it. And you never know, sometimes you get lucky. …

I tell people that they can't do it on their own, that even the act of going into a grocery store and trying to make healthy choices means that you, as an individual, are up against an entire food system that is aimed at getting you to eat the most profitable foods possible, regardless of their effects on health and the environment. So you have to join organizations. You have to join with other people who are interested in the same issues and concerned about the same problems and get together with them to set some goals for what you'd like to do and then work towards those goals. Because if you don't do it, who will?

"The 30th conference of the parties (Cop30), the annual climate summit of all nations party to the UNFCCC, just ended. Stakeholders are out in the media trying spin the outcome as a win. Simon Stiell, climate change executive secretary for the UN is, for instance, praising Cop30 for showing that “climate cooperation is alive and kicking, keeping humanity in the fight for a liveable planet”. But let us be clear. The conference was a failure. Its outcome, the decision text known as the Global Mutirão or Global Collective Effort, is, in essence, a form of climate denial.

In 2023, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) determined that the world had already developed, or planned to develop, too much fossil fuel to be able to halt global heating at 2C. It acknowledged that the capital assets built up around fossil fuels must be stranded – that is to say, abandoned and not used – if warming was to be limited to 2C. But the Cop30 decision text ignores all this. Indeed, it never even mentions fossil fuels.

This failure is all the more bitter because Cop30 had initially sent out so many hopeful signals that it would finally tackle the “transitioning away from fossil fuels” pledge from Cop28. Speaking ahead of the conference, the Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, said that the world needs “roadmaps that will enable humankind, in a fair and planned manner, to overcome its dependence on fossil fuels”.

Lula’s call was backed by about 90 other nations. “This is a global coalition, with global north and global south countries coming together and saying with one voice: this is an issue which cannot be swept under the carpet,” said the UK’s energy secretary, Ed Miliband.

After a press conference where 20 ministers and climate envoys demanded that the proposed language on the roadmap in the first draft text be “strengthened” and adopted, the EU circulated its own proposal for incorporating the roadmap in the final text.

By Friday, the number of countries supporting the roadmap to fossil-fuel phaseout rose to 89. Yet any reference to it disappeared from the second draft that dropped on the same day. Thanks to Cop30, the fossil fuel era will simply continue.

It seems clear that the petrostates, led by Russia and Saudi Arabia, fought against fossil fuel phaseout and won. If they feel the phaseout is an existential threat to their economies and their sovereignty, perhaps they should consider how the climate crisis is rendering the Middle East uninhabitable. The very week of Cop30, Iran’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, announced that Tehran, Iran’s capital city of 16 million, would need to be abandoned and re-established elsewhere, because, after years of climate-fuelled drought, its water has finally run out.

Surely these states are being supported in their fossil-fuel authoritarianism by Donald Trump, who is the president of the world’s largest producer of fossil fuels and who calls the climate crisis a “con job”. Even though the US was officially absent from the negotiations, Trump’s alliance with Saudi Arabia, and seeming affinity for Russia, underwrites their ability to advance their own energy interests.

Yet would this power be as great if the world’s “climate leaders” had more courage? It is remarkable that at the very moment the EU was supposedly fighting to include a roadmap to fossil fuel phaseout in the Cop decision, Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, was telling a press conference at the G20 that “we are not fighting fossil fuels, we are fighting the emissions from fossil fuels.” Not only does this statement directly undermine her own negotiators’ positions, it is in itself nonsensical – akin to saying “we are not giving up eating ice-cream, we are giving up absorbing the calories from that ice-cream.”

More to the point, von der Leyen’s language echoed nearly verbatim the words of Osama Faqeeha, deputy environment minister for Saudi Arabia, who told a journalist asking about the Cop30 roadmap that “the issue is the emissions, it’s not the fuel”. It has long been the position of the Saudis that the world could continue to use fossil fuels and simply remove the economy’s 600m metric tonnes of annual carbon-dioxide emissions with carbon-dioxide removal. But this is nothing more than fossil-fuel propaganda.

For one thing, the amount of CO2 that can be stored safely underground is limited. That the president of the commission repeats such nonsense reveals why attempts like Cop30 repeatedly fail: so-called climate leaders in fact evince deep ambivalence about phasing out fossil fuels, ultimately unifying global climate politics around the lie that we can keep using fossil fuels and still deal with the climate crisis.

But what of China? Isn’t China becoming the world’s first electrostate, stepping into the role of global climate leader with the US embracing fossil authoritarianism? Well, China seems to be ambivalent too, at least for now. China did not block the text on the roadmap to fossil-fuel phaseout, but neither did it fight to make sure it was included. Despite its dominance in solar, wind and electric vehicles, China acts less as a climate leader and more as an “all of the above” energy powerhouse, devoted first and foremost to its own economic development.

One bright spot of Cop30 is that Colombia and the Netherlands, backed by 22 nations, will independently advance a roadmap to fossil fuel phaseout, beginning with a conference in April 2026. This conference could be a gamechanger. UN rules require all Cop decision texts to be approved unanimously, giving the petrostates veto power over global climate politics. The creation of a fossil-fuel roadmap outside the Cop process may establish a trading bloc that could begin to sanction nations – and banks – that refuse to wind down fossil fuels.

Such a bloc will have no power if its leaders are not forced to resolve their ambivalence about phasing out fossil fuels. And that’s where you and I come in. All of us must do our part and subject world leaders to extreme and relentless public pressure. The challenge of stranding potentially trillions of dollars in fossil capital and rebuilding the world is enormous. Of course, global leaders and officials will take the easier, cowardly road if they can get away with it. As we cross the 1.5C threshold into uncharted climatic territory, we must make them fight wholeheartedly for fossil fuel phaseout. In the end, it is up to us to create a global politics that will finally save the world for our children.",literal
"Venezuela doesn’t even produce fentanyl, but Washington is still going forward with regime change efforts in Caracas as part of its ‘war on drugs’.

On Saturday, the Reuters news agency published an exclusive report claiming that the United States is “poised to launch a new phase of Venezuela-related operations in the coming days”. The report cited four US officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. Two of the officials said covert operations would likely be the first step in this “new action” against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.

This was less than shocking news given that more than a month ago, US President Donald Trump himself announced that he had authorised the CIA to conduct covert operations in Venezuela – a rather unique approach since one does not normally broadcast actions that are supposed to be, um, secret.

Anyway, it’s no secret that the US has been overseeing a massive military build-up in the region with about 15,000 US troops currently stationed there under the guise of fighting “narcoterrorism”. Since early September, Trump has also presided over wanton extrajudicial executions in the Caribbean Sea, repeatedly ordering the bombing of what he claims are drug-trafficking boats.

In addition to violating both international and US law, the strikes have produced little to show for themselves beyond terrorising local fishermen.

To be sure, the US has never met a “war on drugs” it didn’t love, given the convenient opportunities the whole drug-war narrative offers for wreaking havoc worldwide, militarising the Western Hemisphere, criminalising poor Americans and all sorts of other good stuff.

Never mind that US financial institutions have for decades reaped profits from the international drug trade – or that “The CIA Drug Connection Is as Old as the Agency,” as an article on The New York Times website puts it.

It should come as no surprise by now that the president who campaigned on keeping the US out of wars and then promptly bombed Iran has now found another conflict in which to embroil the country. And as is par for the course in US imperial belligerence, the rationale for aggression against Venezuela doesn’t hold water.

For example, the Trump administration has strived to pin the blame for the fentanyl crisis in the US on Maduro. But there’s a slight problem – which is that Venezuela doesn’t even produce the synthetic opioid in question.

As NBC News and other hardly radical outlets have pointed out, Venezuelan drug cartels are focused on exporting cocaine to Europe, not fentanyl to the US.

Nevertheless, on November 13, US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth – pardon, US Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, as per administrative rebranding – took to X to assure his audience that the massive US military build-up off the Venezuelan coast is a mission that “defends our Homeland, removes narco-terrorists from our Hemisphere, and secures our Homeland from the drugs that are killing our people”.

This is the same administration, of course, that was just threatening to starve impoverished Americans by withholding essential food assistance, which suggests that the wellbeing of “our people” isn’t really of utmost concern.

Consider also the fact that Trump slashed federal funding for gun violence prevention programmes in a country where mass shootings have become a way of life. Obviously, massacres in elementary schools are “killing our people” in a way that has nothing whatsoever to do with Venezuela.

But it’s so much more fun to blame Maduro for everything, right?

Poverty itself is a major killer in America – as is the domestic pharmaceutical industry (speaking of opioids). However, none of these full-blown crises has merited a remotely gung-ho response from the valiant defenders of the Homeland.

Like his predecessor Hugo Chavez, Maduro has long been a thorn in the side of US empire – hence the current campaign to discredit him as a “narcoterrorist” and thereby set the stage for regime change. He also happens to be a pet target of Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is seen as the main architect of Washington’s war plans in Venezuela. Potentially eyeing a presidential bid in three years, Rubio is seeking to curry favour with his Florida constituency, which includes fanatically right-wing members of the Venezuelan and Cuban diasporas.

According to the Reuters report on impending “Venezuela-related operations”, two of the US officials consulted told the news agency that “the options under consideration included attempting to overthrow Maduro”. If the plans succeeds, Rubio would join the lengthy roster of US politicians who have propagated deadly havoc abroad in the interest of political gains at home.

Meanwhile, The Washington Post reported on Saturday that the White House had “proposed an idea for US military planes to drop leaflets over Caracas in a psychological operation” to pressure Maduro.

Sounds like a page – or a leaflet – out of the old Israeli military playbook.

And as the Trump administration barrels on with its not-so-covert plans for Venezuela, such hemispheric recklessness will secure neither the US homeland nor anyone else’s.

"The ""ShamWow guy"" is running for Congress and is looking to wipe the floor with the competition.

Offer Vince Shlomi, the once-prominent infomercial pitchman, is running for Congress in Texas, according to a filing with the state's Republican Party.

Shlomi is running for the seat held by Republican Rep. John Carter, 84, who has served more than two decades in Congress. Carter announced earlier this month he'd run for re-election, so Shlomi has an uphill battle against an entrenched incumbent.

The former pitchman, best known for his role selling the ""ShamWow"" towel, told Fox News that he wants to ""destroy wokeism"" in Congress and that he's been motivated by the ""political infighting in the country"" to run and ""make America happy.""

In 2009, Shlomi was arrested on suspicion of battery after a fight with a woman, who was also arrested. Prosecutors declined to press charges. Shlomi told NBC News in an interview for a 2013 article that he takes ""full responsibility"" for his actions and that he would cut down on partying.

“People understand you make mistakes in life,” he said. “Hopefully I won’t make another mistake.”

Shlomi’s candidacy is listed on the state party’s website, ahead of Taxas’ December filing deadline for candidates. But he hasn’t yet filed with the Federal Election Commission. The state's primary takes place in March.

"Milli Vanilli used to be Grammys poison… but not anymore

If you were asked to name the three lowest moments in the history of the Grammy Awards, you ... might have a tough time narrowing down a proper list. You might note the year the Grammys introduced a heavy metal category, rightfully nominated Metallica and then gave the award to Jethro Tull. Or the year Macklemore swept Kendrick Lamar in the hip-hop categories, prompting an outcry from pretty much everyone, including Macklemore himself. Or the year Tracy Chapman's ""Fast Car"" lost record of the year to Bobby McFerrin's ""Don't Worry, Be Happy,"" or … okay, let's move on. Grammy history is festooned with inexplicable snubs, embarrassments, blind spots and moments in which classics were passed over in favor of flashes in the pan.

Still, the Grammys have never absorbed a greater embarrassment than they experienced when news broke that the public-facing members of Milli Vanilli — winner of the Grammy for best new artist at the beginning of 1990 — didn't sing their own songs. Rob Pilatus and Fab Morvan, the photogenic performers who'd been the faces of Milli Vanilli, were actually lip-syncing the frothy pop songs that had made them famous. It was a significant scandal in the fall of 1990 — though, as is the case with so many scandals, the folks who experienced the most public shaming (Pilatus, Morvan, the Recording Academy) didn't exactly align with those most directly responsible (if you're looking for someone to blame, consider producer Frank Farian, or perhaps the rain). Milli Vanilli's Grammy was revoked and that was that.

The incident didn't just make the Grammys look bad, or throw kindling on the roaring rhetorical fire of those lamenting the fabricated nature of so much pop music. It also compelled them to be more cautious about honoring genres and subgenres widely viewed as lightweight. In the decades since, the Grammys have been slow to embrace boy bands, K-pop acts and other artists who face a credibility gap among Grammy voters, whose 21st century preferences have tended more toward legacy acts (Steely Dan, Herbie Hancock), flamboyant showmen (Jon Batiste, Bruno Mars), jazzy pop sophisticates (Norah Jones, Samara Joy) and contemporary rock stars (Beck, Foo Fighters).

When Harry Styles won album of the year in 2023 and said, ""This doesn't happen to people like me very often,"" he got roasted for it on social media. But people like Styles — not ""rich young good-looking white men"" so much as ""singers who came up in boy bands like One Direction"" — actually have often struggled to win Grammys, and are generally expected to pass through a sort of authenticity gauntlet (or at least demonstrate pop-cultural staying power) before getting accepted into the club. The Grammys have even tweaked their own eligibility requirements for the category of best new artist — it used to be far more stringent about newness than it is now — in part to allow acts more time to prove themselves.

Why does that unofficial authenticity gauntlet exist? At least one of the answers is that Milli Vanilli won best new artist in 1990. As much as the Grammys are known for making embarrassing mistakes — you know it's true — they're also known for overcorrecting in the years that follow. Metallica lost that metal Grammy for …And Justice for All in 1989, only to win an award for ""One"" (a song from the same record!) the following year, and then ""Stone Cold Crazy"" the year after that, and then the black album the year after that. Kendrick Lamar got shut out in that fateful Year of Macklemore (2014), only to win 22 Grammys and counting in the years since — including two in 2015 and five in 2016. After years of frustration in the general categories, Beyoncé's Cowboy Carter finally won album of the year in 2025, after decades of taking home awards primarily in genre-specific categories like R&B and pop.

The Grammys, for all their faults, do try to right their old wrongs. But the initial beneficiaries of their mistakes aren't always so lucky. Macklemore has never sniffed a Grammy nomination in the years since beating Lamar. In the case of Jethro Tull, that 1989 win corresponded with the veteran band's first — and, at least as of this writing, last — nomination.

Milli Vanilli's post-Grammy story has proven more complicated — and tragic. Pilatus and Morvan attempted a comeback as actual singers, released an ill-fated album as Rob & Fab in 1993 and even prepared a follow-up. But that record was shelved upon Pilatus' death in 1998. Morvan, however, has kept working — as a musician, a DJ and an author. Earlier this year, he released his memoir, You Know It's True: The Real Story of Milli Vanilli, which was accompanied by an audiobook read by Morvan himself.

On Nov. 7, 35 years after the Grammys forgot his number, Morvan was nominated in the category of best audio book, narration and storytelling recording. His competition includes Supreme Court Associate Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson and the Dalai Lama, who, had they thought ahead, really should have lip-synced each other's books, just to be rascals.

It's a twist few saw coming: a redemption story for a guy who helped bend the arc of Grammy history.

"The African Union declared 2025 to be the “Year of Justice for Africans and People of African Descent through Reparations”. The African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights has an opportunity to make that more than just a slogan, as it considers the current request for an advisory opinion before it, on states’ human rights obligations in the context of climate change. It has an opportunity to issue a landmark opinion affirming the link between colonialism and the harms of climate change to people(s) across the continent. Such an opinion would mark a major step forward from the International Court of Justice and in Africa’s fight for reparative justice.

On July 30, 2025, Amnesty International published a report recounting how, during the French colonial era in Madagascar, authorities deliberately unleashed harmful, genetically manipulated cochineal parasites across some 40,000 hectares (98,850 acres) of a drought-resilient vegetation in the Androy region in Madagascar’s deep South. Between 1924 and 1929, the parasites destroyed roughly 100km (62 miles) of vegetation cover each year.

This was not a minor ecological loss. The vegetation had sustained the Antandroy people for generations, providing food and helping to preserve groundwater through chronic droughts. Its destruction erased a vital natural defence system against those droughts. More than a century later, the destruction has left the Antandroy people exposed to recurring mass hunger, displacement, and death whenever drought strikes.

Furthermore, Madagascar’s droughts are being intensified by human-induced climate change, driven largely by high-income historically high emitting countries, such as France – the very colonial power that left the Antandroy people vulnerable.

When science leads and politics lags

The scientific link between colonialism and climate vulnerability has long been established. In 2022, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which advises the United Nations on the science related to climate change, highlighted not only how colonialism contributed to the climate crisis itself but also how its enduring harms have left many communities in former colonies more vulnerable to climate effects, such as droughts, floods, cyclones and rising sea levels.

Effective climate action needs more than science; it also requires political backing for states, particularly those with greater historic responsibility for climate change, to act on mitigation, adaptation and financing strategies. When this doesn’t happen, countries with minimal historical responsibility who are suffering the most from climate change have no option but to seek clarity and accountability through a world court, in this case, the International Court of Justice (ICJ). The ICJ has the capacity to influence political processes. The ICJ, in particular, can lend global legitimacy to scientific evidence. Indeed, the ICJ has considerable moral and persuasive authority, often shaping the behaviour of states on the international political stage.

The opportunity for the ICJ to exert this influence arrived when in March 2023 Vanuatu, itself a former colony of both France and the United Kingdom, rallied the UN General Assembly to request an ICJ advisory opinion on states’ legal obligations regarding climate change. Formerly colonised nations in Africa and elsewhere joined the effort, many explicitly highlighting how colonial harms and climate injustices are interconnected.

When the ICJ delivered its opinion in July 2025, there was a glaring omission. The word “colonialism” appeared nowhere in relation to climate change, neither in the main opinion nor in the 12 separate opinions and declarations issued by its judges. The ICJ also sidestepped a critical question: how far back in time can claims for climate obligations reach? This question is crucial, because former colonial powers often claim that colonialism was not prohibited under international law when it was practised and, therefore, no legal obligation to provide reparations exists. They also often defend their role in causing climate change by arguing that they were unaware of the harm and faced no legal limits on greenhouse gas emissions until recently.

Customary international law shatters the colonial defence

Despite its regrettable silence on the question of colonialism, the ICJ offered some reassurances to countries that are bearing the combined consequences of colonialism and climate change by affirming that states’ climate change obligations are not confined to climate treaties. They also flow from customary international law, which dictates that a state’s responsibility can extend into the present if a wrongful act continues to affect the enjoyment of human rights, regardless of when that act originally occurred.

Engaging customary international law is significant because it reshapes the question that any Court ought to ask about colonial climate legacies. In this context, the relevant question is not whether states can be held accountable for the intertwined impacts of colonialism and climate change. Nor is it how far back we should look to assign responsibility for greenhouse gas emissions, which linger in the atmosphere for centuries. The question is: are harms rooted in the colonial era, including those that shape climate vulnerability, causing human rights violations today?

The simple answer is yes. The greenhouse gases now heating our planet and fuelling a cascade of rights violations have been trapped in the atmosphere for generations. They are the direct legacy of the fossil fuel burning that powered the industrial rise of former colonial powers since the 1750s and their post World War I & II economic recovery. In Madagascar, the French colonial administration’s destruction of the drought-resilient vegetation that had long sustained the Antandroy people stripped them of their natural defence against recurring droughts. This forced them into dependence and cheap labour within the colonial cash-crop economy. All this helped expand the forging of Europe’s economic paths and markets, which were powered by the burning of fossil fuels, releasing unprecedented quantities of greenhouse gases, which caused climate change.

The ICJ’s half measure: Opening the door, then closing it

By affirming that customary international law can ground claims for climate-related reparations, the ICJ appeared to open the door for climate demands tied to colonial harms. Yet, in the same opinion, the ICJ reinforced one of the very arguments long used by those who benefited from colonialism to reject responsibility.

The ICJ stated that full reparation — through restitution, compensation or satisfaction — is possible only when a “sufficiently direct and certain causal link” can be proven between the wrongful act and the injury. But making such a definitive link between innumerable acts of colonial violence and the impacts they had in exacerbating climate-change vulnerability is nearly impossible.

The requirement of such a definitive link as a precondition for colonial reparations, without qualifying how it could practically work for colonialism and climate change impacts, provides cover to countries like France. In Madagascar’s case, for instance, the French government could easily argue: “It has been a century since the colonial destruction of drought-resistant vegetation, and factors like population growth have played a role and the act of greenhouse gas emissions and destruction of ecosystems was not regarded as a violation. How can France be held legally responsible and realistically be expected to quantify reparations today?” As UN experts have observed, “the greatest barrier to reparations for colonialism and slavery is that the principal beneficiaries of both lack the political will and moral courage to make them a reality.”

Will the African court echo the ICJ’s silence, or break it?

Since May 2025, the African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights has been reviewing a request for an advisory opinion on the human and peoples’ rights obligations of African states in the context of climate change. This is more than a procedural exercise. The request highlights the relationship between climate change and colonialism – a point that human rights actors intend to emphasise in their submissions before the court.

This is therefore a chance for the Court to articulate what the ICJ would not: that the fight for climate justice is inextricably linked with Africa’s fight for reparative justice. Such a stance would lay bare the plight of those still suffering the intersecting harms of colonialism and climate change such as the Antandroy. It would contribute to breathing life into the Year of Reparations and align with the African Commission’s 2022 Resolution on Africa’s Reparations Agenda, which provides the African Court a mechanism through which to push African states to pursue justice for the trade and trafficking of enslaved Africans, colonialism and colonial crimes, and racial segregation. The possibilities remain open. It may also encourage them to return to the ICJ to give the world court an opportunity to redeem itself.

"New poetry stresses that our stories are more precious and urgent than ever

NPR

Editor's Note: This review discusses suicide.

How can poetry help us now, when practically every morning brings a fresh assault on knowledge, wisdom and safety? Amid the cruel political discourse horrifying headlines that seem to envelop everything, where is there a place for poetry? What can a bunch of artfully arranged words do?

A lot, I'd argue.

Words are among the many things under attack. Our stories, the ways that we fill our words with our own meanings, are more precious and urgent than ever, as three new books this fall by poets in – or entering – mid-career make clear. They lay claim to stories of identity, suffering and hope, to a kind of collective subjectivity, to the inner life of a country in the throes of deep pain and uncertainty. Here's a look:

Blue Opening by Chet'la Sebree

Chet'la Sebree's third book begins with the thwarted wish to have a child: ""Many in my family have been plagued/ by menorrhagia in early middle age--/ fibrinous weeds causing their bodies to bleed streams,/ flooding lands no longer suitable for plants.""

What follows is a rapidly paced, heart-stricken coming to terms with a body and a future suddenly altered by autoimmune disease, with the meanings of motherhood and daughterhood, and with the stunned language required to describe it all when there is ""no one to know/ my body's vernacular, that it would mistake me for foreigner.""

Blindingly clear and unornamented, these poems have all their cards on the table, ""pregnant with grief—/ it's bloated, black, a matted thatch."" If the body is in revolt — ""I am not the owner of this vessel I thought I owned, implies the man trying to sell it to me"" — then it is through language that Sebree can lay claim to herself, to her story, and take it back.

The lexicons of motherhood and illness (""I accept this list of words:// necrotizing lymphadenitis and swell-scrambled nerves"") become a vocabulary of grief and profound disappointment with what may and may not be possible. Sebree searches for language to carry the grief and to promise some kind of hope and inner rebirth; she finds a surprising kind of peace and power ""when a centrifuge spins/ my blood 3,000 revolutions per minute/ to render me perhaps anew to me again."" A new kind of creation becomes possible, as well, through poetry.

The Seeds by Cecily Parks

With The Seeds, her third book, Cecily Parks comes into her full powers. These poems are dark, lavish, far-reaching and subtly layered, making a harsh and rich mirror of the pastoral and the domestic. Parks reckons with the compromises that every life demands, that motherhood and art demand, that a country where violence and cruelty are suddenly triumphant require: ""now I think of hope// as a swing chained to a branch./ it can be used until/ the branch sweeps the ground/ with a shush shush because/ it cannot bear/ so much weight and still loft through/ the dream-trafficked air.""

Parks' powers of description are breathtaking, not only because one feels transported but also because, as in the poems of Elizabeth Bishop, the emotion, the domestic or personal story, is interwoven into – always an undercurrent of, a reason for – the description. But somehow, the world as described also feels like the world, not a projection. In these poems, Parks feels with her eyes.

The writing is simply beautiful: ""the grackles plummet down to pierce the lawn/ for seeds and fat brown live oak acorns."" The words dart in and out of the rhythm like the grackles' dark beaks, making gentle animals of a mother and her ""ravenous daughters."" This book is a delight, a feast of grief and determined celebration. A fallen world this lovingly observed must be at least somewhat redeemed.

The New Economy by Gabrielle Calvocoressi

Hopelessness is a beloved enemy in these poems, a necessary muse. So are grief and fear. ""The days I don't want to kill myself/ are extraordinary,"" begins the most affirming poem about suicide I've ever read. But these are not merely affirming poems (though one of them is titled ""Affirmation Cistern When I Let Go of My Fear Life Becomes Magical""). Calvocoressi is at home in the dark, they live there, even if light is their element. They're wise because they're wary: ""every being will slaughter/ their neighbor if they're hungry,/ and enough.""

Sponsor Message

All of our violence, they assert – with a compassion so pure it feels out of step with the times – is born of fear: ""when I was little I wanted/ to be tough to beat people up to own a gun./ wanted the boy body that would keep my body/ from being so scared."" Violence begins in each of us, is always inflicted first upon ourselves. And yet, we persist, try to do better – we must.

A series of ""Miss You"" poems, high-energy elegies for loved ones who have died, celebrate life emphatically by not quite letting go of the past: ""miss you in your puffy blue jacket./ They're hip now. I can bring you a new one/ if only you'll come by. Know I told you /it was okay to go. Know I told you it was okay/ to leave me./ Why'd you believe me?"" Why let the past go? Where else do we live but our stories? Where else can we rest from the terrors of the present? Where else can we remind ourselves of the beauty of the world?

"20. Claws (2020)

Such was the extent of fan involvement in the How I’m Feeling Now album that the title of Claws was decided by online vote. The opposite of the album’s more fraught depictions of lockdown, it celebrates being trapped with someone you love, although the clanking rhythm track adds a vague sense of unease.

19. Taxi (2016)

According to one fan database, there are 260 unreleased Charli xcx tracks lurking around online. Taxi, from the scrapped album XCX World, remains the most celebrated for a reason: the funny, snotty saga of a midweek blind date gone wildly out of control, it’s a perfect example of Charli and producer Sophie’s skewed approach to pop.

18. Apple (2024)

View image in fullscreen Playing Glastonbury earlier this year. Photograph: Anthony Devlin/Hogan Media/Shutterstock

The poppiest track on Brat – nearly binned midway through recording sessions – Apple’s earworm bubblegum melody carries a lyric about strained parental relationships and intergenerational trauma. It also went on to both spawn a viral TikTok dance craze and earn a Grammy nomination. The remix, featuring the Japanese House, feels sweeter still – and equally fantastic.

17. New Shapes (ft Caroline Polachek and Christine and the Queens) (2021)

It’s easy to view Brat’s predecessor, Crash, as Charli xcx trying to fit in with standard ideas about mainstream pop, rather than forging her own distinctive path. But its highlights are pretty high: New Shapes deploys both Christine and the Queens and Caroline Polachek over a fierce take on 80s electro.

16. Roll With Me (2017)

View image in fullscreen Sophie (left) and Charli xcx on stage in 2016. Photograph: Daniel Boczarski/Redferns

There used to be a rule of thumb that Charli xcx perversely released her best tracks not on her albums but her mixtapes. Listening to Roll With Me, you can see how that idea blossomed: producer Sophie provides relentless kick-drum thwack and sparse, super-spiky electronics, while Charli brings fabulous attitude-laden pop smarts.

15. Nuclear Seasons (2011)

If you’re looking for early evidence that Charli xcx was different, then this track from her debut EP, later to become the opener for her debut album, is a good place to start. The lyrics mix up relationship trauma, post-apocalyptic imagery and the suggestion that pop culture is a state of decay; the music reboots doomy 80s synth pop. It’s also insanely catchy.

14. 360 (2024)

“I went my own way and I made it / I’m your favourite reference, baby … I don’t fucking care what you think”: 360 is both the sound of the Brat era swaggering (or perhaps staggering) into view and a superb pop song, whether you opt for the original or the Robyn and Yung Lean-assisted remix.

13. I Got It (2017)

The Pop 2 mixtape sounded like Charli xcx and her collaborators trying to will a more interesting, provocative pop landscape into being: on I Got It, extravagantly foul-mouthed rapper Cupcakke, Brazilian drag queen vocalist Pabllo Vittar and pansexual shape-shifting US singer Brooke Candy do their thing over a minimal, thrillingly futuristic musical backdrop.

12. House (2025)

However you might have expected Charli xcx to follow up Brat, it’s unlikely that you expected this, from the forthcoming soundtrack to Wuthering Heights: a warped electronic homage to the Velvet Underground, filled with drones, shards of noise and a guest appearance from John Cale, which bursts into furious distortion-laden industrial noise at its climax.

11. Club Classics (2024)

Pop has hardly wanted for songs about nightclubs, but few of them have captured the small hours dancefloor’s manic sense of euphoria like Club Classics. It feels chaotic, relentless and artificially accelerated, and celebrates complete abandon: “Sweat marks on all my clothes … I wanna be blinded by the lights.”

10. Gone (ft Christine and the Queens) (2019)

View image in fullscreen Christine and the Queens (left) and Charli xcx performing on The Tonight Show in 2019. Photograph: NBC/NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal/Getty Images

Another Christine and the Queens collaboration, Gone improbably transforms the lyrical topic of crushing social anxiety – “I feel so unstable / I fucking hate these people” – into anthemic pop. There’s a powerful sense of catharsis about the way it explodes from brooding verses into a banging, exhilarating chorus.

9. Backseat (ft Carly Rae Jepsen) (2017)

Charli xcx and Carly Rae Jepsen once drunkenly plotted to make an album together; their solitary IRL collaboration is marvellous. Thematically, Backseat feels like two different songs – one about a breakup, the other about the alienating nature of celebrity – perfectly joined by the chorus (“I’m alone”) and shifting, inventive electronic backing.

8. Boys (2017)

By latter-day xcx standards, Boys is musically and lyrically straightforward – a giddy reverie of lust set to a suitably daydreamy backing – but it’s utterly charming and joyful. Extra points for the video, which featured the lead singer of Vampire Weekend lurking among its parade of heavily muscled objects of desire.

7. Anthems (2020)

Written and recorded as Covid raged, its lyrics crowdsourced with fans online, Anthems perfectly captures those lockdown moments when the urge to, as Charli put it, “go out, blow off some steam, get fucked up” became overwhelming. If its sound is intense to the point of seeming a bit nuts, well, that’s how it felt.

6. Boom Clap (2014)

Originally intended for former Disney star Hilary Duff (she rejected it), the song’s author turned Boom Clap into the highlight of her second album, Sucker, and her first US Top 10 hit. No wonder: it’s hugely catchy and impressively classy, the hooky chorus set amid chugging, pulsing synths – though she hates it now.

5. Next Level Charli (2019)

A paean to her fans, packed with references to her past work, the brilliance of Next Level Charli lies in the gulf between the music, which lulls the listener into believing they’re going to get a dreamy, 80s-influenced ballad, and the gobby, playground-chant stridency of the vocal: “In the rave – go for ever and ever!”

4. Von Dutch (2024)

View image in fullscreen In Los Angeles, California, 2024. Photograph: Étienne Laurent/AFP/Getty Images

You could call Von Dutch a diss track – it’s rumoured to be aimed at FKA twigs – but it feels more like an infectious expression of self-confidence: someone who knows she has hit her imperial phase, and has created an irresistible, epochal pop single almost entirely out of grinding, revving noise to prove it.

3. Vroom Vroom (2015)

A step into the leftfield that got decidedly mixed reviews on release, Vroom Vroom now feels like the birth of Charli xcx 2.0, harnessing her songwriting skills to the skeletal, avant-pop sound of PC Music affiliate Sophie. A decade ago it felt completely removed from mainstream pop trends; today it sounds incredibly prescient.

2. Girl, So Confusing (2024)

A different class to the usual pop-star-writes-prickly-song-about-fellow-pop-star fare, Girl, So Confusing is both an amazing song and a heartwarming saga. The original version depicted a fraught relationship with Lorde, accompanied by a synthesiser that fizzes and growls; the remix featured Lorde herself answering the criticisms and movingly explaining her own issues.

1. Track 10 (2017)

On the face of it, Track 10, from her mixtape Pop 2, is an unlikely list-topper. It’s a remix of a demo – eventually reworked into the Lizzo-featuring 2019 single Blame It on Your Love – with what looks like a placeholder title. But it’s also a masterpiece: an epic ballad that’s both wildly experimental and genuinely affecting. The lyrics sound like a drunken confession from someone who can’t stop her insecurities destroying a relationship. Anyone else might have been inclined to play a song like that straight, but somehow, the overload of theoretically alienating electronics – glitches and distortion, wilfully excessive AutoTune, icy maximalist rave synths – only amplifies its impact.",figurative
"Trump’s breakup with some Republicans may entertain, but it won’t pull American politics out of the plutocratic bog.

In the latest episode of the soap opera that passes for politics in the United States, President Donald Trump has dramatically split with Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, a former ally and a notorious wearer of the MAGA hat.

Writing on his Truth Social platform on Friday, Trump denounced his fellow Republican as “wacky” and “Far Left”, claiming that he did not have time to deal with her alleged barrage of phone calls: “I can’t take a ranting Lunatic’s call every day.”

As The New York Times noted, Trump had previously “stood by” Greene when she was criticised “for voicing conspiracy theories about the Sept. 11 attacks, school shootings and wildfires started by space lasers”.

Anyway, nothing “Lunatic” about any of that.

Greene denies having called the president, saying instead that she had texted him to suggest that he cease endeavouring to thwart the full release of the so-called Epstein files pertaining to the late paedophile and disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, which may implicate Trump.

The US House of Representatives is set to vote this week on the matter – and Greene is not the only Republican to have broken ranks. Several other House Republicans have also defied Trump on the Epstein front, including Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Lauren Boebert of Colorado.

In a typical about-face, Trump has now spontaneously reversed his position on the Epstein files, posting on Truth Social late on Sunday: “House Republicans should vote to release the Epstein files, because we have nothing to hide.”

And yet the Epstein files are hardly the only issue that raises the question of whether MAGA might not be headed for some sort of self-combustion.

As Trump recently reminded Americans, “Don’t forget, MAGA was my idea. MAGA was nobody else’s idea.”

And so it’s only logical that folks would associate the distinct failure to “make America great again” with the idea man himself.

Outright propaganda can only go so far – and people tend to notice when they don’t have enough money to put food on the table in spite of upbeat presidential pronouncements regarding the state of the economy.

Even Trump has apparently realised, to some extent, that he stands to further alienate his base by insisting on nonsensical tariffs and other punitive financial measures. As a nonsolution, the government will now lower tariffs on coffee and bananas while the president muses over potential $2,000 tariff rebate cheques and 50-year mortgages.

A November 14 White House news release blamed the Democrats for the country’s “economic mess” but assured citizens that “grocery prices and housing prices are trending in the right direction” with prices “for everyday staples” such as ice cream seeing “declines”.

The news release ended on the inspiring note: “We’re making progress – and the best is yet to come.”

In addition to the cost-of-living crisis, another source of rising discontent among Republicans is US support for Israel. In July, Greene became the first Republican lawmaker to call the genocide in the Gaza Strip by name, condemning the “starvation” of Palestinians.

To be sure, US aid to Israel is not just a Republican thing; Trump’s Democratic predecessor Joe Biden was more than happy to fling tens of billions of dollars at the genocidal state as it went about starving and otherwise annihilating civilians in Gaza.

The Trump administration, however, has added a slight twist to business as usual by not only backing Israel to the hilt but also simultaneously threatening to starve poor Americans at home by withholding essential food assistance.

But, hey, at least the price of ice cream is “declining”.

Last week, two days before his official breakup with Greene, Trump took to Truth Social to warn that “only a very bad, or stupid Republican would fall into” the Democratic “trap” of the “Jeffrey Epstein Hoax”, allegedly concocted purely to detract attention from the Democrats’ wide-ranging transgressions.

But it seems that an ever-greater number of MAGA adherents may be at risk of descending into badness and stupidity as Trump reveals himself to be maybe not the most qualified person to “drain the swamp in Washington, DC” – one of the president’s perennial promises to do away with corruption and other traditional political vices.

Advertisement

Indeed, Trump’s apoplectic fits over the possible release of details regarding Epstein – ie, someone who was very much entrenched in said “swamp” – do not bode well in terms of drainage prospects.

Then again, the fact that Americans re-elected a nepotistic billionaire and convicted criminal to head the country suggests that the swamp probably isn’t going anywhere anytime soon.

On a micro level, the intra-MAGA soap opera may provide some fleeting gratification for spectators. But it’s not like the drama sets the stage for any substantive improvement to the political panorama.

And while opposing Trump is, objectively speaking, a noble aim, we don’t really need any more people who think space lasers cause wildfires and compare pandemic safety measures to the Holocaust. Nor, for that matter, do we need any more genocide-enabling Democrats, who at the end of the day are just as committed as Republicans to maintaining a corrupt plutocracy.

Blind and unquestioning support for the president may be eroding among his MAGA base. But rest assured that the swamp is here to stay.

"Shopping early Black Friday sales is no longer a suggestion — it’s a must. I’ve been talking to trend forecasters, supply chain managers, economists and consumer behavior specialists for weeks, and they have one main piece of advice for shoppers: hurry. Experts say items will likely go out of stock quickly this year due to limited inventory, and while prices may not drop as low as usual due to tariffs, there’s plenty of worthwhile discounts out there. The sooner you shop, the more options you’ll get to browse through, and the longer you'll have to compare prices across retailers, weigh shipping options and hunt for coupons.

This is my sixth year covering Black Friday for NBC Select, so I know how to find deals that are actually worth buying. I spent weeks combing through thousands of discounts to find the best early Black Friday deals— each one I recommend below is highly rated and 20% off or more. When possible, I ran deals through price trackers to make sure they’re at their lowest price in at least three months or the lowest price ever. I’ll frequently update this list leading up to Black Friday.

“I use this gel moisturizer on nights when my face is feeling particularly dry and I wake up the next day with soft, hydrated skin,” says NBC Select editorial projects manager Rebecca Rodriguez. “The thick jelly texture means a little goes a long way, so I spread a thin layer across my face and can still feel it in the morning.” The cream is made with collagen to firm and plumpen skin, as well as moisturizing ingredients like niacinamide, squalane and hyaluronic acid.

Kids can use them to make 3D and 2D structures.

Yeti drinkware is a popular gift in my family, and I’ve personally received this tumbler because my loved ones know how often I take my iced coffee and smoothies on the go. The 42-ounce, dishwasher-safe cup is made from stainless steel and has double-wall vacuum insulation, which helps keep drinks hot or cold for hours, in my experience. The large handle makes the tumbler easy to hold, its base is cup holder-compatible and it comes with a straw lid that you can take apart for easy cleaning. I also appreciate that the exterior of the cup doesn’t produce condensation, so whatever surface I put it on stays dry.

4.9-star average rating from 1,237 reviews at Calpak

“I bring almost my entire bathroom with me while traveling, and this cosmetic case is one of the only ones that can handle my excess of products,” says Rodriguez. “When I first used it, I was dumbfounded by how much of my makeup and skin care fit inside. It also feels luxe with its faux-leather exterior and gold zippers.” Since the cosmetics case is clear, you can always see what’s inside and easily wipe it down to clean as needed. It also comes in tiny, small and large sizes, all of which are on sale.

4.4-star average rating from 17 reviews at Hanna Andersson

I like to think of myself as somewhat of a pajama set connoisseur, and out of all the options I own, Hanna Andersson’s are my all-time favorite. I’ve bought them for adults and kids in my life, especially if I’m struggling with a gift idea, and there are lots of options if you’re looking for matching holiday pajamas the whole family can wear. This set is made from lightweight, buttery soft, moisture-wicking fabric and the top and bottoms both have a relaxed fit with piping detail. They fit true to size, in my experience.

United States President Donald Trump and China’s Xi Jinping held a wide-ranging phone call on issues like Taiwan and trade, as relations appeared to gather new momentum since the pair’s meeting in South Korea last month.

Hours after the call on Monday, the US president hailed the two countries’ “extremely strong” relationship, announcing that he and Xi discussed the war in Ukraine, fentanyl trafficking and a deal for farmers during the “very good” morning call, which also included an exchange of invitations to each other’s countries.

“Now we can set our sights on the big picture … We agreed that it is important that we communicate often, which I look forward to doing,” said Trump, who said he had accepted an invitation to visit China in April, with President Xi making the journey to the US later in the year.

Trump made no mention of any discussions on Taiwan. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs had earlier reported that Xi told Trump the return of the island to China was an “integral part of the post-war international order” forged in the joint US-China fight against “fascism and militarism”.

Xi’s overtures came as his country faced off against Japan over the future of the self-governing island, which China considers its territory. Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi recently said Japan’s military could intervene militarily in any attack on Taiwan.

According to China’s Foreign Ministry, Trump told Xi that the US, which does not officially recognise Taiwan’s claim to statehood, yet remains the island’s most important partner and arms supplier, “understands how important the Taiwan question is to China”.

The phone call also coincided with the Trump administration’s latest push to end the war in Ukraine. China has positioned itself as a neutral party in the conflict. In Monday’s call, Xi said he supported “all efforts that are conducive to peace”, expressing hope that the crisis be resolved “at its root”, according to the Foreign Ministry.

The conversation came nearly one month after the two men met in person in the South Korean city of Busan as a trade war between the two countries rocked international markets.

A tentative deal reached in October’s meeting saw Beijing agree to suspend export restrictions on critical minerals for one year.

Washington said it would cut back tariffs on Chinese products and that Beijing would up purchases of soya beans from US farmers after shunning the product for months.

Trump said on Monday that he had spoken about “Fentanyl, Soybeans and other Farm Products” with his Chinese counterpart.

“We have done a good, and very important, deal for our Great Farmers – and it will only get better,” Trump wrote, without providing further details.",literal
"This year’s UN climate talks in Brazil’s Belém ended without a major breakthrough. The text of the final agreement lacked a deal to shift away from fossil fuels, delayed crucial finance and the “mutirão” decision contained no roadmap to halt and reverse deforestation. But the multilateral system at Cop30 held together at a point when its collapse felt close. This ought to be a warning: next year’s conference of the parties must strike a better bargain between the rich and poor world.

Developing countries are far from united on some issues. Over rare earth minerals China sees any move as targeting its dominance, while Africa sees it as essential for governance. Elsewhere petrostates did not support Colombia’s call for a fossil fuel phase-out. Yet the global south broadly coheres around a simple principle: its nations must be equipped to survive a climate emergency they did not create. That means cash to build flood defences, make agricultural systems resilient, protect coastlines and rebuild after disasters strike. They also demand front-loaded finance to transition to clean, green economic growth.

But climate finance is a hard sell in the global north. Rightwing populists in the west rail against cash being spent on climate and foreigners. Any issue that fuses the two becomes a difficult political terrain. Then there is the broader geopolitics – one in which spiky confrontations have become the norm. For parts of the rich world, clean industrialisation of the global south isn’t a priority – it’s an economic threat.

Donald Trump did not send a team to Brazil, the first time since 1995 America was not officially represented at the annual climate summit. This may not have been entirely unwelcome. The US, which owes the largest climate debt in the world, has blocked meaningful finance deals for years – and its reshoring agenda is designed to keep key industries at home. This is not entirely without logic: some analysts say China is the proof that the west has reason to fear too rapidly empowering poorer nations.

But such a narrow worldview will only hinder progress. As Evans Njewa, chair of the Least Developed Countries (LDC) group, stated bluntly after Cop30 ended, Belém was missing ambition. For him the world’s most vulnerable countries came seeking protection; they left with promises postponed. Yet the disappointment felt today is a spur for greater action tomorrow. The LDCs are looking to Cop31 in Turkey and, ultimately, to Cop32 in Ethiopia to change minds.

This year’s UN adaptation report could not be clearer: the scale of the task ahead is vast. Developing countries, it suggests, require more than $310bn per year by 2035 – yet they received only $26bn in 2023, down from $28bn the year before. Needs are rising faster than finance. The UN warns that without a dramatic course-correction the poorest countries will be left exposed to heatwaves, wildfires and floods.

The urgency of the crisis explains why African negotiators are so insistent that adaptation finance must be from the state, preferably in grant form. To imagine otherwise, they say, is delusional; currently private finance makes up only 5% of adaptation cash and most of that is philanthropic. Private capital will not build sea walls, restore mangroves or protect subsistence farmers. Cop30 underscored a simple reality: only by moving beyond symbolism and self-interest can the world secure its future.",literal
"What we can learn about Kurt Cobain, Freddie Mercury and Beyoncé from their denim

toggle caption Loaned by Tom Coyne/David Fenton for Levi’s/Levi Strauss & Co.

Pop music is full of references to denim — from the opening lyrics of Elton John's ""Tiny Dancer"" — ""Blue jean baby"" — to Flo Rida's ode to an Apple Bottoms pair in ""Low.""

But musicians don't just sing about jeans. They also live in them. And those garments sometimes reveal intriguing details about the people who wear them, as the new Amped: Music Icons in Levi's Denim exhibition at Levi's headquarters in San Francisco shows.

One of the exhibition's marquee items is a pair of Levi's 501s once owned by Kurt Cobain. The late Nirvana frontman's jeans set a Guinness World Record in 2023 when they sold for more than $412,750 at a Nashville auction.

Tracey Panek was there. ""I was bidding on it,"" Levi's in-house historian and archivist told NPR. ""But sadly one of my rivals got it.""

The winning bidder, private collector Tom Coyne, agreed to loan the jeans to Levi's for the exhibition. Cobain wore them on many occasions during the 1990s, including on the video for ""Heart-Shaped Box."" They show a lot of wear. There are heavy stains, rips and patches, including a colorful psychedelic print lining the hem.

""They're just a signature grunge-looking pair of jeans,"" Panek said.

The pants also tell more subtle stories.

Panek points to faded, upside-down lettering on the right leg — a four-letter word beginning with F — scribbled on a patch. While the artist was famously a left-handed guitarist, Panek said the scrawl suggests Cobain was actually ambidextrous. ""You can tell he was writing with his right hand while he was seated,"" she said.

Other pieces in the exhibition offer very different portraits of their famous owners.

The sharp creases in a pair of slim-fitting, light blue jeans once owned by Freddie Mercury say something about the Queen vocalist's fastidiousness. ""I think he ironed these,"" Panek said.

Meanwhile a rhinestone-festooned, western-style denim pants and matching jacket worn by Beyoncé in a recent Levi's advertising campaign highlight Queen Bey's penchant as a performer for upending traditional white, male tropes. ""She challenges a pool shark to a shootout,"" said Panek, describing one of the ads set to Beyoncé's 2024 song ""Levii's Jeans."" ""Of course, she wins hands down, and demands that her rival give up his Levi's.""

Mary Davis, a fashion historian and musicologist at Yale University, said musicians use denim in many different ways to construct identity and share messages.

""There's a way in which you can see denim being almost a blank canvas for anything that anybody wants to make it,"" Davis said.

Davis points to Bruce Springsteen's 1984 album Born in the U.S.A., with its songs about the struggles of the working class – and its memorable album cover. It shows Springsteen from behind in worn blue Levi's, a white T-shirt and a red baseball cap stuffed into a back pocket.

Davis said the photograph draws a potent line between denim's 19th century workwear roots and the troubadour of late twentieth century labor. ""He's making a statement there,"" Davis said.

"Opinion: Remembering Ted Clark, great colleague — better friend

toggle caption Doby Photography/NPR

Ted Clark grew up around the world, as the child of a US diplomat, living in Holland, Morrocco, and South Africa. His steadiness, fairness, and decency often made me think when he was NPR's Diplomatic Correspondent that Ted could show some members of the foreign service what real diplomacy sounds like. Ted Clark died last week, at the age of 79.

Ted came to NPR in its scrappy, early years, produced All Things Considered, then covered the White House and State Department before helping lead the International Desk. Longtime correspondent Sylvia Poggioli said he was, ""a masterful editor, gentle, patient soul, and steely defender of reporters against bureaucratic managers.""

Editor Martha Wexler called Ted ""the gentlest soul at NPR, who nurtured reporters and helped them do their very best work."" Reporter and editor Brenda Wilson said, ""He had a way of accommodating those who didn't fit the mold of whatever establishment where he landed.""

Julie McCarthy, who covered so much of the world for NPR, recalled Ted Clark as ""that rare creature who combined collaboration, kindness, and a steely determination to get it right — with a dollop of poetry thrown in.""

Ted and I came to NPR at about the same time, but I didn't know this story until this week:

Producer Neenah Ellis and Ted went to Mozambique in 1990 to report on children who had been separated from their families during the civil war.

""Ted interviewed children,"" Neenah told us. ""He was so good at that. We met a 10-year-old boy named Manicu Vashku. He was so small and quiet and wide eyed and sweet. Ted took to him immediately. The story Ted wrote about our trip was spare and matter of fact and kept returning to the children: how silent they were, how confused they seemed, how obedient they were.""

Their story, by the way, would win a Peabody Award.

Ted and Neenah joined workers from Save the Children as they brought Manicu to his aunt, in a village shattered by war.

""When it was time to leave, Ted gave Manicu notebooks and pens and told him to study hard.""

""I'm so glad I got to go there with Ted,"" Neenah Ellis told us. ""He always had a reverence about him."" Ted Clark was that exceptional journalist — and that rare soul — who always tried to find ways to help.",literal
"Reports say doctors diagnosed the woman with critically low blood sugar, likely leading to her weakened condition.

A woman in Thailand has shocked staff at a Buddhist temple when she started moving in her coffin after being brought in for cremation.

Wat Rat Prakhong Tham, a temple in the province of Nonthaburi on the outskirts of the capital, Bangkok, posted a video on its Facebook page, showing a woman lying in a white coffin in the back of a pick-up truck, slightly moving her arms and head, leaving temple staff bewildered.

Pairat Soodthoop, the temple’s general and financial affairs manager, told The Associated Press news agency on Monday that the 65-year-old woman’s brother drove her from the province of Phitsanulok to be cremated.

He said they heard a faint knock coming from the coffin.

“I was a bit surprised, so I asked them to open the coffin, and everyone was startled,” he said.

“I saw her opening her eyes slightly and knocking on the side of the coffin. She must have been knocking for quite some time.”

According to Pairat, the brother said his sister had been bedridden for about two years, when her health deteriorated and she became unresponsive, appearing to stop breathing two days ago.

The brother then placed her in a coffin and made the 500km (300-mile) journey to a hospital in Bangkok, to which the woman had previously expressed a wish to donate her organs.

The hospital refused to accept the brother’s offer as he didn’t have an official death certificate, Pairat said. His temple offers a free cremation service, which is why the brother approached them on Sunday, but was also refused due to the missing document.

The temple manager said that he was explaining to the brother how he could get a death certificate when they heard the knocking. They then assessed her and sent her to a nearby hospital.

The abbot said the temple would cover her medical expenses, according to Pairat.

According to the Thailand News website, doctors later diagnosed the woman with severe hypoglycaemia, or critically low blood sugar, and confirmed she had not experienced cardiac or respiratory failure.",literal
"Opinion: Susan Stamberg, trailblazer and NPR Founding Mother, retires

Susan Stamberg once began an interview with an orchestra conductor by asking a question she confessed she'd always wanted to ask someone in his line of work: ""Don't your arms get tired?""

Maestro Jorge Mester of the Louisville Orchestra told her, ""You know it's the most obvious question and never gets asked."" He said his right arm was a little heavy, but added that only unemployed conductors' arms get tired. His stayed in good condition.

Listening to Susan Stamberg reminded us that often the best questions are short, simple, and open-minded. She has been the master of that art.

This week, Susan Stamberg is putting down her microphone after more than 50 years at NPR. She has won shelves of major awards in broadcasting, and has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame — especially extraordinary for someone who became a star on the radio and not on a screen.

And many of us at NPR feel that we are here today because of Susan Stamberg.

She gave personality to a fledgling network that was almost an afterthought in the Public Broadcasting Act.

News voices in the 1970s tended to be somber, accent-less, and almost exclusively male. Susan Stamberg became the first woman ever to anchor a daily national evening news broadcast in the U.S., when she began to co-host All Things Considered in 1972. She was serious as the news required. But she was also curious, relentless, and utterly delightful.

Susan's voice made Americans say: ""They sound different, don't they?"" Her voice has been sharp, sometimes saucy, and could be silken — then let out a bell-ringing laugh.

She turned, ""What is NPR?"" into ""Have you heard NPR?""

Today, there are women at all ranks and responsibilities in what we now call ""media,"" working as correspondents, anchors, news directors, CEOs and more.

Susan Stamberg retires this week, but the sound and work of the place she helped found continues in all who have followed her voice to NPR. Susan has lifted us up for 50 years; and her arms have not grown tired.",figurative
"Islamabad balances alliances, economic needs and public sentiment as it weighs potential troop deployment to Gaza.

Islamabad, Pakistan – When the United Nations Security Council on Monday adopted a United States-authored resolution that paves the way for a transitional administration and an International Stabilisation Force (ISF) in Gaza, Pakistan – which was presiding over the council – had a seemingly contradictory response.

Asim Iftikhar Ahmed, Pakistan’s permanent representative to the UN, thanked the US for tabling the resolution and voted in its favour. But he also said Pakistan was not entirely satisfied with the outcome, and warned that “some critical suggestions” from Pakistan were not included in the final text.

Though the resolution promises a “credible pathway” to Palestinian statehood, Ahmed, in his comments to the council, said it did not spell that path out, and did not clarify the role of the UN, a proposed Board of Peace (BoP) to oversee Gaza’s governance, or the mandate of the ISF.

“Those are all crucial aspects with a bearing on the success of this endeavour. We earnestly hope that further details in coming weeks will provide the much-needed clarity on these issues,” he said.

But the country had already endorsed US President Donald Trump’s 20-point Gaza ceasefire plan in September – the basis for the UN resolution. And while several other Arab and Muslim countries have also cautiously supported the resolution, Pakistan, with the largest army among them, is widely expected to play a key role in the ISF.

The vote in favour of the resolution, coupled with the suggestions that Pakistan still has questions it needs answers to, represents a careful tightrope walk that Islamabad will need to navigate as it faces questions at home over possible military deployment in Gaza, say analysts.

“The US playbook is clear and has a pro-Israel tilt. Yet, we need to recognise that this is the best option that we have,” Salman Bashir, former Pakistani foreign secretary, told Al Jazeera. “After the sufferings inflicted on the people of Gaza, we did not have any option but to go along.”

Pakistan’s rising geopolitical value

In recent weeks, Pakistan’s top leaders have engaged in hectic diplomacy with key Middle Eastern partners.

Last weekend, Jordan’s King Abdullah II visited Islamabad and met Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Field Marshal Asim Munir, the army chief. Munir had earlier travelled to Amman in October, as well as to Cairo in Egypt.

Pakistan has traditionally had close relations with Gulf states, and those ties have tightened amid Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza. Pakistan has long called for “Palestinian self-determination and the establishment of a sovereign, independent and contiguous State of Palestine based on pre-1967 borders with al-Quds al-Sharif [Jerusalem] as its capital”.

But in recent weeks, Pakistan – the only Muslim nation with nuclear weapons – has also emerged as a key actor in the region’s security calculations, courted by both the United States and important Arab allies.

In September, Pakistan signed a Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement (SMDA) with Saudi Arabia, days after Israel had struck Doha, the Qatari capital. Then, in October, Prime Minister Sharif and Field Marshal Munir joined Trump and a bevy of other world leaders in Egypt’s Sharm el-Sheikh for the formal signing ceremony of the Gaza ceasefire agreement. Sharif lavished Trump with praise on the occasion.

By then, Trump had already described Munir as his “favourite field marshal”. Following a brief escalation with India in May, during which Pakistan said it shot down Indian jets, Munir met Trump in the Oval Office in June, an unprecedented visit for a serving Pakistani military chief who is not head of state.

In late September, Munir visited Washington again, this time with Sharif. The prime minister and army chief met Trump and promoted potential investment opportunities, including Pakistan’s rare earth minerals.

Now, Pakistan’s government is mulling its participation in the ISF. Though the government has not made any decision, senior officials have publicly commented favourably about the idea. “If Pakistan has to participate in it, then I think it will be a matter of pride for us,” Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on October 28. “We will be proud to do it.”

That’s easier said than done, cautioned some analysts.

Palestine is an emotive issue in Pakistan, which does not recognise Israel. The national passport explicitly states it cannot be used for travel to Israel, and any suggestion of military cooperation with Israeli forces – or even de facto recognition of Israel – remains politically fraught.

That makes the prospect of troop deployment to Gaza a highly sensitive subject for politicians and the military alike.

Government keeps cards close to chest

Officially, the government has been opaque about its position on joining the ISF.

Even while describing any participation in the force as a cause for pride, Defence Minister Asif said the government would consult parliament and other institutions before making any decision.

“The government will take a decision after going through the process, and I don’t want to preempt anything,” he said.

In a weekly press briefing earlier this month, Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said the question of Pakistan’s contribution would be decided “after consultation at the highest level”.

“The decision will be taken in due course, as and when required. Certain level of leadership has stated that the decision will be taken with the advice of the government,” he said.

Al Jazeera reached out to Asif, the defence minister, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, and the military’s media wing, the Inter-Services Public Relations, but received no response.

Legal, operational ambiguities

Some retired senior officers say Pakistan will not decide the matter behind closed doors.

Muhammad Saeed, a three-star general who served as Chief of General Staff until his 2023 retirement, said he expects the terms of reference and rules of engagement for any ISF deployment to be debated in public forums, including Pakistan’s National Security Council and parliament.

“This is such a sensitive topic; it has to be debated publicly, and no government can possibly keep it under wraps. So once the ISF structure becomes clear, I am certain that Pakistani decision-making will be very inclusive and the public will know about the details,” he told Al Jazeera.

Kamran Bokhari, senior director at the New Lines Institute for Strategy and Policy in Washington, DC, said the mutual defence agreement with Saudi Arabia meant that Pakistani troops in Gaza would likely be representing both countries. He, however, added that Pakistan would likely have participated in the ISF even without the Saudi pact.

Still, the lack of details about the ISF and Gaza’s governance in the UN resolution remains a stumbling block, say experts.

Several countries on the council said the resolution left key elements ambiguous, including the composition, structure and terms of reference for both the BoP and the ISF. China, which abstained, also described the text as “vague and unclear” on critical elements.

The resolution asks for the Gaza Strip to be “demilitarised” and for the “permanent decommissioning of weapons from non-state armed groups”, a demand that Hamas has rejected.

Hamas said the resolution failed to meet Palestinian rights and sought to impose an international trusteeship on Gaza that Palestinians and resistance factions oppose.

So far, the US has sent nearly 200 personnel, including a general, to establish a Civil-Military Coordination Center (CMCC) near Gaza on Israeli territory. The centre will monitor humanitarian aid and act as a base from which the ISF is expected to operate.

US-based media outlet Politico reported last month that Pakistan, Azerbaijan and Indonesia – all Muslim-majority states – were among the top contenders to supply troops for the ISF.

Meanwhile, the United Arab Emirates, which joined the Abraham Accords in 2020 and recognised Israel in Trump’s first tenure, has said it will not participate until there is clarity on the legal framework.

King Abdullah of Jordan also warned that without a clear mandate for the ISF, it would be difficult to make the plan succeed.

Costs, incentives and Pakistan’s historical role

Bokhari argued Pakistan has limited options, adding that many of its close allies are “deeply committed” to the initiative and have sought Islamabad’s participation.

“Pakistan’s economic and financial problems mean it will need to reciprocate militarily in order to secure” the goodwill of the US and Islamabad’s Gulf allies, he said. “We have to assume that the current civilian-military leadership is aware of the domestic political risks.”

Others point to Pakistan’s long experience with UN peacekeeping. As of September 2025, UN figures show Pakistan has contributed more than 2,600 personnel to UN missions, just below Indonesia’s 2,700, ranking Pakistan sixth overall.

Qamar Cheema, executive director of the Islamabad-based Sanober Institute, said Pakistan has emerged as a security stabiliser for the Middle East and has “extensive experience of providing support in conflict zones in the past”.

Pakistan currently faces security challenges on both its borders – with India to its east and Taliban-ruled Afghanistan to the west. But it “may not have to cut troops from its eastern or western borders, since the number of troops [needed in Gaza] may not be that big, as various countries are also sending troops,” Cheema told Al Jazeera.

Saeed, the retired general, said Pakistan’s historic position on Palestine remained intact and that its prior peacekeeping experience meant that its troops were well-equipped to help the ISF.

“Pakistan has one of the richest experiences when it comes to both peacekeeping and peace enforcement through the UN. We have a sizeable force, with a variety of experience in maintaining peace and order,” he said.

“The hope is that we can perhaps provide help that can eliminate the violence, lead to peace, bring humanitarian aid in Gaza and implement the UN resolution,” the former general said.

Domestic political risks and the Israeli factor

Despite those arguments, many in Pakistan question the feasibility – and political acceptability – of serving alongside or coordinating with Israeli forces.

Bashir, the former foreign secretary, acknowledged the risks and said the demand that Hamas deweaponise made the ISF “a difficult mission”.

Still, he said, “realism demands that we go along with a less than perfect solution”.

Bokhari of New Lines Institute said stakeholders often sort out details “on the go” in the early stages of such missions.

“Of course, there is no way Pakistan or any other participating nation can avoid coordinating with Israel,” he said.

Saeed, however, disagreed. He said ISF would likely be a coalition in which one partner coordinates any dealings with Israeli forces, meaning Pakistani troops might not have direct contact with Israel.

“There are other countries potentially part of ISF who have relations with Israel. It is likely they will take the commanding role in ISF, and thus they will be the ones to engage with them, and not Pakistan,” he said. He added Pakistan’s involvement – if it happens – would be narrowly focused on maintaining the ceasefire and protecting Palestinian lives.

But Omar Mahmood Hayat, another retired three-star general, warned that any operational tie to Israel “will ignite domestic backlash and erode public trust”.

Hayat said Pakistan has no diplomatic ties with Israel “for principled reasons” and that blurring that line, even citing humanitarian considerations, would invite domestic confusion and controversy.

“This is not just a moral dilemma, but it is also a strategic contradiction,” he said. “It weakens our diplomatic posture.”",figurative
"As COP30 negotiations in Belem enter their final stretch, there is hope that countries might finally agree on a roadmap to phase out fossil fuels — a breakthrough that is crucial if we are serious about keeping 1.5C alive. Yet even at this pivotal moment, one major highway is still missing from that roadmap that could undermine the progress made in Brazil: the carbon emissions of the military.

Under the Paris Agreement, governments are not required to report their militaries’ emissions, and most simply don’t. Recent analysis by the Military Emissions Gap project shows that what little data exists is patchy, inconsistent or missing entirely. This “military emissions gap” is the gulf between what governments disclose and the true scale of military pollution. The result is stark: militaries remain largely invisible in the Belem negotiations, creating a dangerous blind spot in global climate action.

The size of that blind spot is staggering. Militaries account for an estimated 5.5 percent of global emissions. This share is set to rise further as defence spending surges while the rest of society decarbonises. If militaries were a country, they would be the fifth-largest emitter on Earth, ahead of Russia with 5 percent. Yet only five countries follow the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change’s (UNFCCC) voluntary reporting guidelines for military emissions, and those cover fuel use alone. The reality is far broader: munitions production and disposal, waste management and fugitive emissions from refrigeration, air-conditioning, radar and electrical equipment are left out. And operations in international waters and airspace are not reported at all, leaving massive gaps in both climate accountability and action.

The military emissions gap widens further still when we consider the climate impact of armed conflicts. As if the horror and human suffering from fighting wars were not enough, wars also destroy ecosystems, leave a toxic legacy on lands for decades to follow, and result in significant CO2 emissions, including from the rebuilding following the destruction of buildings and infrastructure. But without any internationally agreed framework to measure conflict emissions, these additional emissions risk going unreported, meaning that we don’t know how much wars are setting back climate action.

But despite this, momentum for accountability is finally building. Nearly 100 organisations have signed the War on Climate initiative’s pledges ahead of COP30, and protesters and civil society groups in Belem are demanding the UNFCCC confront this long-ignored source of pollution. Policymakers are starting to shift, too. The European Union has taken steps towards more transparent reporting and decarbonisation in the defence sector, though this progress is now threatened by rapid rearmament. Combined with NATO’s new target for members to spend 5 percent of gross domestic product on militaries, these pledges could produce up to 200 million tonnes of CO2 and trigger as much as $298bn in climate damages annually, putting Europe’s own climate goals at risk.

International law reinforces the urgency and demand for accountability. The International Court of Justice’s recent landmark advisory opinion reminded states that they are obliged under climate treaties to assess, report and mitigate harms, including those caused by armed conflict and military activity. Ignoring these emissions doesn’t just undercount global warming; it masks the scale of the crisis and weakens the world’s ability to tackle its root causes.

The gap between current emission-reduction plans and what is needed to stay below the 1.5C limit remains catastrophic. If COP30 negotiators agree on a roadmap for phasing out fossil fuels, what happens next will determine whether it delivers real progress or remains symbolic. No sector can be exempt from climate action, and military emissions cannot continue to remain hidden.

Mandatory reporting of all military emissions to the UNFCCC – from combat and training activities to the long-lasting climate damage inflicted on communities – is essential. That data must form the baseline for urgent, science-aligned reductions, embedded in national climate plans, and consistent with the 1.5C limit.

"Two Black women said they were denied immediate medical attention despite being minutes away from giving birth.

The incidents, which happened days apart in different states, highlight long-standing disparities in health outcomes for Black women, health experts say.

In a TikTok video that has gone viral, Texas resident Karrie Jones can be seen screaming while a nurse at Dallas Regional Medical Center in Mesquite asks a series of intake questions, including her due date.

“Right now,” Jones yells as she writhes in pain in a wheelchair.

Jones’ mother, who took the video on Nov. 11, can be heard asking the nurse whether she treats all patients in the same manner “or just the Black ones.” The nurse does not respond.

In another video posted online, her mother says she asked hospital staff members whether they could move Jones into labor and delivery, as she was in visible distress. “She said no, I have to fill out all this paperwork.”

Jones' family say they waited more than half an hour before she was admitted. Jones’ mother declined to comment at this time.

'It's hurtful'

Less than a week later in Crown Point, Indiana, Mercedes Wells rushed to Franciscan Hospital when her contractions were 10 minutes apart, she told NBC News.

Familiar with labor pains as a mother with three kids waiting at home in Illinois, Wells knew the contractions meant her fourth baby could arrive soon.

After six hours and a checkup from the nurse, Wells said, she was sent home without ever having seen a doctor.

“They didn’t give me a chance, give my husband a chance, to warm up the truck,” she said.

Her husband, Leon, recounted that while he was driving, “I actually see the baby’s head. I see the baby’s head right there. I’m like, Oh, my gosh. I pull over.”

Eight minutes after Wells and her husband got into their truck, Wells gave birth while they were parked on the side of the road.

“It was really a horrific situation to be treated like a dog, or not even like a dog, like less than,” Wells said.

""It says that they don’t care at all for Black women in health, and it’s hurtful,"" she said later. ""We thought that, you know, things have changed at this point in our country, and I don’t see a change.""

Her husband said he worried he could lose both wife and child in labor.

“The 'what ifs' kind of gets me messed up as a man and as a protective, as a husband,"" he said. “It was very hard to see my wife go through the situation.”

In a statement, Dallas Regional Medical Center said, in part, that it prioritizes “the safety, dignity, and well-being of our patients.”

On Friday, Franciscan Health Crown Point issued a formal apology to Wells, which was shared with NBC News. The hospital also confirmed that the nurse and doctor involved in the incident are no longer employed by the hospital.

“We failed to listen to Mrs. Wells’ concerns,” CEO Raymond Grady said in the statement. “We must fix what failed in our hospital so that no one experiences what happened to Mercedes Wells.”

Grady added that new policies are being implemented at the hospital in response to the incident, including mandatory cultural competency training for all labor and delivery staff. All pregnant patients in the labor and delivery unit must be examined by a physician before they leave the hospital.

""Compassionate concern is absent when a caregiver fails to listen to a patient who is clearly in pain and vulnerable,"" Grady said. ""The video was difficult to watch.""

Maternal mortality disparities

The maternal mortality rate for Black women in the United States is significantly higher than for other racial groups. Black women are three times likelier to die from childbirth than white women, with 50 deaths per 100,000 live births, compared with 14.5 deaths for white women, 12 deaths for Latinas and 10 for Asian women, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Black babies are likelier to die and to be born prematurely, which could contribute to health issues later in life, according to the CDC.

“That’s one of the starkest disparities in all of medicine, and most of these deaths are preventable. Delayed care — exactly what we saw in the videos — is one of the biggest contributors. And so for me, this isn’t an isolated moment,” said Dr. Joel Bervell, a physician and social media personality who spoke out about the videos.

“It’s impossible to ignore the statistics that back up that Black women are treated differently in the health care system,” he added.

Under a 1986 law called the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, staff members in emergency departments must stabilize patients who appear to be in active labor. But the definition of active labor can be subjective, said legal analyst Angela Cenedella, a lawyer who is not representing Jones or Wells. A patient can be turned away if a medical professional decides labor is not imminent.

“In those cases, if things do just change rapidly and a baby does come out faster than expected, that’s not necessarily a liability of the hospital. ... That’s really where the subjectivity exists,” she said, adding that if hospital staff members are negligent in decision-making “and don’t make decisions based on a reasonable standard of medical care, then there’s always a possibility for liability.”

'This should not happen to people'

U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly, D-Illinois, announced she will introduce legislation next week to prevent what happened to Wells from occurring again.

The Wells family has retained a lawyer, who has been in contact with hospital officials, NBC Chicago reported.

Texas lawmakers told NBC Dallas-Fort Worth they are meeting with hospital administrators about Jones' treatment.

""We will continue monitoring the investigation closely, maintain communication with hospital leadership, and work collaboratively to help restore trust and ensure that every person in our community receives fair and appropriate medical care,"" state Rep. Linda Garcia, a Democrat whose district includes part of Mesquite, said in a statement on social media.

While the incidents have now been seen by millions, the moments for Wells remain intimate and raw.

“I was actually watching [the Texas] video while in the labor and delivery room,” Wells said. “I didn’t think that it was about to happen to me.”

She added: “It shouldn’t happen to any woman. I don’t care race, ethnicity, anything, none of that should matter. This should not happen to people.”",figurative
"How NewJeans (almost) changed K-pop The girl group had a vision for how to rewire its troubled industry. The industry had other plans

toggle caption Jung Yeon-je/AFP via Getty Images

In March 2024, when the K-pop girl group NewJeans was awarded group of the year at Billboard's Women in Music event, the crew was presented the honor by the unlikeliest of advocates: country star Lainey Wilson, who hinted at the distance between their respective worlds and this rare opportunity to bridge them. ""It's a place where a gal who grew up in a small farming community in Louisiana gets to shine a light on an incredible group of K-pop performers from halfway across the globe,"" she said, applause roaring out before the group's name was even spoken. Indeed, the prized pony of ADOR, a sub-label of the juggernaut K-pop company HYBE, had spent the previous year affirming itself as an exciting next step in the genre's evolution. Billboard felt like the perfect American institution to recognize this leap: The 2023 EP Get Up had made NewJeans only the second K-pop girl group to top the Billboard 200, after Blackpink. But as the group performed ""Super Shy"" and ""ETA,"" Get Up's hits, the distance between the two units couldn't have been more apparent. Blackpink was the final benchmark of an old K-pop model; NewJeans was a brand new one.

For one thing, there was a profound understatement to the NewJeans performance — members gliding in and out of the lead spot with uncanny precision, distinct from the flamboyant mini-showcases that had come before. The sparkling fits, flowy choreo and muted music were impressive on their own, but the rush was in how seamlessly they worked together, telling a story about style. Where many K-pop groups spend their press runs trying to be all things to all listeners, NewJeans had spent its breakout year building an aesthetic niche to live in. Where some K-pop singles are so obsessed with now-ness that they feel out of time the moment they're born, NewJeans' songs seemed to be angling for something timeless. For a moment, it looked as if the group could be K-pop's future — if not a bellwether then at least a new barometer, and a message to the industry to reconsider how it does business. Yet only a month after the Billboard ceremony, that horizon became clouded in uncertainty: A power struggle erupted within HYBE for control of NewJeans' future, benching the group for over a year and dividing its fanbase. A surprise announcement this month promises that NewJeans will be back, but the long absence leading to this unsteady return has felt, to those paying attention to the genre's scandals over the years, like the latest evidence of a lingering rot.

Even many superfans will tell you that K-pop's pageantry has often masked a troubled business model, where impressionable young trainees commit to a life run entirely by their agencies. Signing on the dotted line can come with extraordinary expectations: plastic surgery, disordered eating, heavy restrictions on socializing. South Korea's Fair Trade Commission finally capped K-pop contracts at seven years after a 2009 controversy around the boy band TVXQ, who coined the term ""slave contract"" to describe its own 13-year agreement. K-pop was also at ground zero for the rise of toxic stan culture, from the doxxing of journalists to the cyberbullying of artists; one such star, Sulli of the girl group f(x), died by suicide in the midst of unrelenting harassment. Concerns over these practices have been a public talking point for years, but reform efforts rarely stick: In 2019, Yang Hyun-suk, co-founder of YG Entertainment, was forced to step down from the label after threatening a whistleblower to cover up a drug allegation facing one of his artists; he has since returned to YG and is helming the girl group Babymonster.

The industry famous for its finely honed artist development method, sometimes called the ""K-pop formula,"" has always lived with this tension: a creative philosophy with proven results, and a near-constant struggle for fairer relations between performers and the adults who oversee them. The latest and most public installment in this fight began last spring, with an outlier act suddenly at the center of the story.

In April 2024, NewJeans found itself caught in a quarrel between two corporate masters. On one side stood the top brass at HYBE, the largest of the country's ""big four"" entertainment agencies since it went public in 2020. On the other was one of their deputies: Min Hee-jin, CEO and founder of ADOR, who had launched NewJeans in 2022 and served as a creative director for its music. An industry veteran by the time she joined HYBE in 2019, Min had arrived touting progressive ideas for managing talent, already positioning her next group as an alternative to K-pop's star system. HYBE had given her the keys, but now alleged that an internal audit revealed she sought to seize total control of ADOR — and took steps to fire her. Min denied such a thing was possible, and claimed the falling-out actually stemmed from her complaints that the company had sidelined NewJeans, stifling its growth in favor of other girl groups it was launching. That August, ADOR announced Min had stepped down as CEO, while the producer insisted she had been forced out.

When asked, in an interview with the English-language newspaper Korea JoongAng Daily, why she and NewJeans were so committed to working together, Min attributed the closeness to her unique style of artist development, saying:

“I have had many thoughts and concerns after nearly 20 years in the entertainment industry. I felt it was crucial to change the rigid dynamic between producers and artists. I was concerned about how to guide young artists in a way that benefits their lives and the industry as a whole. In that context, NewJeans is like a child that comes from my heart and mind. Beyond my personal desire to support them, I aim to establish a new kind of relationship within a business model as a producer. That’s why I’m committed to this challenge and refuse to back down easily.”

Throughout the ordeal, the five members of NewJeans — Minji (now 21), Hanni (21), Danielle (20), Haerin (19) and Hyein (17) — publicly supported Min and called for her reinstatement, saying they would not continue without her. HYBE suggested a compromise: Min could stay on, but in a limited role as a music producer, an offer Min quickly denounced as a mockery of her mission. ""It is contradictory to accuse me of breach of trust while offering me a producer role. I chose to join because HYBE claimed they wanted to create a new wave and flow in K-pop. If those aspects hadn't been guaranteed, I wouldn't have even joined the company,"" she said in an interview with Japan's TV Asahi/ANN News program News Station. The only tenable way forward, she argued, was for her to continue as CEO, managing business and production in tandem.

By then, the issue had grown bigger than Min, with the NewJeans girls voicing their own criticisms of the parent company. Last September, in an impromptu YouTube livestream that played like a hostage video, the members called HYBE inhumane, detailing mistreatment and harassment. A month later, Hanni testified, through tears, before the South Korean National Assembly's Environment and Labor Committee, as a reference witness for an audit being conducted around workplace harassment and artist protection in the entertainment industry. She spoke about discrimination she and her groupmates faced at HYBE, and the resulting distrust. The case was ultimately dismissed, with the committee ruling that members of K-pop groups are not workers, and therefore are not entitled to labor protections.

Finally, on Nov. 28, 2024, NewJeans took matters into its own hands. At a press conference, the members announced the termination of their exclusive contract with ADOR, and vowed to seek the right to continue independently under the NewJeans name. The industry moved swiftly against them, with the Korea Management Federation and Korea Entertainment Producers' Association both siding with the company, the latter calling the act childish. Attempts to freelance under a new name, NJZ, were quickly thwarted. The group performed for the last time in February 2025, headlining at ComplexCon Hong Kong.

It took a year of legal limbo, with the group's musical activities stopped cold, before a pair of decisions put an end to the suspense. On Oct. 30, 2025, Seoul Central District Court ruled in favor of ADOR, saying that NewJeans must honor its contract and stay with the label through 2029. The members initially stuck to their guns, saying in a statement, ""It is impossible to return to ADOR and continue normal entertainment activities under the current situation where the trust relationship with ADOR has completely broken down."" They vowed to appeal the ruling, a case legal experts estimated would not be heard until well into 2026. Then came a twist that few saw coming: On Nov. 12, ADOR announced in a press release that the group's two youngest members, Hyein and Haerin, would be returning to the label, with no word on Minji, Danielle and Hanni. A few hours later, the three holdouts announced their intention to return as well — but through a news article, saying they had contacted ADOR but had not yet heard back. The label's response was a reluctant one: ""We are confirming the authenticity of their intentions.""

That abrupt, staggered homecoming may be the perfect distillation of the conflicting ideologies that have swirled around the group from all sides. Local reports claimed that Hyein's father — who had so strongly opposed their leaving the label that he entered a civil dispute with his wife over legal guardianship, citing a need for an ""environment where Hyein could focus on her career"" — was instrumental in bringing the younger girls back to ADOR. In contrast, The Korea Herald reported that Minji's mother had been a vocal supporter of Min and her position in the fight with HYBE. Meanwhile, Min herelf had moved on, announcing the start of her own indie agency just ahead of the court verdict. But she did release a statement giving her blessing for the group's return to ADOR, with the parting wish that they remain united. ""I can begin anew anywhere. But I believe that NewJeans must remain whole as five,"" Min said. ""I hope the members grow stronger and become an even better NewJeans, and above all, I wish happiness for all five members.""

The end of Min's label experiment points to something bigger at play, a tug-of-war that has long felt inescapable within K-pop. During the peak of the dispute, HYBE and the courts asserted there would be no disruption to the NewJeans operation under the proposed changes. But Min had intentionally designed ADOR, a boutique imprint with NewJeans as its only artist, to run counter to the HYBE system, binding artists' and producers' fates together in ways frankly radical for the genre. ""I wanted to have all of these come together,"" Min told Fast Company, describing the balance of art and commerce that made up her fantasy K-pop outfit. ""My definition of cool music, with my definition of a cool picture, with my definition of a great business. Business is, of course, important because if you don't make money with art, it would be kind of useless.""

Before launching ADOR, Min was one of the defining figures in K-pop aesthetics. As the creative director at SM Entertainment, she styled and designed concepts for Girls' Generation, SHINee, EXO, f(x) and Red Velvet, becoming the highest-paid woman in the industry in the process. ""I accomplished a lot of things when I was at SM, and I left because I was not really satisfied with my life there,"" she told Fast Company. ""But I'm not saying that I came here because I love this company; I needed a place where I could actualize my vision."" The ADOR way — which is to say, the NewJeans blueprint — was to defy what Min called ""conventional K-pop idol grammar"" and create a group for non-fanatics: a smooth, iterative sound that never resolves, snappy enough to generate earworms yet compact enough to not overstay its welcome.

""For most K-pop songs, there's always an intro and then the climax and the tension relieves again, because people think that having loops is boring,"" Min said in that interview. She was specifically referencing NewJeans' club-pop confection ""Super Shy,"" which artfully defies this climax-release principle by converting liquid drum and bass into blissful Powerpuff pizzazz. The song was co-written and -arranged by the Danish singer-songwriter Erika de Casier, and is imbued with her soft-focused, nostalgic take on Y2K-era R&B. In it, you can hear the NewJeans model at full bore: loopy, sugar-rush songcraft accented by airbrushed vocals. But most important is its holism: It is streamlined, even graceful, where many other K-pop recordings feel like Megazord constructions of the myriad artists who work on them. (EXO-K's ""History,"" for example, has two different bridges, one of which feels beamed in from a completely different song.)

The fragmented approach can be its own kind of endearing, but stitching together bits of tracks was not Min's way. ""There is a reason why we have composers make the songs! Sometimes, we'll adjust the top line, but we never go as far as to damage the real intention of the song,"" she said. Min's production MO was pointed defiantly away from the tried and true way of doing things, which took some collaborators by surprise. ""One of the first questions they asked me was, 'Do you listen a lot to K-pop?' "" de Casier told GQ in 2023. ""And I got so nervous and I had to be honest and said, 'No, I haven't yet explored that genre.' And they're like, 'Good, because we want something new. We want something fresh.' ""

K-pop can often sound oddly anachronistic, even when aiming at an explicitly retro sound, but NewJeans spun a mirage of the past into a modern teenage dream. The touchstones weren't unique ('90s streetwear, early aughts American prep, teen dramas), nor were the genres at play (new jack swing, synth-pop, Jersey and Baltimore club, Miami bass, throwback R&B); it was the ways in which they were remixed, the sense of curation and harmony at work and the way it all slotted neatly into a TikTok-induced optimization. A lot has been made of NewJeans' minimalism as a refreshing counter to K-pop maximalism, but the real innovation was its sepia-toned feel: K-pop as a moodboard come alive, revitalizing the old to the point of a full revolution. Some portion of that has to be attributed to the impresario-auteur at the reins and her master plan. ""These days people use the word producer kind of interchangeably as a composer. I'm a producer, but I don't make songs,"" Min said. ""I plan strategies.""

It is only through such acumen that you get the synergy of a dot-com-era obsessive like de Casier calibrating the group's filter for maximum effect. She is far from the first inspired pairing of choice Westerner and ascendant K-pop group — the late SOPHIE produced for ITZY; Carly Rae Jepsen co-wrote an f(x) song; Troye Sivan and Charli XCX worked on music for the giants BTS and TWICE, respectively — but in many of those songs you can often feel the discord of trying to force those artists to adapt to the agencies' market-tested structure. So much of the NewJeans synthesis came from those brought onto the creative team having no clue how K-pop usually works. ""It's hard [for me] to say how their music differs from other K‑pop songs — I think it's better for music critics to comment on that,"" Ylva Dimberg, one of the group's recurring writers and producers, told The Face. The primary NewJeans producer, 250, put forth a theory of K-pop music that seemed to align with the group's mandate: He asked a Swedish friend who headed a K-pop songwriting team what K-pop was, because he didn't really know, and the friend said it could be anything. ""People talk about 'the formula of K-pop.' But I don't really understand that, because K-pop is really just pop music made by Koreans,"" he told Nylon. ""So whatever we do, we don't need to follow any specific rules because no one can tell us something we made isn't K-pop.""

Not following rules seems to be precisely the strategy Min envisioned. To 250's point, the idea of a genre as omnivorous as K-pop having a central sound is ridiculous, but a unique song framework can still stand out. Most NewJeans songs don't have bridges; none have obligatory rap verses. All feel like they have been stripped to their essential parts, stringing hooks together like embroidery floss along a friendship bracelet, and all have a perfect grasp on the balance between Western and Eastern pop sensibilities. Much of that equilibrium seems to begin with the sessions themselves and the collaborators put in the room: a marriage between outsiders from the Korean industry and niche Scandinavian artists, adding up to an unfussy fusionist's phantasmagoria.

NewJeans' ""Supernatural,"" from June 2024, is the last single the group released before its hiatus. YouTube

It should be said: While ADOR's anti-system stance paid off handsomely as a creative ethic, it proved less effective in remaking the industry at the administrative level. Min was never a K-pop socialist — revolutionary by industry standards, certainly, but still longed to be a CEO fronting a business — and in time she inevitably found herself playing by the house rules, subject to the same industry politicking as other K-pop executives. (Among the evidence cited in October's court ruling were unearthed Slack messages from Min ordering subordinates to dig up dirt on other HYBE artists, which the court saw as grounds to declare breach of trust, misuse of personal information, infringement of trade secrets, defamation and abuse of power.) No one person could overhaul the entire enterprise, but Min's undoing feels like an especially revealing lesson in the limits of the master's tools.

K-pop is a copycat league. Not just in the musical sense — as when Girls' Generation ripped Duffy's ""Mercy"" for its own ""Dancing Queen,"" or when myriad K-pop groups followed the success of ""Despacito"" down the reggaeton rabbit hole — but also in its efforts to recreate the tactics of anything that brings in audiences (hence ""the K-pop formula,"" which is about replicating the paces of idol assembly down to the members' roles). The space vacated by NewJeans has been tough to fill, but that doesn't mean there haven't been one-off attempts to take a few laps in its lane. In Illit, a HYBE sister group whom Min accused of ripping off NewJeans wholesale, you can hear the same collage-like principle on songs like ""Magnetic"" and ""jellyous."" Olivia Marsh, the literal sister of NewJeans' Danielle, tunes her ""Strategy"" to a similar turn-of-the-millenium frequency. Several songs, from ifeye's ""IRL"" and HITGS' ""SOURPATCH"" to VIVIZ's ""Full Moon"" and izna's ""BEEP,"" have tried to recreate the bubblegum bass vibe of skipping rhythms and lush, light vocals; even TWICE got in on the fun last year. Others, like Hearts2Hearts' ""Blue Moon"" and RESCENE's ""Deja Vu,"" conjure the dreamy, rosy-eyed R&B-lite. All of these attempts are serviceable; many are even pleasant. But none quite recreate the mojo.

The contrast is, at least partly, in the roadmap. Min made an organizational practice of stockpiling good, complete songs and figuring out what to do with them later, whereas the traditional K-pop process involves building an elaborate concept around a plug-and-play single and treating it as a peg for months of extended rollout activities. NewJeans didn't do isolated campaigns or tossed-off B-sides; everything served the broader group architecture, something not to be taken for granted in K-pop's LARPing ecosystem, where artists transform between promo cycles. (Just look at the jarring transition from LE SSERAFIM's posed, subtle, disco-inflected ""Hot"" to the campy, lurid, rap-forward ""Spaghetti."") Min once said that the music itself was the concept with NewJeans, and simple as that seems, it's a key part of the group's appeal: There was an identifiable and qualifiable NewJeans sound, one that was singular and exclusive. It was clear what a New Jeans song was, and — just as crucially — what it wasn't, to the point of feeling intuitive. The group did all of the things inherent to K-pop groups, but it did so with a sense of taste top of mind.

The worst K-pop can feel like bad product placement: odious in its lack of subtlety, putting the commerce front and center and pretending otherwise, treating its ""idols"" like collectible dolls to generate shareholder value. It would be disingenuous to suggest that NewJeans was in any way immune to the genre's hazards of investment opportunity or marketing front — the video for ""ETA"" is an ad for the iPhone 14 Pro — but the group's promotion was far less gauche; it was purposeful, even, and shrewd in its movements. It was the influencer ideal: the mere presence doing much of the selling, of a vibe more than a commodity. There was a naturalness, at odds with the usual K-pop posturing, and the styling and choreography were in complete alignment with the music, which was clearly the main attraction. That is, perhaps, why this battle feels particularly distressing in an industry that is no stranger to scandal and corporate malpractice. It is disorienting for K-pop's most actualized act to become the face of its dysfunction.

It's impossible to say whether this is the beginning of the end for NewJeans. Perhaps, years from now, Min Hee-jin's dismissal will feel like the official death knell — or maybe it will be a blip in an otherwise successful career at ADOR. But it's also tempting to think of the what-ifs — the artistic and workplace breakthroughs that could have been made at the key turning points of this saga. What might the NewJeans arc have been had it continued uninterrupted, and could it have ushered in a new K-pop paradigm, or at least an alternative to the norm? What might the business look like had the Environment and Labor Committee heard Hanni's testimony as an elegy, a plea to bury the old ways? Min once mused, ""It can be scary to suggest something different. But once the suggestion is accepted, I think that's what writes new history."" Before us now is the other side of that coin: the suggestion rejected, the door closed on renewal, and a group once defined by its counterculture ethos headed back to the assembly line, to resume performing as though nothing has changed. K-pop is reliant on a blissful suspension of disbelief, the stage as a whimsical little pocket world — but it's hard to imagine the many layers of strained relationships here won't taint the NewJeans fantasy in ways that cannot be ignored.

In a recent interview with the Associated Press, SM Entertainment founder Lee Soo-man — Min's former boss and a key player in K-pop's global expansion — was asked his thoughts on the genre's darker controversies, from which his own company had scarcely been immune. (Recall TVXQ's ""slave contract"" controversy and Sulli's suicide — both SM artists.) Lee responded with another question: ""Should we always weigh the dark side equally with the bright side, the future?"" he asked. ""Media should consider whether K-pop represents more future or more past that holds us back. Rather than just discussing the dark side and dragging us down by clinging to the past, shouldn't we talk more about the future?"" I've been thinking about that a lot since I read it. It's a question premised on the idea that the past and future are partitioned from each other, and that the darkness is all in the rearview mirror. Yet if the NewJeans gauntlet is any indication, those tribulations are still far closer to us than they appear.",figurative
"Opinion: Forget the East Wing, let's take state dinners to the fair

toggle caption Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP

The East Wing of the White House has been demolished to make way for a huge ballroom that will host state dinners for up to a thousand people. But what to do until then?

I have never been to a state dinner. I have milled outside a few with other reporters to shout questions at some of the politicians and celebrities going in and out. Sometimes, they smile.

The menus of what's served are made public. They sound like first-rate fare, without being too daring: heirloom tomato soup, Iowa rib-eye steak, or Maine lobster, followed by maple pecan or orange chiffon cake. But as a couple of state dinner guests have told me — off the record, and with respect for the talented White House kitchen crew, you don't go to a state dinner for the food.

So in the pause while the rubble that was once the East Wing is cleared away, why not move state dinners to a different location? Why not hold them at the Iowa State Fairgrounds?

Yes, it would involve a flight. But if you use last summer's bill of fare as a guide, guests could walk from stand to stand, instead of being stuck in their seats for speeches. They could feast on a Chicken Pickle Ranch Rocket on a Stick, Flamin' Hot Cheetos Fries, a Full Mozzarella Korean Corn Dog, Maple Bacon-Flavored Cheese Curds, or Fairgrounds Fiesta Wontons, filled with egg salad and the size of catcher's mitts, deep-fried and then drizzled with hot honey and pico de gallo.

Now that's America!

For dessert: the Scotcheroo Shake — peanut butter and butterscotch ice cream swirled with Scotcheroo fudge, which is a mix of peanut butter, butterscotch, Rice Krispies and chocolate chips, crowned with whipped cream with caramel and chocolate drizzles.

You can imagine diplomats and politicians staggering into their limos after a fairgrounds state dinner, saying between belches, ""We must end these tariffs and open a Scotcheroo Shake Trade Route!""

And when it comes time for the toasts, heads of state can salute a long, fruitful friendship between countries with the bracing combination of pink lemonade and pickle juice known as a ""Pickled Pink.""

"For the first time in 35 years, Billboard’s Hot 100 chart does not include a rap song among its top 40 hit records. Anyone who’s been listening to the music for at least that long can list myriad reasons why that’s now the case: all the beats sound the same, all the artists are industry plants, all the lyrics are barely intelligible etc. For hip-hop forefather Abiodun Oyewole, though, it boils down to this: “We embraced ‘party and bullshit’, my brother.”

Fifty-seven years ago, on what would have been Malcolm X’s 43rd birthday, Oyewole cliqued up with two young poets at a writers’ workshop in East Harlem’s Mount Morris Park (now Marcus Garvey Park) to form what would become the Last Poets, a collective of bard revolutionaries. They outfitted themselves in African prints, performed over the beat of a congo drum and advocated for populism in their verses. The group has had many configurations over the years, but Oyewole, Jalal Mansur Nuriddin and Umar Bin Hassan abide as the standout members. The trio is all over the band’s self-titled first album – which was released in 1970 and peaked at No 29 on the Billboard 200. Their follow-up album, This Is Madness, made them ripe targets for J Edgar Hoover’s Cointelpro campaign against the emerging figures the then-FBI director deemed politically subversive. Notably, Oyewole could not contribute to that album because he had been incarcerated for an attempted robbery of a Ku Klux Klan headquarters, serving two and a half years of a three-year sentence. (He was trying to raise bail for activists who had been arrested for striking back at the Klan.)

Though dubbed “jazz poetry” at the time, the Last Poets’ tight rhythms, insurgent message and prevailing emphasis on Black consciousness would lay the foundation (along with fellow beatniks Gary Byrd and Gil Scott-Heron) for hip-hop music. Everyone from Melle Mel to KRS One to Common has paid some kind of homage to the Last Poets in their work. Oyewole’s “party and bullshit” line, which came from the song When the Revolution Comes on the Last Poets’ first album, would become the title and hook for the Notorious BIG’s debut single. Black comedians pay tribute to the Last Poets too with every one of their spoken word slam parodies.

Late last year, the Last Poets released an 11th studio album, Africanism, without Nuriddin (who died from cancer in 2018) that takes the some of group’s most resonant poems and sets them to the Afrobeat stylings of the late, great Tony Allen – the genre pioneer who came to prominence directing Fela Kuti’s band. “I’m blown away by the fact that Umar and I both said things that are extremely relevant today,” Oyewole says. “It’s so weird that these problems continue to exist.”

At age 77, Oyewole remains as attuned to the big issues as ever. With Bin Hassan, also 77, looking on (his speech has been somewhat limited after he suffered a pair of strokes in the last few years), Oyewole let his opinions fly over the course of our hourlong interview.

On Zohran Mamdani, a former wannabe emcee turned Democratic socialist, sweeping to victory in New York City’s mayoral election, Oyewole says: “This is all in divine order.”

On the escalation of political violence in Nigeria, a thorny issue Nicki Minaj clumsily waded into during a surprise recent appearance at the UN, Oyewole says: “We need to recognize that we are one and the same people, Africa and the diaspora, and make that union a lot tighter.”

On the fall of Kanye West, who is featured with Oyewole on the Common song The Corner: “Kanye got hooked on the bitches brew. He got stuck, strung out. I don’t know if you’ve seen Sinners, but Kanye West has been bitten.”

After Martin Luther King’s assassination in 1968, Oyewole says, “I wanted to become a serial killer.” In fact, some of those bitter feelings bubble back to the surface when Oyewole segues to the topic of Charlie Kirk’s death and rightwing efforts to recast Kirk as a civil rights martyr. “It’s embarrassing to have all the flags flying half mast in honor of a racist,” he says, “of someone who insulted every Black woman when he said Maxine Waters, Michelle Obama and Ketanji Brown Jackson weren’t smart. It’s embarrassing that Black people would say: ‘Well, I feel sorry for him.’ There’s nothing to feel sorry for.”

Oyewole credits Last Poets co-founder David Nelson for challenging him to express that rage in couplets instead. Earlier this month, while performing on the Soul Train cruise with a lineup that also included the Isley Brothers, Oyewole told guitarist Ernie Isley that their hit song It’s Your Thing inspired the first poem he ever wrote, What’s Your Thing, Brother? – a greeting that Oyewole heard often in the 1960s among activist-minded Black New Yorkers trying to suss out one another’s political bents. You better get a thing before you lose everything, the poem goes.

The Last Poets’ grounding in Black pride and political purpose became heirlooms that were carried forward in the hip-hop movement – that critical last word intended as much to rally listeners to the dancefloor as join them in common cause against political oppression. It’s a conjoining of ideals that began in earnest with Grandmaster Flash & the Furious Five’s breakout The Message, which sets the story of the Bronx’s 1980s-era crime and dereliction to synth rhythms and breakbeats. Over the decades, rap’s practitioners have dutifully upheld the Black American oral tradition of fighting the power and passing down knowledge of self while also serving up plenty of dancefloor hits. Even Biggie followed up Party & Bullshit on his debut album with Things Done Changed, a reflection on the harsh realities of his Bedford-Stuyvesant Brooklyn community.

But Oyewole doesn’t hear that same range of awareness or sense of urgency in hip-hop that is being pushed by the music industry today. “Our music has always been a reflection of our living,” he says, “but we’re dying spiritually.” To underscore his point, he references to an early poem of Bin Hassan’s that was revived for Africanism called Niggers Are Scared of Revolution – a flash of recognition that perked up his bandmate. “I was a shoeshine boy, going to bars and everything,” Bin Hassan says, “listening to people talk about who they are, from gang members to masters of the world. I had to take the language.”

The poem was meant to be a criticism on the N-word’s repurposing into a term of endearment – but that message backfired as hip-hop effectively sold its soul to secure its prime position in pop culture. “They even changed the feature character from cat to dog,” Oyewole says. “Back in the day when I was growing up, it was: ‘Man, that cat can play the piano’ or ‘That’s a cool cat.’ But now it’s: ‘Yo dog, that’s my dawg … ’

“No, I am not your dog.”

Hip-hop’s outsized role in making the language of Black disparagement more palatable, Oyewole further argues, has only made it easier for Donald Trump (whom he calls “the Taco Man”) and his white supremacist acolytes in government to deny Black excellence in their policy-driven attacks against critical race theory and DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion). Nevertheless, Oyewole is confident and remains hopeful that those efforts will backfire too, and that the Last Poets’ mission of returning the power to the people will ultimately win out.

“In times of great chaos, there’s opportunity,” he says. “The Taco Man and his efforts to ban books and erase our history? All he’s really doing, in a weird way, is promoting us. But he doesn’t realize that because he’s not smart.”",figurative
"As you age, you gradually lose muscle mass and gain visceral body fat, a type of fat deep inside your body that surrounds your heart, kidneys and other organs. Now, scientists say the ratio of visceral fat to muscle can uncover clues about your brain health.

People with higher muscle mass and a lower visceral fat-to-muscle ratio tend to have younger brains, according to research being presented next week at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America.

“We know that the age of a person, in terms of their appearance, might not match with their chronological age,” said senior study author Dr. Cyrus Raji. “Turns out, the age of their organs might not match their chronological age either.”

One reason the findings are so important is because chronological age — and therefore an aging brain — is “by far” the top risk factor for developing Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia, said Raji, an associate professor of radiology and neurology at the Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.

“Risk of disease crosses organ systems,” Raji said. “Disease doesn’t just neatly respect the anatomical boundaries of one organ system.”

Previous research, including Raji’s own, has studied the relationship between visceral fat and health outcomes such as brain volume loss, cognitive impairment and structural changes in the brain.

The study involved 1,164 healthy people whose average chronological age was 55.17. About 52% were women and 39% were nonwhite. All underwent a whole-body MRI that looked at brain, fat and muscle tissue.

To determine participants’ brain age, Raji and his colleagues used an algorithm that had been trained on the MRI scans of 5,500 healthy adults ages 18 to 89. The average brain age of study participants was 56.04 — older than their average chronological age. Researchers called this difference the “brain age gap.”

The average brain age gap was 0.69 years, meaning participants’ brains looked slightly older than they should. However, this metric was not statistically significant.

Just as higher muscle mass and a lower visceral fat-to-muscle ratio corresponded to a younger brain age, lower muscle mass and a higher visceral fat-to-muscle ratio corresponded to an older brain age.

This link between body fat and brain age only held true for visceral fat, which is also known as hidden fat, active fat or deep belly fat. Subcutaneous fat, the layer of fat just below the skin’s surface, wasn’t associated with brain age, the study found.

“Visceral fat, which is the really terrible fat, [is] linked to a higher rate of diabetes, insulin resistance, prediabetic states, high cholesterol,” Raji said. “That leads to a higher inflammatory state in the body, which over time affects the brain. That’s the main mechanism by which we believe obesity can affect risk for Alzheimer’s disease.”

BMI reveals little of body composition

From a clinical perspective, the study results are on par with what Dr. Zhenqi Liu, the James M. Moss professor of diabetes at the University of Virginia School of Medicine, would expect.

“When people are very young and healthy, they tend to have more muscle mass and they will have [a] younger brain age,” said Liu, who wasn’t involved in the research.

Older adults, on the other hand, especially those living with chronic diseases such as diabetes or obesity, usually have lower muscle mass, Liu added. “I wouldn’t be surprised if their brain volume is decreased.”

Even so, the study reinforces that muscle health is vital to overall health, Liu said.

The limitations of body mass index, or BMI, as a measure of health are also on display in this research, Liu said. BMI is a standardized, nearly 200-year-old body fat metric calculated using your height and weight. But it’s fallen out of favor in recent years, namely because it doesn’t take into account how your fat — neither visceral nor subcutaneous — is distributed throughout your body.

A BMI of 30 or higher falls into the obese category. For Raji, his latest work demonstrates how a low BMI could disguise poor brain health.

“If you have more visceral fat and less muscle, you can have an older-looking brain,” Raji said. “That makes sense in terms of Alzheimer’s being a big risk factor — regardless of whatever the BMI would show.”

Liu favors two other approaches to assessing body composition. The first is waist circumference. Measurements beyond 35 inches for women or 40 inches for men increase your risk of heart disease and Type 2 diabetes, according to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. The second metric is the waist-hip ratio, which involves dividing your waist circumference by your hip circumference. According to the World Health Organization, this ratio shouldn’t exceed 0.85 for women or 0.9 for men.

Still, you can’t accurately measure your own visceral fat unless your doctor refers you for an MRI, which can assess the amount of fat under the skin and surrounding the organs. An elective full-body scan can cost up to $5,000.

The good news is, there are steps you can take to increase muscle mass and lower visceral fat without spending a dime.

How to build muscle and burn visceral fat

If it’s been ages since you’ve touched a dumbbell or gone for a long walk, fear not, said Siddhartha Angadi, a colleague of Liu’s and an associate professor of kinesiology at UVA’s School of Education and Human Development.

“Anyone can exercise — regardless of their age,” said Angadi, who wasn’t involved in the research. “There’s excellent data across the lifespan, across the health span, across multiple diseases showing that exercise is incredibly safe.”

Angadi recommends following the American College of Sports Medicine’s physical activity guidelines. At least twice a week, healthy adults 65 and younger are encouraged to do muscle-strengthening activities that work all major muscle groups.

“Do 10 to 15 different exercises,” Angadi said. “You want to do one to three sets; in each set, you want to have eight to 12 reps. Use machines if you’re not familiar with resistance training, which is a fancy way of saying weightlifting.”

Aerobic exercise is particularly effective at targeting visceral fat, Angadi said. The guidelines suggest 150 minutes of moderately intense aerobic activity every week.

“There’s nothing that can reverse brain aging,” Angadi said. “You can just slow the rate of it.”

Glenn Gaesser, a professor of exercise physiology at the Arizona State University College of Health Solutions, said baby steps can help build muscle and burn visceral fat.

“A lot of people think that it takes a lot to produce some sort of health benefit from exercise, and that is not necessarily true,” said Gaesser, who wasn’t part of the study. “The biggest return on investment is with the initial few minutes of exercise.”

For example, if you’re striving for the recommended 150 minutes of aerobics per week, your body will benefit most in those first 30 minutes, Gaesser said.

“Same with resistance training,” Gaesser said. “A lot of people may not want a gym membership, they may not want to go and lift weights, but you can do resistance training even with the weight of your own body.”

While Raji’s research doesn’t conclude that higher muscle mass and a lower visceral fat-to-muscle ratio guarantee better brain health, it spotlights the relationship between the brain and the musculoskeletal system, Gaesser said. When you work out, your muscles release chemical signals thought to positively influence the brain and other tissues.

“This is why individuals who perform regular exercise tend to have lower risk of cognitive decline, dementia, Alzheimer’s and the like,” Gaesser said. “If you want a healthy brain, you need to have healthy muscle.”

Gaesser added, “It’s not surprising that the single best predictor of whether or not you’re going to spend the last years of your life in a nursing home or assisted living is fitness.”

Strength training crucial for healthy weight loss

In October, Michael Snyder turned 70, an age when muscle mass and strength are naturally in decline. He’s also taking a GLP-1 medication for diabetes.

As GLP-1 usage has surged in recent years, so too has awareness of the decline in muscle mass that can accompany significant weight loss, said Snyder, the Stanford W. Ascherman professor of genetics at the Stanford University School of Medicine, who wasn’t part of the study.

“If you’re on [GLP-1s], you should be strength training,” Snyder said. “I lift weights every day.”

Dr. David D’Alessio, chief of the division of endocrinology, metabolism and nutrition at the Duke University School of Medicine, stressed that muscle loss isn’t unique to people taking GLP-1s.

“If you lose weight by restricting calories — that is, going on a diet — or if you lose weight by bariatric surgery, or if you lose weight by taking Ozempic, you’re going to lose some fat mass and some lean mass,” said D’Alessio, who wasn’t involved in the study. “It’s going to be about 30% lean, 70% fat. About half of lean mass on these measures is muscle.”

Even for people who aren’t trying to lose weight, strong muscles are necessary for a long, healthy life, Snyder said.

“There’s a ton of interest in longevity these days,” Snyder said. “Everybody wants to live forever, and to do that, you’re going to want to keep your mass up.”",literal
"Black Friday and Cyber Monday aren’t sprints anymore; they’ve fused together into a shopping marathon. Instead of one day for in-store deals and another for online promos, retailers now host weeks-long events, prompting experts to coin the term Black November (which feels much more accurate, if you ask me).

More time to shop is beneficial — you can spread out spending, carefully compare deals and buy popular products before they sell out. But it also means you need to strategize beyond making a mental wishlist. It’s easy to get overwhelmed by the hundreds of sales out there, and the last thing you want to do is impulse buy or overspend, especially if tariffs shrank your budget this year.

To help you make a Black Friday and Cyber Monday game plan, I put together this guide filled with tips and tricks I swear by after covering the sales for over five years. I also talked to experts to get their advice about what to buy, what to skip and how to save the most. I’ll frequently update this article throughout the next two weeks.

Head’s up: Black Friday and Cyber Monday will be different this year

Before I get into the nitty-gritty, there are two important things to know about Black Friday and Cyber Monday this year:

Deals won’t be as fantastic as usual, but they’re still worthwhile.

Believe me, this is not the news I wanted to hear either. But tariffs are impacting Black Friday and Cyber Monday, and it’s important to understand how so you can manage your expectations and strategize appropriately.

Here’s the deal: To avoid drastically increasing prices for customers, most retailers are currently partially absorbing tariff costs, which limits how much they can afford to discount products and still make a profit. “Retailers will still give us Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals, but less of them, and discounts won’t be as deep,” says Erik Guzik, an assistant clinical professor of management and entrepreneurship at the University of Montana College of Business. “In the past, we may have expected a 40% to 50% discount, but this year, 20% to 30% may be what we need to consider quite good, especially in areas that have been targeted by tariffs, like clothing, footwear, toys and electronics.”

That doesn’t mean deals aren’t worth shopping. They absolutely are, especially since experts expect consumer goods prices to increase in 2026. “Any discount at this point is positive,” says Guzik. Most retailers overstocked their warehouses before the new tariff policy took effect to avoid increased duties, but once that inventory is gone, they’ll have to import items and pay higher tariff rates, giving them no choice but to increase products’ prices in most cases, says Guzik.

If you don’t shop early, you’re doing it wrong.

All the experts I talked to have one main piece of advice for shoppers: hurry. Because retailers are discounting products during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, while partially absorbing the cost of tariffs, their profit margins are quite low. That will probably cause them to limit product quantities, like only putting 500 models of a certain TV on sale rather than 1,000, which means you’ll see items go out-of-stock quicker than usual, says Ronald Goodstein, an associate professor of marketing at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business.

The overall takeaway? “Once you see that discount, it’s probably the best one we’re getting this holiday season,” says Guzik. “Waiting to see if deals get better, which likely won’t be the case, is more risky than ever. Shop early, because once an item goes out of stock, it probably won’t come back.”

What to shop during Black Friday and Cyber Monday

Tariffs are making them less flashy than usual, but Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales still offer the deepest discounts across the biggest selection of products all year. That means (almost) everything on your wishlist will likely be on sale. The best deals, however, tend to fall within four categories: tech, toys, small home and kitchen appliances, and subscriptions and experiences. “These are the categories where retailers go big early, and prices are already strong,” says Stephanie Carls, a retail insights expert at RetailMeNot. Below, I break down what to look for in each category and examples of popular products I expect to be on sale — some early deals are already live.

Tech

There’s no better time of year to buy tech than Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Most brands drop prices on TVs, laptops, video game consoles, headphones, speakers, smart home products, smartwatches and more by about 30 to 50%, says Ashley Feinstein Gerstley, a shopping and savings strategist at Rakuten, and you’ll find lots of tech listed at its lowest price ever.

If you’re specifically in the market for video game consoles, there’s no shortage of deals during Black Friday and Cyber Monday from top brands like Nintendo and PlayStation. And beyond discounts on individual consoles, controllers and games, brands usually sell exclusive bundles as some of their best offers of the year. Our team is always waiting for the Nintendo Switch bundle to drop around Black Friday, for example. Last year, it came with the original Nintendo Switch, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and a 12-month subscription to Nintendo Switch Online for $299.98 — that’s $79.99 less than if you bought each item separately. This year, we’re eyeing Nintendo Switch 2 bundles like the Nintendo Switch 2 + Pokémon Legends: Z-A Bundle.

Toys

Toys are among the most competitive categories during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, both in terms of discounts and demand. The most popular toys sell out quickly (I’m talking a couple of hours, maximum), so once you see prices drop, buy your must-haves immediately. Legos, Barbies, Hot Wheels, Hasbro board games, Tamagotchis — they’ll be on sale and they’ll go fast.

Small home and kitchen appliances

Almost every small home and kitchen appliance you can think of gets discounted this month, so now is the time to buy that Vitamix blender or Dyson vacuum you’re dreaming about. In addition to items you use year-round, keep an eye on seasonal appliances, like space heaters and snow blowers, as well as tableware, home decor and other essentials you’ll need to host guests during the holidays, says Gerstley.

Subscriptions and experiences

Tangible products aren’t the only things discounted on Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Almost every company that sells something hops on the bandwagon, and in recent years, we’ve seen discounts on subscriptions to TV, music and educational platforms. In 2024, for example, you could get a year-long Hulu subscription for $0.99 per month (normally $9.99 a month) and an annual MasterClass subscription for 50% off. There are deals on experiences, too, like travel packages, fitness classes and spa treatments, especially at local businesses in your area.

What not to shop during Black Friday and Cyber Monday

If you’re trying to narrow down your shopping list, Carls recommends waiting to buy everyday apparel (especially cold-weather pieces), beauty products and furniture. “Those tend to drop more in December when stores start clearing inventory,” she says. You can skip mattresses, too, as well as large home and kitchen appliances — discounts tend to be just as good around President’s Day.

Expert shopping tips: Black Friday and Cyber Monday do’s and don’ts

As I mentioned above, Black Friday and Cyber Monday aren’t spirits anymore; they’re a shopping marathon. Those who plan for it will save the most, so to help you strategize, I rounded up a list of dos and don’ts based on my 5+ years of experience covering sales, as well as experts’ advice.

Don’t: Skip early deals

It bears repeating because it’s that important this year: “If it’s a good price and the exact model you want, grab it,” says Carls. Limited inventories and products going out of stock are certainties, not predictions, so it’s better to buy now than panic later. 73% of consumers plan to start holiday shopping before Cyber Week, according to RetailMeNot — if you're in the minority, I suggest rethinking your strategy.

Do: Make a shopping list

Making a mental shopping list isn’t nearly as useful as writing it down, whether on paper or your phone’s notes app. Some retailers also let you create wishlists on their websites or curate a cart and save it for later. Referring to your shopping list helps you hold yourself accountable for buying what you actually need rather than filling your cart with impulse purchases.

Once you’ve nailed down your list, rank order it, says Henry Jin, a professor of supply chain management at Miami University’s Farmer School of Business. “You’re only saving money if you’re paying less for things you’ve always wanted or really need,” he says. “Rank order your wish list based on the greatest need, and recognize that the items on the bottom of that list may be aspirational purchases you can delay for now.”

Do: Set a budget

Think about the grand total you’re comfortable spending this season, factoring in costs like gifts (for yourself and others), travel, hosting expenses, gift wrapping supplies and shipping fees, says Gerstley. Put a chunk of that aside for Black Friday and Cyber Monday, and build in what Gerstley calls a “fun buffer” to give you room for a spontaneous splurge or two without feeling stressed. Also, before shopping for holiday gifts, talk to your loved ones about budgets beforehand so everyone is on the same page.

Do: Get cozy with your favorite retailers

Sign up for your favorite brands’ email newsletters, SMS lists and push app alerts, and follow them on social media. Companies often use these channels to update shoppers about flash sales, limited-edition drops, new deals and extra promos you might be able to stack on top of the discount.

Do: Stack savings

Retailers likely aren’t slashing prices as much as they have in years past, but stacking savings can take a deal from good to great. On top of getting the discount, paying with a credit card that lets you earn points as you spend, downloading cashback extensions, adding extra promo codes and coupons and shopping on websites with free shipping are all ways to put money back in your pocket, says Carls.

Don’t: Ignore shipping fees and where products ship from

No one wants to pay for shipping, but if you’re shopping online, you’re at the mercy of the retailer, says Jin. Shipping fees can drive up the price of your purchase, so try to avoid them if you can. One of the best ways to do so is buying online and picking up in-store, and doing the bulk of your shopping at retailers whose loyalty programs you’re part of, like Amazon Prime, Walmart+ and Target Circle, all of which offer free shipping as a perk.

During Black Friday and Cyber Monday, some retailers also offer free shipping if you spend a certain amount, so look out for those offers. But be aware that the minimum order required to unlock free shipping might be higher than you’re used to due to tariffs. “A way for retailers to absorb some of the higher expenses is to require customers to spend more in order to qualify for free shipping,” says Jin.

Also, pay attention to where products ship from before you check out. Sometimes retailers don’t disclose that information, but if they do, and your products are shipping from outside the U.S., you may have to pay additional tariffs since the de minimis exception ended this summer. Experts also recommend only shopping from retailers you’re familiar with — buying from those you’re unfamiliar with means there’s a greater chance for surprises to pop up. And since you don’t have experience with them, you won’t be able to recognize red flags, like exorbitant shipping fees.

Do: Comparison shop

During major sale events, retailers usually sell the same products for the exact (or almost exact) same prices, a practice called price chasing. In these cases, deciding where to buy comes down to the details. Compare shipping fees, stackable promo codes and coupons, cashback offers, return policies, extended warranties and reward points you might be eligible for. You can also set up price drop alerts through certain retailers’ websites, like Amazon, or through tools like Keepa, CamelCamelCamel and Honey, so you’ll immediately know if any brands discount an item more than you expected them to. Comparison shopping helps you “cherry pick” deals so you get the absolute lowest price on each item, rather than blindly doing all your shopping at one place and potentially sacrificing savings, says Goodstein.

Do: Track prices

Retailers sometimes raise prices prior to major sales like Black Friday and Cyber Monday, and at NBC Select, we follow specific criteria to evaluate deals before recommending them. We use price trackers like CamelCamelCamel, Honey and Keepa to evaluate an item’s price history and determine if it’s actually a good deal or just temporarily marked down from an inflated baseline. You can use these sites to track prices, too.

Don’t: Forget to read return and price matching polices

Most retailers let you return Black Friday and Cyber Monday purchases within a certain timeframe, and some even offer an extended return policy around the holidays. Make sure you actually read retailers’ return policies so you know when you’ll have to send something back by, if needed — no one wants to get stuck with a product they don’t want.

Also, research what retailers have return policies, especially since shopping early is so important this year. If an item drops in price within the two weeks after you buy it, for example, some retailers will honor the lower price and refund you the difference, says Goodstein.

Frequently asked questions When do Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales start? Black Friday is on Nov. 28, 2025, and Cyber Monday is on Dec. 1, 2025. Some deals are already live, and by the week before Black Friday, most will be in full swing. When do Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales end? The strongest sales end on Cyber Monday, but since many people shop for holiday gifts through mid-December, retailers continue to offer discounts. That said, they’re typically weaker compared to those during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, and there’s a smaller volume of deals, so you have fewer options to choose from. Is there a difference between Black Friday and Cyber Monday anymore? No, there’s not a difference between Black Friday and Cyber Monday anymore, says Goodstein. The line between them has completely blurred since they’re no longer separate, one-day events, where one focuses on in-store deals and the other on online deals. They’ve morphed into a weeks-long savings period experts call Black November, during which you can shop online and in stores for any product imaginable. At this point, the main difference between Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals is the terminology retailers use. They usually use “Black Friday” language now through the Saturday after the shopping holiday, and swap to “Cyber Monday” language by Sunday. Otherwise, the majority of discounts and the product selection remain completely identical. Are there better deals on Cyber Monday? There are usually no better deals on Cyber Monday. Sales tend to mirror Black Friday, though retailers may add a few new limited-time promotions to their assortments. Overall, it’s best to think of Cyber Monday as your absolute last chance to shop. Should you shop in-store or online during Black Friday? There are pros and cons to shopping in-store and online during Black Friday. Consider these factors while making your decision: Online shopping is more convenient than in-store shopping, and it’s easier to compare prices across sites. Retailers also offer a wider variety of discounts online. Retailers want to make in-store shopping a special experience for customers on Black Friday, so they may offer exclusive deals and gifts with purchase at their locations. Shopping in-store lets you try on and touch items, and take them home that day. You’ll likely have to pay shipping fees if you shop online, but you can avoid them by shopping in person. To get the best of both worlds, buy online and pick up in-store when possible. What is Travel Tuesday? Travel Tuesday is dedicated to deals on flights, hotels and cruises, but brands also host sales on related products like suitcases and toiletry bags. Travel Tuesday falls on the day after Cyber Monday, so this year it’s on Dec. 2.

"Opinion: Jamal Khashoggi's words live forever

Enlarge this image toggle caption Mohammed Al-Shaikh/AFP via Getty Images Mohammed Al-Shaikh/AFP via Getty Images

When President Trump welcomed Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to the Oval Office this week, a reporter asked about Jamal Khashoggi. The Saudi journalist was murdered in 2018, according to U.S. intelligence agencies, in an operation approved by the Crown Prince.

""You're mentioning somebody that was extremely controversial,"" the president replied. ""A lot of people didn't like that gentleman that you're talking about. Whether you like him or didn't like him, things happen.""

Jamal Khashoggi came from a prominent Saudi family but fled his country in June, 2017, after he'd become increasingly critical of his government. He said he'd been banned from using Twitter.

Sponsor Message

He began to write columns for The Washington Post with a candid admission:

""It was painful for me several years ago when several friends were arrested,"" he wrote. ""I said nothing. I didn't want to lose my job or my freedom. I worried about my family. I have made a different choice now. I have left my home, my family and my job, and I am raising my voice. To do otherwise would betray those who languish in prison. I can speak when so many cannot.""

The following summer, the Crown Prince lifted the traditional ban on women driving. But first his government arrested numerous women's rights advocates, accusing them of ""nefarious contacts with foreign parties.""

""The message is clear to all,"" wrote Khashoggi. ""Activism of any sort has to be within the government, and no independent voice or counter-opinion will be allowed. Everyone must stick to the party line.""

Just a few months after he wrote those words, Khashoggi entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul to pick up documents for his marriage. His fiancée waited outside for him, for hours. Khashoggi never got out of that building.

But his voice went on. His last column, published after his death, called for free expression in the Arab world, and warned that the region's governments ""have been given free rein to continue silencing the media.""

Khashoggi knew as he wrote that some powerful people could find his words not just ""extremely controversial,"" as President Trump put it, but threatening to their power. He wrote them anyway, whether they liked him or not.",figurative
"Books We Love: These were NPR staffers' favorite plot-driven books of 2025

AYESHA RASCOE, HOST:

Folks, if you can, get out a pen and paper because we're about to talk about some of our favorite books of the year, and you might want to jot a few of these titles down. With us to talk about NPR's annual interactive books roundup, Books We Love, is Andrew Limbong, host of NPR's Book Of The Day podcast. Thanks for being with us.

ANDREW LIMBONG, BYLINE: Hey, Ayesha.

RASCOE: We love this time of year. But for listeners who aren't familiar, tell them about Books We Love.

LIMBONG: It is not just, like, a best of - here's the 10 best books you've got to read in 2025, right? We ask everyone at NPR - so we got editors and producers and people on the business side and all that stuff. We asked them what their favorite books of the year were. This year, we're in the neighborhood of 380 books, which is a lot. But the size and scope is sort of the whole point.

RASCOE: So what have you got for us?

LIMBONG: All right, well, word on the street, I hear that someone on your staff is looking for something plotty (ph).

RASCOE: OK.

LIMBONG: So one of the books I personally recommended was a Emma Pattee's ""Tilt."" Now, this is a book about a woman. She's super-duper pregnant, and she's at an IKEA running an errand when an earthquake happens. And it's a really speedy book because at its core, it is a very - person has to go from point A to point B, right? She's got to find her way home out of this IKEA in a Portland that has been ravaged by an earthquake, and she runs into a few obstacles here and there, and she sort of has to be on the move. But what it is also is a critique or a pretty funny send-up of the ""Keeping Up With The Joneses"" of parenthood - right? - you know, that feeling where if you don't buy the fanciest schmanciest bajillion-dollar stroller, you are a failure.

RASCOE: Yeah.

LIMBONG: It's sort of poking at that and asking some interesting questions about motherhood and marriage and relationships, all while being straight up an action-adventure book.

Another sort of plotty book is Kashana Cauley's ""The Payback."" This is a bit of a heist novel about a woman and her friends who concoct a bit of a ""Ocean's Eleven"" type caper to wipe out everyone's student loans. This isn't necessarily taking place in our world. It's in a bit of a heightened world where there are these special cops on the hunt for anyone who is late to repay their debts, and they will track you down and kind of assault you if you're late on your repayment. It's a pretty thrilling read.

RASCOE: OK. Well, what about nonfiction?

LIMBONG: Yeah. I know - we're at the time of year where a lot of families are traveling, right? And traveling can be stressful. So a book I've been thinking about is called ""A Marriage At Sea"" by Sophie Elmhirst, right? It's about a young British couple in the '70s who decide they want to sell everything off and sail to New Zealand. Things don't go great (laughter). And they end up floating on a life raft in the Pacific. It's a deeply reported book, but it does also make me think, like, oh, maybe me dragging my partner to the airport and the plane is delayed - things could be worse than having to eat stale McDonald's fries. You know what I mean?

RASCOE: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

LIMBONG: (Laughter) While we're talking about nonfiction, there's also this book called ""Fetishized"" by Kaila Yu. And this is a essay collection about having mixed feelings about being objectified. She was a former model, and so she cops to catering for what we might call the male gaze, but she is also aware of the broader political, cultural baggage that doing that can have. And so I think it's an interesting insight into a weird slice of life.

RASCOE: So what's a book that you recommend personally?

LIMBONG: One of the books I put up for Books We Love was called ""The Rest Of Our Lives"" by Ben Markovits. This was actually one of the finalists for the Booker Prize. It's about a guy whose wife cheated on him a while back, but he swore not to do anything about it until they became empty nesters - right? - until their youngest was off in college. And so the book follows him dropping his daughter off at school and then going on a road trip. He doesn't have a destination in mind. He just is sort of driving to drive and to figure things out.

I was a bit trepidatious about this novel. I thought it would be - people in books discourse have been thinking a lot about men - right? - men in books and men in literature. And I thought it was going to be a very, like - here's the answers about all the problems plaguing men kind of book. But it's actually this really quiet and sweet and intimate book about a guy just trying to find some roots in some of the people he's sort of lost touch with.

RASCOE: That's NPR's Andrew Limbong. Thank you so much, Andrew.

LIMBONG: Thanks, Ayesha.

RASCOE: And Books We Love publishes tomorrow morning at 7 a.m. Eastern. You can find it online at npr.org/bestbooks.

"Science is a slaughterhouse. We rarely acknowledge the degree to which animal life underwrites the research that provides us with medicines, or the regulation that keeps us safe. Live animals were used in 2.64m officially sanctioned scientific procedures in the UK in 2024, many of them distressing or painful and many of them fatal. But the government’s new strategy to phase out animal testing – published earlier this month – suggests that in the near future emerging technologies can largely replace the use of animals in our scientific endeavours.

The UK previously banned cosmetics testing on animals, and has already taken steps to regulate and reduce their use in research. But some needlessly cruel experiments still take place: the forced swim test (FST) for example, in which a rodent is placed in a body of water it cannot escape and researchers measure whether antidepressants extend the time it struggles for life. The government says no new FST licences will be granted, in effect banning it. Similar targets are set over the next few years to end the testing of caustic chemicals on eyes and skin.

This is welcome, but there are many other widespread practices – such as giving mice tumours to research cancer – which most people would still consider acceptable, despite their obvious barbarity. When animal wellbeing is pitted so starkly against human benefit, our collective compassion has a limit. The government will succeed only if it can convince scientists and the public that these longstanding and trusted experimental methods can be replaced with something as good or better.

Fortunately, there are emerging alternatives. So-called organ-on-a-chip systems, which use lab-grown cells arranged into a miniature network that can simulate complex bodily systems, are already in use. And machine learning systems are proving as adept at predicting potential toxic effects from medicines as they have been at predicting protein structures. These approaches won’t always provide perfect insight into how a given treatment might work for humans, but of course neither do animal tests. Undergraduate scientists are still taught these classic cautionary tales: paracetamol is toxic to dogs and cats, while thalidomide was shown to be safe in rats.

Unlike the slogans and aspirations in its AI strategy, the government appears to have a real plan for applying these technologies. There is £60m in direct funding committed– and a focus on identifying specific animal research methods currently in use, measuring their effectiveness and validating animal-free alternatives that could provide similar results. And it is heartening that the strategy maps out several points over the next decade when specific alternative methods are expected to mature, rather than gesturing at technology in general as a panacea.

This is an opportunity for both scientific and economic progress. Animal testing isn’t just cruel, it is expensive and time-consuming. The EU and US have similarly committed to reduce animal experimentation, so there will be rewards for developing technology and knowhow that can be applied worldwide. But most importantly, there is a moral imperative to free these animals. Previous governments greatly reduced the number of so-called charismatic species – animals favoured by humans such as dogs and horses – used in experiments. Today, 95% of lab animals in the UK are rodents, birds or fish. Do they not deserve the same consideration?",literal
"After two decades and an estimated cost of $1bn, the Grand Egyptian Museum opens its doors to the public on Tuesday.

After two decades and an estimated cost of $1bn, the Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM) opened its doors to the public on Tuesday, just a few days after the official opening ceremony on Saturday.

Regarded as the world’s largest archaeological facility for a single civilisation, the museum is located 2km (1.2 miles) from the pyramids of Giza and 8km (5 miles) from the capital, Cairo.

The complex spans nearly 500,000sq metres (5,381,900sq ft) and will house more than 100,000 ancient artefacts from the 30 dynasties of ancient Egypt.

Some of the main attractions include the 3,200-year-old, 11.36-metre (37ft) statue of King Ramses II, the complete collection of Tutankhamun’s treasures and a 4,500-year-old boat, one of the oldest intact ships in the world, belonging to Khufu, the pharaoh renowned for building the Great Pyramid of Giza.

The Grand Egyptian Museum’s design

The museum has been called the “fourth pyramid” of the Giza Plateau, which is home to three pyramids about 4,500 years old: the Great Pyramid of Giza (built for Pharaoh Khufu), the Pyramid of Khafre (built for Pharaoh Khafre) and the Pyramid of Menkaure (built for Pharaoh Menkaure).

Visitors can view the pyramids from inside the museum, which is designed in the shape of a chamfered triangle, echoing the geometry of the pyramids. The museum’s north and south walls are aligned with the Pyramid of Khufu and the Pyramid of Menkaure.

The design, created by the Irish architecture firm Heneghan Peng, uses sand-coloured concrete and translucent alabaster stone while the museum’s main facade is made of frosted glass panels.

The complex was announced in 1992, but construction did not begin until 2005 and was delayed by political turmoil after the 2011 Arab Spring and the COVID-19 pandemic. Some areas of the museum had a soft launch in 2024.

The museum complex includes the main building, a conference centre, a courtyard, a Nile Valley park, the Khufu Boat Museum and a conservation centre.

A look inside the museum

Upon entering the museum, visitors are greeted by the 3,200-year-old statue of King Ramses II, which weighs about 83 tonnes.

From 1954 to 2006, the statue stood in Ramses Square in front of Cairo’s main train station before being relocated to its new location near the museum. To facilitate the move, the statue was transported upright and in one piece on a specially designed 128-wheel vehicle, covering a distance of 30km (19 miles) and necessitating temporary road closures.

Beyond the entrance is the six-storey grand staircase, lined with about 60 artefacts, including statues that honour deities, sarcophagi that hold the deceased, columns showcasing ancient architectural artistry,, and stelae inscribed with significant texts.

The museum boasts 12 main permanent exhibition halls, which opened last year and are organised by both era (ranging from prehistory through the Greco-Roman period) and theme (including society, kingship and belief).

The Tutankhamun gallery

Among the museum’s most prominent and largest exhibition spaces is the Tutankhamun Gallery, a 7,500sq-metre (80,000sq-ft) space that features more than 5,000 artefacts unearthed from the tomb of Tutankhamun, the boy king who ascended to the throne at about nine years old and ruled during the Eighteenth Dynasty nearly 3,400 years ago.

Despite his brief reign, which ended with his unexpected death at about 18 or 19 years old, Tutankhamun is one of the most famous pharaohs, largely due to the discovery of his nearly intact tomb in 1922 in the Valley of the Kings on the west side of the Nile opposite the city of Luxor.

Visitors can see his golden mask, throne, sarcophagus, chariots and jewellery, all presented to re-create the atmosphere of his royal burial chamber.

One of the world’s largest museums

The Grand Egyptian Museum has about 45,000sq metres (484,000sq ft) of exhibition space, making it the sixth largest museum in the world by display area.

The Louvre in Paris tops the list with 72,735sq metres, followed by the State Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg, Russia (66,842sq metres), the National Museum of China in Beijing (65,000sq metres), the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City (58,820sq metres) and the Museo del Prado in Madrid, Spain (47,700sq metres).

Tourism is a major source of foreign currency for Egypt. In 2024, a record 15.7 million tourists visited Egypt, and the travel and tourism sector contributed roughly 8 percent of the country’s gross domestic product, according to official figures.",figurative
"Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow appears poised to return on Thanksgiving against the Ravens.

Cincinnati head coach Zac Taylor said today that he anticipates Burrow playing on Thursday night.

Burrow hasn’t played since suffering a toe injury in Week Two. The Bengals have gone 1-8 without him, although the quarterback position has been far from the Bengals’ only problem, as their defense has been a mess.

Realistically, no matter how well Burrow plays, it’s unlikely that the Bengals will be able to make the playoffs. Even if they run the table to go 9-8, they might not be a playoff team.

And running the table would be a tall order, as there are plenty of other injury issues in Cincinnati. Most notably, Taylor said today that wide receiver Tee Higgins will miss the Thanksgiving game with a concussion and defensive end Trey Hendrickson will miss the Thanksgiving game with a hip injury.",literal
"US government says designation is necessary to stem drugs flow, but observers believe Trump’s real goal is to oust Venezuela’s Maduro.

The United States government has designated what is known among Venezuelans as the “Cartel de los Soles” as a “terrorist organisation”, marking Washington’s latest effort to put pressure on President Nicolas Maduro as the US weighs up military action on land.

On November 16, the US Department of State declared that the Cartel de los Soles, or Cartel of the Suns, a term Venezuelans use to refer to officials engaged in corruption, would be added to the “foreign terrorist organization” (FTO) list from today. The US alleges the “cartel” is overseen by Maduro himself.

Speaking to One America News on Friday, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said the designation “brings a whole bunch of new options to the United States”, adding that Washington does not consider Maduro a legitimate leader.

While Washington claims Cartel de los Soles is overseen by the Venezuelan president and includes members of his inner circle, including in the military, Maduro denies any personal involvement in drug trafficking and even the existence of the alleged cartel.

In a statement responding to the move, Venezuela’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the action was a “ridiculous lie” used to justify future military intervention.

What is the Cartel de los Soles?

The US State Department alleges that the Cartel de los Soles, along with the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua criminal gang, is responsible for extensive drug-trafficking operations in the US and Europe.

According to the think tank InsightCrime, the name Cartel de los Soles emerged in the 1990s when Venezuelan generals and senior officers, who wore sun insignias on their epaulettes, were investigated for drug trafficking and related crimes.

Jeremy McDermott, codirector of InsightCrime, told CNN the cartel “is not a traditional, vertically organised drug-trafficking organisation. It is … a series of normally disconnected cells embedded within the Venezuelan military”.

Despite the allegations by President Donald Trump’s administration, the US Drug Enforcement Administration has never described the Cartel de los Soles as a drug-trafficking organisation in its annual National Drug Threat Assessment nor has the World Drug Report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.

What does the ‘terrorist’ designation mean?

There is no universally accepted definition of a drug cartel, but the term generally refers to a centrally controlled criminal organisation that operates across borders and uses violence to profit from illegal activities.

While the US Department of the Treasury has previously sanctioned the Cartel de los Soles, the new FTO designation gives the US government more powers to take action against it.

The designation criminalises all “support” for the Cartel de los Soles and bars its representatives from entering the US. As such, it is now a crime to provide funds to the group. And due to its alleged links with the military, that could potentially prevent foreign firms from doing business with the Venezuelan state.

The new classification also authorises diplomatic and financial penalties against the group, such as freezing its assets.

Crucially, the FTO designation bolsters the political and legal case for US military action in Venezuela, presenting an ostensible counternarcotics effort as part of a broader campaign for a change in government, analysts said.

Why has the US government taken this step?

The Trump administration has adopted an increasingly hard line towards Maduro, who claimed re-election in January despite accusations of fraud. Caracas banned Maduro’s main political rival, Maria Corina Machado, from running.

Washington, which has carried out a string of military strikes on Venezuelan boats it alleges are trafficking drugs in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, has not shared any evidence of Maduro’s direct involvement in drug trafficking. However, it continues to insist that the Venezuelan president is the head of the Cartel de los Soles and he is associated with Tren de Aragua.

In July, Trump’s national security adviser and secretary of state, Marco Rubio, accused Maduro of being “the leader of the designated narcoterrorist organisation Cartel de los Soles” and responsible for “trafficking drugs into the United States and Europe”.

In August, the US government raised its reward for information leading to Maduro’s arrest from $25m to $50m. But its characterisation of Maduro as a drug kingpin is seen by many – and by Maduro himself – as a way for the US to unseat him from power.

In October, Maduro accused the US of “fabricating a new war … [and] an extravagant narrative, a vulgar, criminal and totally fake one”. Maduro’s comments followed Trump’s announcement that he had authorised CIA operations in Venezuela.

Maduro said he believes Trump is aiming to reshape the political landscape in the Caribbean. If he falls, Maduro said, then US political foes in Cuba and Nicaragua could lose access to subsidised Venezuelan oil and could be destabilised.

What military action has the US taken?

Since September, the US has carried out a string of air strikes on what it says are drug-trafficking boats off the coasts of Venezuela and Colombia, amounting to the largest military deployment to the Caribbean in decades and killing at least 83 people.

Meanwhile, Washington has dispatched several warships, including the nuclear-powered super-carrier USS Gerald R Ford, the world’s largest and most advanced naval aircraft vessel, to the Caribbean Sea in recent weeks.

But Mark Cancian, a senior adviser to the defence and security programme at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, said the carrier is not designed for Trump’s mission, as described.

“The Ford is not well suited for counterdrug operations. … It’s well suited to attack adversaries either at sea or on land,” he posted in an analysis on X on November 14.

The show of force recalls a long history of military interventions and coup-mongering across Latin America by US governments, often motivated by fear of hostile powers close to US borders.

In recent decades, ties between Washington and Caracas have been dominated by tensions since the rise of Maduro’s left-wing predecessor Hugo Chavez. The relationship deteriorated further after Maduro came to power following Chavez’s death in 2013.

What will happen next?

Trump says he has “sort of” made up his mind about what to do in Venezuela but has not announced his decision yet.

Last week, when asked about the possibility of deploying US troops in Venezuela, Trump replied: “I don’t rule out that. I don’t rule out anything. We just have to take care of Venezuela.”

He told reporters on November 16 that “we may be having some discussions” with Maduro and “Venezuela wants to talk”, but he did not provide details.

Over the weekend, six international airlines suspended flights to Venezuela after the US warned carriers about a “potentially hazardous situation” in and around the country.",figurative
