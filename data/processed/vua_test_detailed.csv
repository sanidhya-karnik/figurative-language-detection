"Even for France, the variety to be found is enormous.",metaphor,10,2,0.2,VUA18,
"My passion is for its numerous Romanesque churches, in most cases humbly proportioned but elevated into unique works of art by the richness of their exquisitely-sculpted decoration; to go to Poitou/Saintonge and not look at any of its churches would be like going to an African game reserve and ignoring the animals.",metaphor,52,11,0.21153846153846154,VUA18,

"Now the Marais Poitevin is a pleasantly low-profile tourist attraction where you can take canal-boat trips from villages that have hardly changed in the 15-odd years I've known them: Maillezais, with a huge and rather dull ruined abbey, and Coulon, where I first ate the delicious local version of moules marinieres called mouclade.",metaphor,53,5,0.09433962264150944,VUA18,
"Drifting between grassy polders to which farmers have to ferry their cattle in punts, or following leafy twisting lanes marked only by rusty signs proclaiming the â Venise Verte, you're in an all-green, mysteriously silent world; only the occasional fisherman, twitching his rod above the algae-smothered waters, disturbs the stillness.",metaphor,50,10,0.2,VUA18,

"Saintes, with Gallo-Roman remains, a beautiful Romanesque abbey and an atmospheric medieval quarter, is 17 miles south of St Jean; 15-odd miles to the north-west is Surgeres, all of whose public buildings, including an engagingly asymmetrical church, are within the 16th-century castle walls, scattered among beautiful gardens and parkland â perfect for picnicking.",metaphor,53,1,0.018867924528301886,VUA18,

Explaining crime: theories of criminality,literal,5,0,0.0,VUA18,
Most people have their own notions or theories as to what causes criminal behaviour.,metaphor,14,1,0.07142857142857142,VUA18,
"For example, lack of discipline in the home, genetic defects, poverty, mixing with the â wrong sort have all been proposed as causes of criminality.",metaphor,25,2,0.08,VUA18,
"While such notions may all contains some elements of truth, they are by no means complete explanations of criminal behaviour.",metaphor,20,2,0.1,VUA18,
This chapter will examine a range of theories which attempt to explain such behaviour.,metaphor,14,4,0.2857142857142857,VUA18,
"Although the major theoretical explanations are covered in the numerous introductions to the sociology of crime and deviance and to sociology generally, some review of these theories is necessary before embarking upon an examination of specific, substantive examples of criminal behaviour.",metaphor,41,7,0.17073170731707318,VUA18,
"As this is not a book on criminological theories, what follows will be a brief overview of a wide range of theories and explanations.",metaphor,24,6,0.25,VUA18,
"It would be naive to expect to uncover any ultimate explanation or basic cause for criminal behaviour, given the extensive and diverse behaviour that is encompassed by the term crime.",metaphor,30,3,0.1,VUA18,
"Suppose, for example, that it could be proved that one cause of delinquency was lack of parental supervision.",literal,18,0,0.0,VUA18,
It might still be necessary to ask why delinquency occurred with one son or daughter but not another.,literal,18,0,0.0,VUA18,
"Also, there would be the further question of why the parents had not provided adequate supervision.",literal,16,0,0.0,VUA18,
Perhaps this was because of their poor living conditions which would raise the question of why they were in poor housing.,metaphor,21,5,0.23809523809523808,VUA18,
"Clearly, we are getting further and further away from the causes of delinquent behaviour, and it is perhaps wisest to think in terms of causal processes when looking at criminal behaviour.",metaphor,31,8,0.25806451612903225,VUA18,
"Before examining the major sociological on crime, it is useful to refer to theories from outside of sociology, from other academic disciplines.",metaphor,22,6,0.2727272727272727,VUA18,
"Thus, we will look initially at biological and psychological theories.",metaphor,10,2,0.2,VUA18,
Biological( or physiological) explanations are based on the notion that some individuals are predisposed to criminal behaviour because of their genetic make-up.,metaphor,22,4,0.18181818181818182,VUA18,
"The individual criminal is born so; and this is usually put down to â faulty chromosome patterns, or, more vaguely, to â hereditary traits.",metaphor,24,6,0.25,VUA18,
"In his book L'Uomo Delinquente, Lombroso developed a complex description of what he called the â born criminal, who could be recognised by a variety of physical characteristics, in particular facial characteristics â for example large jaws and ears, and high cheek bones.",metaphor,43,3,0.06976744186046512,VUA18,
In the medical faculty at the University of Rome there is a gallery of portraits of splendidly ugly delinquents who were used to illustrate Lombroso's theory.,metaphor,26,1,0.038461538461538464,VUA18,
To use his own language:,literal,5,0,0.0,VUA18,
"Thus were explained anatomically the enormous jaws, high cheek bones, prominent superciliary arches, solitary lines on the palms, extreme size of the orbits, handle-shaped or sessile ears found in criminals, savages and apes, insensibility of pain, extremely acute sight, tattooing, excessive idleness, love of orgies and the craving for evil for its own sake â¦",metaphor,55,9,0.16363636363636364,VUA18,
These explanations see the delinquent individual as inherently more prone to criminal behaviour than the non-delinquent.,metaphor,16,4,0.25,VUA18,
They have been widely criticised and rejected by sociologists.,literal,9,0,0.0,VUA18,
"Lombroso's work, for example, was based on his examination of people in prison in Italy.",metaphor,15,2,0.13333333333333333,VUA18,
"This would, necessarily, ignore the fact that many criminals do not go to prison, and that, perhaps, people in prison are not always criminal.",metaphor,24,2,0.08333333333333333,VUA18,
"Most advocates of biological theories do not express themselves in the same bizarre language and style as Lombroso, and such theories of crime are not merely historical relics that died with Lombroso.",metaphor,32,6,0.1875,VUA18,
"In a major study of institutionalised delinquents( delinquents in some form of custody) in the USA in the 1950s, Sheldon and Eleanor Glueck found that delinquent boys were twice as likely to have a mesomorphic build, a chunky, muscular, compared with non-delinquent boys.",metaphor,43,6,0.13953488372093023,VUA18,
"However, the fact that the study was restricted to institutionalised delinquents limits the validity of the association between body build and crime and delinquency.",metaphor,24,4,0.16666666666666666,VUA18,
It may be that tougher-looking delinquents are more liable to be put away than fragile looking ones.,metaphor,17,5,0.29411764705882354,VUA18,
"Furthermore, it has been found that the association between delinquency on the one hand and height, weight and physique on the other is greatly reduced once social, background factors are taken into account.",metaphor,33,12,0.36363636363636365,VUA18,
"For example, lower working-class people are more likely to be mesomorphic as a result of their diet and continual manual labour, and this class grouping is more likely to be found represented in the criminal statistics.",metaphor,36,4,0.1111111111111111,VUA18,
"With regard to the links between criminal behaviour and inherited characteristics, there have been a number of theoretical explanations suggesting an association between criminality and particular personality characteristics.",metaphor,28,6,0.21428571428571427,VUA18,
"An example of this more sophisticated biological approach is the work of Hans Eysenck, who has argued in a series of studies, that there is a link between genetically based personality characteristics and criminal behaviour.",metaphor,35,6,0.17142857142857143,VUA18,
He maintains that there is a link between characteristics such as extroversion and criminal behaviour.,metaphor,15,3,0.2,VUA18,
"An individual's degree of extroversion or introversion is inherited, determined by his or her genetic make-up.",metaphor,16,4,0.25,VUA18,
"The link with crime found by Eysenck was that when prisoners were tested for extroversion, more extroverts were found than in the general population.",metaphor,24,5,0.20833333333333334,VUA18,
Eysenck then argues that extroversion is the inherited basis of criminal behaviour.,metaphor,12,1,0.08333333333333333,VUA18,
"Extroverts take longer to learn the rules of society, they are more likely to break them, and thus more likely become convicted criminals.",metaphor,23,4,0.17391304347826086,VUA18,
"As with Lombroso's work and the Gluecks' study discussed above, by starting with institutionalised criminals, it is assumed that all prisoners are criminals and that most criminals do, in fact, go to prison.",metaphor,33,5,0.15151515151515152,VUA18,
The people who get caught and imprisoned may not be a representative picture of all criminals.,metaphor,16,1,0.0625,VUA18,
The major problem faced by theories suggesting a link between genetic make-up and criminal behaviour is the difficulty of distinguishing between genetic and environmental effects.,metaphor,25,6,0.24,VUA18,
"While some genetic influence can not be ruled out, just what is inherited remains very unclear.",metaphor,16,1,0.0625,VUA18,
These theories share certain similarities with biological explanations.,metaphor,8,3,0.375,VUA18,
They stress the link between criminal behaviour and specific personality traits or characteristics.,metaphor,13,3,0.23076923076923078,VUA18,
"Psychological theories, however, see these characteristics as a result of unusual or abnormal experiences, rather than as inherited.",metaphor,18,3,0.16666666666666666,VUA18,
"Thus, as with biological theories, crime is seen as pathological( a disease), as something to be looked at from the medical point of view.",metaphor,24,7,0.2916666666666667,VUA18,
"However, psychological causes are seen as treatable, whereas biological causes mark the individual for life.",metaphor,15,1,0.06666666666666667,VUA18,
"In those cases there is no possible treatment, one is born a criminal.",metaphor,13,2,0.15384615384615385,VUA18,
"Many psychological theories refer to faulty parent-child relationships, such as abnormal experiences in early childhood having a lasting effect and influence on personality.",metaphor,23,5,0.21739130434782608,VUA18,
"Studies in this area have indicated that too strict or too lax parental attitudes increase the risk of delinquency( the work of John Bowlby, for example); they have found that if a young child is deprived of close personal relationships with parents or parent figures then â problem behaviour is more common.",metaphor,52,9,0.17307692307692307,VUA18,
"It is well established that in the delinquent-prone, home discipline is more liable to be too lax, strict or erratic.",metaphor,20,2,0.1,VUA18,
"However, it is patently obvious that parents can be a good or bad influence and example for their children, and this fact can hardly be used to explain present patterns of crime.",metaphor,32,3,0.09375,VUA18,
"The majority of offenders do not come from disturbed or broken homes, and many broken homes do not produce delinquents.",metaphor,20,4,0.2,VUA18,
"Of course, this last point does not show that there is no link between parent-child relations and crime and delinquency.",metaphor,20,5,0.25,VUA18,
"The problem with assessing the influence of parental and family dimensions, such as weak supervision or parental criminality, is the fact that they are closely linked to various aspects of social and economic disadvantage, such as poverty, overcrowding and poor housing.",metaphor,41,9,0.21951219512195122,VUA18,
"And it may be that these disadvantages help to cause parental difficulties, and hamper good parenting.",metaphor,16,2,0.125,VUA18,
"We can hardly do justice to the wide scope of psychological theories here, but there are some basic ideas and assumptions which underlie such theorizing.",metaphor,25,3,0.12,VUA18,
"These stress the importance of family relationships and upbringing during the early years, and conclude that anti-social, and by implication criminal, behaviour results from faulty personality development.",metaphor,27,4,0.14814814814814814,VUA18,
"To summarise, these biological and psychological theories hold that the criminal is a particular type of person, apart from the rest of society and with a special predisposition toward criminal behaviour.",metaphor,31,5,0.16129032258064516,VUA18,
"They are based on the idea that criminal behaviour is either inherited or a consequence of unique, individual experiences.",metaphor,19,3,0.15789473684210525,VUA18,
"Before we look at sociological explanations it might be useful to ask yourself, or to discuss with colleagues, whether you feel that criminals are different â types of person.",metaphor,29,3,0.10344827586206896,VUA18,
"While there are, no doubt, predispositions toward criminal behaviour, and clearly certain characteristics are inherited, most sociologists would reject these â individual pathology sort of theories.",metaphor,26,3,0.11538461538461539,VUA18,
They lack convincing supporting evidence.,metaphor,5,1,0.2,VUA18,
While some offenders suffer from mental disorders the vast majority do not.,metaphor,12,2,0.16666666666666666,VUA18,
"Furthermore, if criminals are abnormal then it follows that a large proportion of the population must also be abnormal.",metaphor,19,2,0.10526315789473684,VUA18,
"For numerous studies have shown that a high percentage of the population have committed criminal offences, in particular high proportions of juveniles, and it is difficult to believe that they are all different or abnormal.",metaphor,35,4,0.11428571428571428,VUA18,
We said above that sociologists would reject non-sociological explanations of crime.,metaphor,11,1,0.09090909090909091,VUA18,
"In Chapter One, it was stressed that crime can not be considered aside from its social context, that it is dependent on society defining certain actions as criminal, and on the reaction of others to such actions.",metaphor,37,8,0.21621621621621623,VUA18,
A Model to Link Personality Characteristics to a Preference for Science,metaphor,11,3,0.2727272727272727,VUA18,
In recent years there has been a steady accumulation of evidence that personality and allied affective factors play a crucial role in determining subject choice and student success.,metaphor,28,6,0.21428571428571427,VUA18,
"Unfortunately, this evidence has tended to be fragmentary, a collection of separate, discrete pieces of information lacking a synthesizing theory to provide cohesion and predictive power.",metaphor,26,6,0.23076923076923078,VUA18,
The few models which have been developed to date may have been correct as far as they go but are clearly incomplete.,metaphor,22,4,0.18181818181818182,VUA18,
"For example Roe( 1952), Eiduson( 1962) and McClelland( 1962) suggested that male scientists often experienced a lonely childhood, perhaps suffering social isolation through illness or family circumstances, so that they developed a strong interest in their surrounding material world and a below average interest in other people and relationships.",metaphor,49,9,0.1836734693877551,VUA18,
Maslow( 1966) and Hudson( 1966 and 1968) saw science as providing an emotionally undemanding activity appealing to boys moving from the calm of latency to the turbulence of adolescence.,metaphor,29,8,0.27586206896551724,VUA18,
"Even if these descriptions are valid they still leave open a number of questions, particularly why the same mechanisms do not operate with girls.",metaphor,24,7,0.2916666666666667,VUA18,
Arising from the evidence in the literature and from our empirical studies at Chelsea College it is now possible to offer a model which is compatible with all the evidence and which also has considerable predictive potential.,metaphor,37,7,0.1891891891891892,VUA18,
What we know about persons choosing science,metaphor,7,1,0.14285714285714285,VUA18,
The evidence for an association between personality characteristics and an interest in science has been more fully reviewed by Head( 1979).,metaphor,21,4,0.19047619047619047,VUA18,
We need now only take note of the most salient features.,metaphor,11,3,0.2727272727272727,VUA18,
"The predominance of males, particularly in the physical sciences and engineering, throughout the Western world can no longer be satisfactorily attributed to cognitive differences, which are too small, nor to institutional factors.",metaphor,32,5,0.15625,VUA18,
Equal opportunity in education and employment has not made science any more popular with women.,metaphor,15,3,0.2,VUA18,
"Furthermore, the characteristics of those students who do opt for science show clear sex differences.",metaphor,15,3,0.2,VUA18,
"Male scientists, both science students and mature, professional scientists, tend to be emotionally reticent, disliking overt emotional expression in others and themselves, and depending upon their partners in personal relationships to take the emotional initiatives.",metaphor,35,5,0.14285714285714285,VUA18,
"They will also tend to be authoritarian, conservative and controlled in their thinking.",metaphor,13,1,0.07692307692307693,VUA18,
These differences can be seen quite early on; we have found boys aged 14 years who were opting for science to be significantly more authoritarian than their peers.,metaphor,28,4,0.14285714285714285,VUA18,
"Girls choosing science are not particularly emotionally reticent or rigid in their thinking, although they do seem to have low self-esteem in terms of being socially and sexually attractive.",metaphor,29,4,0.13793103448275862,VUA18,
We also know that at about the age of 13 a very high proportion of boys are attracted to science and scientific careers.,metaphor,23,6,0.2608695652173913,VUA18,
"Thereafter, there is a steady decline of interest in science and this disillusionment extends right through the secondary-school years and into the undergraduate period.",metaphor,24,7,0.2916666666666667,VUA18,
"In contrast, only a minority of girls express an interest in science at any age but there is no obvious swing from science in the middle and late teens.",metaphor,29,10,0.3448275862068966,VUA18,
Some further evidence has come from our use of sentence completion tests with secondary-school pupils as part of our research programme at Chelsea.,metaphor,23,5,0.21739130434782608,VUA18,
Analysis of these responses provides further information on sex differences and between those opting for different subjects.,metaphor,17,6,0.35294117647058826,VUA18,
"For example, girls at the age of 12 and 14 years seem to take a more mature attitude to personal relationships, seeing their complexity and reciprocal nature, while boys are more exploitative.",metaphor,32,7,0.21875,VUA18,
"In relation to the sentence stem â A girl and her mother â¦, girls often produce responses like â often go through a bad patch for a year but once they learn to understand each other, become the best of friends or â can help each other with their problems.",metaphor,50,7,0.14,VUA18,
"Similar questions, when asked of boys, tend to produce banal responses or exploitative ones, for example the parent is seen as the source of money.",metaphor,25,3,0.12,VUA18,
"In contrast, boys seem to have a firmer self-identity and a clearer ambition showing more insight in response to sentence stems such as â My main problem is â¦ and â He/she felt proud that â¦.",metaphor,36,8,0.2222222222222222,VUA18,
Such findings give us some clues about the characteristics of boys and girls of these ages.,metaphor,16,3,0.1875,VUA18,
"If we compare boys of 14 years of age who opt for science with other boys, we find that the former have very cut-and-dried views on many issues.",metaphor,28,5,0.17857142857142858,VUA18,
"For example, they take the view that â criminals should be severely punished or that â anyone who is unpopular deserves his fate.",metaphor,23,2,0.08695652173913043,VUA18,
"To the sentence stem â When a child will not join in group activities â¦, these boys gave responses like â he is selfish, â he must be stupid, â he deserves to be unpopular.",metaphor,35,6,0.17142857142857143,VUA18,
"In contrast, other boys and most girls pondered the possible causes and ways of integrating the child into the group.",metaphor,20,4,0.2,VUA18,
"The science boys seemed to possess few doubts or uncertainties, they offered clear-cut answers.",metaphor,14,1,0.07142857142857142,VUA18,
It was this evidence which suggested the possible model for subject choice in terms of ego-identity achievement.,metaphor,17,4,0.23529411764705882,VUA18,
This model was originally postulated by Erikson( 1965) and then developed by Marcia( 1966 and 1976).,metaphor,16,2,0.125,VUA18,
Erikson suggests that at different phases of life an individual faces a particular psycho-social problem which needs to be resolved before moving on to the next phase.,metaphor,27,10,0.37037037037037035,VUA18,
"By the end of adolescence he or she needs to make choices about career, life-style, personal relationships and ideologies.",metaphor,19,4,0.21052631578947367,VUA18,
The ego-identity of that person is shaped by these choices.,metaphor,10,3,0.3,VUA18,
Erikson does not suggest that the development of an ego-identity is a once-and-for-all issue.,literal,14,0,0.0,VUA18,
"Some problems about identity arise with the young child in the context of home and school, and others occur in later life, for example on retirement.",metaphor,26,7,0.2692307692307692,VUA18,
"Nevertheless, adolescence is the time when ego-identity development inevitably dominates the personal development of the individual for a while.",metaphor,19,1,0.05263157894736842,VUA18,
"The adolescent does not, however, need to achieve a clear ego-identity on all topics at one time.",metaphor,17,3,0.17647058823529413,VUA18,
In this article we are concerned with ego-identity achievement in respect to career.,metaphor,13,5,0.38461538461538464,VUA18,
"Marcia has put more detail onto the Erikson model and suggests that in going from the initial ego-diffusion condition to that of having achieved ego-identity, two processes are involved: crisis and commitment.",metaphor,32,12,0.375,VUA18,
Crisis in this context describes a period of intensive self-examination in which one's beliefs and values are re-examined.,metaphor,18,8,0.4444444444444444,VUA18,
Commitment means that the individual has acquired clear and firm beliefs both about himself or herself and the world.,metaphor,19,6,0.3157894736842105,VUA18,
Figure 16.1 indicates a number of possible routes to ego-identity achievements.,metaphor,11,3,0.2727272727272727,VUA18,
"A person may undergo crisis and commitment simultaneously and progress by route A. An alternative is to undergo a period of considerable self-doubt and self-examination in which all one's beliefs tend to be very fluid, a period known as moratorium, before acquiring beliefs for oneself and ego-identity is achieved( route B).",metaphor,51,9,0.17647058823529413,VUA18,
"A further possibility is that the individual may, at least for a time, hold onto beliefs and values taken without question from others, for example parents, teachers, peers.",metaphor,28,6,0.21428571428571427,VUA18,
This condition is known as foreclosure.,metaphor,6,3,0.5,VUA18,
"Eventually these persons might have to face up to period of crisis, of self-examination, and so achieve ego-identity by route C. However, foreclosure does offer an escape route and an individual might postpone indefinitely any real self-examination by clinging rigidly to his or her beliefs and values( route D).",metaphor,49,14,0.2857142857142857,VUA18,
We can now make the link between this model of adolescent development and subject choice in schools.,metaphor,17,7,0.4117647058823529,VUA18,
"The physical sciences in particular, offer a conventional career choice which is likely to win approval from parents, teachers and peers.",metaphor,21,3,0.14285714285714285,VUA18,

We can consider three possible changes:,metaphor,6,2,0.3333333333333333,VUA18,
Delaying subject choice: Britain is unusual in asking pupils to make crucial choices about subject options in the 13â16 age range.,metaphor,21,8,0.38095238095238093,VUA18,
These decisions can only be reversed with great difficulty.,metaphor,9,4,0.4444444444444444,VUA18,
What effect would delaying the choice make?,metaphor,7,1,0.14285714285714285,VUA18,
"In the development through the years of adolescence the number of foreclosure pupils will diminish, hence the recruitment of boys into science would be cut.",metaphor,25,6,0.24,VUA18,

"Overall there would be a reduction in the number of students choosing science, but those who do so choose will be more likely to stay happily in the subject and to possess more flexible minds.",metaphor,35,7,0.2,VUA18,
The quantitative loss would be met by a qualitative improvement.,metaphor,10,1,0.1,VUA18,
"Giving science a more feminine image: It is sometimes argued that science textbooks are sexist in showing illustrations of boys, rather than girls, doing practical work in the laboratory, and so forth.",metaphor,32,4,0.125,VUA18,
What effect would a deliberate attempt to change this image have?,metaphor,11,4,0.36363636363636365,VUA18,

"The survey of children's attitudes helped here: research such as Ormerod's( 1971; Ormerod and Duckworth, 1975) had shown that girls were interested in the social implications of science, but did not tell teachers what the desirable teaching approach might be in practice.",metaphor,42,8,0.19047619047619047,VUA18,

"At present the science curriculum is structured around physical science interests, on which boys are keener( how motor cars work, atoms and molecules); we were able to recommend that teaching build on the overlapping interests of the two sexes, because girls as well as boys want to know more about human biology and spectacular features of the environment( animals in the jungle, volcanoes and earthquakes, acids and chemicals).",metaphor,68,12,0.17647058823529413,VUA18,

"First, the pupils, teachers and practitioners of science are overwhelmingly male in terms of numbers; second, school science is packaged and presented to appeal to boys, not girls; third, classroom behaviours and interaction operate to reconstruct science as a male activity, and finally it has been suggested that â scientific thinking embodies an intrinsically masculine world view.",metaphor,57,9,0.15789473684210525,VUA18,
"The GIST interventions described above relate to three of these: VISTA women, albeit briefly and temporarily, redressed the numerical balance by offering female role models of practising scientists; VISTA and the curriculum development which followed involved a limited â repackaging of science to remove its exclusively masculine appeal, and the single-sex classes and classroom observation showed how science comes to be defined as â masculine in the mixed school.",metaphor,69,11,0.15942028985507245,VUA18,

"If by 1945 Merleau-ponty had here already indicated the historical basis for what was to become Sartre's project in the Critique, the theoretical problem that followed was how to unite orthodox Marxist concepts of economic determinism and historical necessity with the individualism of Sartre's earlier work, that is the existentialist notion of the authentic self and the possibility of choosing one's own freedom: how to relocate human practice within historical determinism, to reconcile the individual with the social, the idea of agency with that of necessity, or freedom with history?",metaphor,90,15,0.16666666666666666,VUA18,

"It is therefore, Sartre argues, our historical task to make it known, promoting not just the historical process as such, but also the general recognition whereby the plurality of the meanings of individual histories can be seen to combine to make one history, with one meaning â the â Truth of humanity( I, 822).",metaphor,54,6,0.1111111111111111,VUA18,

"In the context of the negativity of this formulation, Sartre is obliged to pose once again the problem of whether there can be a totalization, without any independent totalizer or totalizing force such as the dialectic, or whether the structure of negation that he has described means that, as for Adorno or Bakhtin, history does not develop positively but, rather, negatively, and is therefore instead detotalizing:",metaphor,66,9,0.13636363636363635,VUA18,

perhaps the Truth of History can not be proved; its direction can not be discerned.,metaphor,15,2,0.13333333333333333,VUA18,
"Sartre's reaction to the threat that the negation of a negation may produce a detotalizing effect is to introduce a new category, a unifying force of a â singularization which incarnates the universal: â If totalization really is an ongoing process, he writes, â then it operates everywhere.",metaphor,48,10,0.20833333333333334,VUA18,

"Unlike Luk¡cs' insignificant event from which the universal is precariously drawn out through the narrative, Sartre's singularity works synecdochally in a conventional antinomy with the universal, the relation between the two structured according to the familiar nineteenth-century model of organic growth or process in which each singular event makes up the whole while, as he puts it, â the whole is entirely present in the part as its present meaning and as its destiny.",metaphor,74,21,0.28378378378378377,VUA18,

"That developing process is itself totalized through Sartre's assertion that each totalization is the totalization of all struggles, as it must be if the singular is to incarnate the universal.",metaphor,30,5,0.16666666666666666,VUA18,
The concept of the singular universal thus facilitates a circularity in the argument whereby Sartre can avoid the question which he began by posing.,metaphor,24,2,0.08333333333333333,VUA18,

"This strategy marks a structure of repetition in Sartre's text: each time he poses the question of how there can be totalization of History without a totalizer, he retreats to a more limited example whose unity is already evident, but which in the end only brings him back to the original question again.",metaphor,53,13,0.24528301886792453,VUA18,
"In this case Sartre demonstrates how the singular universal works, by appealing to the concrete example of a boxing match â a random exemplification that just happens to reproduce the single adversaries of the master/slave dialectic.",metaphor,36,9,0.25,VUA18,

"Since it can not be known as a concept that will realize itself in the future, Sartre argues instead that the totality only produces itself in the moment: â The incarnation as such is at once unrealizable except as totalization of everything and irreducible to a pure abstract unity of that which it totalizes( II, 58).",metaphor,56,9,0.16071428571428573,VUA18,

"At the same time Sartre makes a larger, though less persuasive claim that the boxing-match also works synecdochally and re-exteriorizes a more fundamental violence, namely the interiorized condition of scarcity that he considers to be the basis of conflict in general.",metaphor,41,5,0.12195121951219512,VUA18,
"The boxing match â is the public incarnation of all conflict( II, 32), totalizing in its own struggle the whole of â contemporary irreducibilities and fissures( II, 26):",metaphor,28,4,0.14285714285714285,VUA18,
"thus one can and must say â¦ that each fight is the singularisation of all the circumstances of the social whole in movement and that by this singularisation, it incarnates the enveloping totalization which the historical process is.",metaphor,38,5,0.13157894736842105,VUA18,

"So, although it is possible to conceive of any event as an incarnation of the totality, insofar as it must itself make up a part of that totality in its determination, unlike the case of the boxing match, where we can define the overall entity â boxing, it still remains unproven that an overall entity, â History, can be said to exist at all.",metaphor,64,9,0.140625,VUA18,

"It is simple enough for him to show that a boxing match takes place within a general totality of â boxing, which is itself only ever present in any individual incarnation, for as a game each match is both an individual bout and something conducted according to general rules and a specific social tradition.",metaphor,54,7,0.12962962962962962,VUA18,
"But what about those conflicts that do not take place within such a constituted social system, such as conflictual bourgeois societies which can not be said to be unified, except, as Sartre suggests dismissively, by appeal to a lost paradise before the class struggle?",metaphor,44,12,0.2727272727272727,VUA18,

Once again he backtracks and assumes a larger unity in which conflict takes place.,metaphor,14,5,0.35714285714285715,VUA18,
"The major question thus always remains unanswered in the Critique: every time that Sartre announces that he is about to proceed with the fundamental problem of how History can be a totalization without a totalizer, he turns back to a previous, more easily intelligible stage on the way.",metaphor,48,12,0.25,VUA18,

"Where the end is person- rather than role-oriented â that is, where the end is the development of the human mind and spirit rather than the production of, say, information technologists â then education is valued in relation to some conception of worthwhile human existence which it is meant to serve.",metaphor,51,9,0.17647058823529413,VUA18,

"Yet because the philosopher's adult has traditionally been male, his children boy children, and his educational programmes designed to facilitate the transition between them, the ideal of the fully human person has been masculinised to the point where otherwise thoughtful and sometimes good and wise men have unashamedly admitted that this defining ideal is not applicable to half the species.",metaphor,60,9,0.15,VUA18,

"The degeneration occurs, not because men are congenitally or even incorrigibly narrow, libertine, isolated or selfish, but because in defining themselves as autonomous beings in opposition to other human beings they have had to seek what separates them as a group from others.",metaphor,43,12,0.27906976744186046,VUA18,
It is a curiously paradoxical foundation uponupon which to build a theory of autonomy.,metaphor,14,4,0.2857142857142857,VUA18,

When philosophers dismiss women as â not-men they frequently do more than simply lump them together with children or lunatics.,metaphor,20,3,0.15,VUA18,

We can do more than to reject such descriptions of ourselves; we can ask further questions: are children like this? is this why children are not autonomous?,metaphor,27,3,0.1111111111111111,VUA18,
"Again, women well know what it is like to be treated as children and they find it offensive.",metaphor,18,2,0.1111111111111111,VUA18,

"The assumption that all groups in the â not-men class are identical with each other is so firmly rooted that, as we shall see in the fourth section, it is readily assumed even by modern libertarian thinkers that showing that, for example, some ground for distinguishing between men and women is false or irrelevant, immediately commits us to the view that the same ground is irrelevant in distinguishing men from children.",metaphor,71,20,0.28169014084507044,VUA18,

"Sharing a small spartan room with two other girls — Northerners whose accent Paula found almost incomprehensible and with whom she had nothing in common , making breakfast in the communal kitchen , queuing for the bath , adhering to a strict curfew after which time the doors were locked and bolted — none of these were restrictions Paula had the slightest intention of enduring for long .",metaphor,33,4,0.12121212121212122,VUA20,
"And at least she was in London , centre of the British fashion industry .",metaphor,6,2,0.3333333333333333,VUA20,
"As for the House of Mattli , it might have been in a different world to the hostel , with its air of being a cross between a workhouse and a boarding school .",metaphor,10,6,0.6,VUA20,
The first time she rang the bell and went in through the front doors of the elegant old house where the showrooms were situated ( Mattli had no rear entrance ) Paula felt she was stepping into the place of her dreams .,metaphor,20,1,0.05,VUA20,
"Deep carpet covered the floors and the stairs swept up to the showrooms and the warren of workrooms beyond , and though the window drapes and furnishings were ever-so-slightly faded , as if they had seen better days , they were of the finest silks and velvets and every corner was swept , polished and cleaned daily so that no single speck of dust , let alone a cobweb , dared show itself .",metaphor,33,7,0.21212121212121213,VUA20,
"The showroom was neither large nor small , decorated in muted shades of aubergine which would not detract from the clothes .",metaphor,9,1,0.1111111111111111,VUA20,
There was a low table and three or four dainty chairs with aubergine velvet seats and gilded spindle legs .,metaphor,10,1,0.1,VUA20,
"The crystal chandelier was for effect only — lighting that would show off the clothes to their best advantage was brilliant yet discreet , and along one wall were racks holding some of the ready-to-wear garments .",metaphor,16,1,0.0625,VUA20,
In contrast to this elegant frontage the workrooms beyond were a hive of frenzied activity .,metaphor,7,1,0.14285714285714285,VUA20,
"Pattern cutters , fitters , sewing hands and their assistants all worked at an incredible speed .",literal,9,0,0.0,VUA20,
"This , Paula soon discovered , was the way of the fashion world — a constant frantic rush against the clock , to have collections ready on time or to complete individual couture garments for customers who always considered their order more urgent , more important , than that of anyone else .",metaphor,25,6,0.24,VUA20,
Paula was amazed by the security arrangements that were necessary to ensure that the new season 's collections remained exclusive — the windows at the rear of the premises were heavily barred and practically the first thing she had to do on commencing her employment was to sign a contract promising that she would not breathe a word about the designs she saw .,metaphor,28,3,0.10714285714285714,VUA20,
On her second day Madame Mattli took her to Vidal Sassoon 's salon in Grosvenor House so that her hair could be cut in an up-to-the-minute style .,literal,14,0,0.0,VUA20,
Unlike some couturiers Madame did not mind if her model girls did not have the same colour hair but she did insist on identical styles .,metaphor,10,1,0.1,VUA20,

This was her very first taste of only the best being good enough — and she liked it !,metaphor,6,1,0.16666666666666666,VUA20,

Paula was not very clever with her needle but she soon learned to be careful so as not to incur the wrath of the seamstress .,literal,9,0,0.0,VUA20,
"There were new tricks of modelling to be learned too — how to remove a coat , sliding It carefully off her shoulders with the sleeves hanging in perfect balance , never for one moment allowing the inside to be on view , for samples were often unlined .",metaphor,21,1,0.047619047619047616,VUA20,

Although she enjoyed her job Paula was lonely .,literal,4,0,0.0,VUA20,
Even the most popular of girls soon discovered that in this highly competitive world where models vied with one another for the most glamorous jobs and the wealthiest and best-looking men there was far more bitchiness than in the provinces — and Paula was far from popular .,metaphor,21,2,0.09523809523809523,VUA20,
The other girls disliked her for her outstanding looks and her haughty ways and made no attempt to be friendly on anything but the most superficial level and the pattern cutters and sewing hands hurried home to their families and boyfriends the moment they finished their long day 's work .,metaphor,25,4,0.16,VUA20,
"Paula spent most of her free time alone , window shopping , visiting News Theatres , where she sometimes watched the programme of cartoons twice round , and drinking endless cups of Espresso coffee in cafés and coffee houses .",metaphor,23,3,0.13043478260869565,VUA20,

PART 2 Sociology and crime,literal,3,0,0.0,VUA20,
Explaining crime : theories of criminality,literal,4,0,0.0,VUA20,
Most people have their own notions or theories as to what causes criminal behaviour .,literal,6,0,0.0,VUA20,
"For example , lack of discipline in the home , genetic defects , poverty , mixing with the ‘ wrong sort ’ have all been proposed as causes of criminality .",metaphor,13,1,0.07692307692307693,VUA20,
"While such notions may all contains some elements of truth , they are by no means complete explanations of criminal behaviour .",metaphor,9,2,0.2222222222222222,VUA20,
This chapter will examine a range of theories which attempt to explain such behaviour .,metaphor,7,3,0.42857142857142855,VUA20,
"Although the major theoretical explanations are covered in the numerous introductions to the sociology of crime and deviance and to sociology generally , some review of these theories is necessary before embarking upon an examination of specific , substantive examples of criminal behaviour .",metaphor,21,3,0.14285714285714285,VUA20,
"As this is not a book on criminological theories , what follows will be a brief overview of a wide range of theories and explanations .",metaphor,10,4,0.4,VUA20,
"First , a word of warning might be in order .",metaphor,4,1,0.25,VUA20,
"It would be naive to expect to uncover any ultimate explanation or basic cause for criminal behaviour , given the extensive and diverse behaviour that is encompassed by the term crime .",metaphor,16,3,0.1875,VUA20,
"Suppose , for example , that it could be proved that one cause of delinquency was lack of parental supervision .",literal,8,0,0.0,VUA20,
It might still be necessary to ask why delinquency occurred with one son or daughter but not another .,literal,7,0,0.0,VUA20,
"Also , there would be the further question of why the parents had not provided adequate supervision .",literal,6,0,0.0,VUA20,
Perhaps this was because of their poor living conditions which would raise the question of why they were in poor housing .,metaphor,8,3,0.375,VUA20,
Was this because of governmental housing policy or a poor employment record on the part of the bread-winner of the family ?,metaphor,9,1,0.1111111111111111,VUA20,
"Clearly , we are getting further and further away from the causes of delinquent behaviour , and it is perhaps wisest to think in terms of causal processes when looking at criminal behaviour .",metaphor,15,4,0.26666666666666666,VUA20,
Biological and psychological theories,literal,3,0,0.0,VUA20,
"Before examining the major sociological on crime , it is useful to refer to theories from outside of sociology , from other academic disciplines .",metaphor,11,1,0.09090909090909091,VUA20,
"Thus , we will look initially at biological and psychological theories .",metaphor,6,1,0.16666666666666666,VUA20,
Biological theories,literal,2,0,0.0,VUA20,
Biological ( or physiological ) explanations are based on the notion that some individuals are predisposed to criminal behaviour because of their genetic make-up .,metaphor,11,2,0.18181818181818182,VUA20,
"The individual criminal is born so ; and this is usually put down to ‘ faulty chromosome patterns ’ , or , more vaguely , to ‘ hereditary traits ’ .",metaphor,11,3,0.2727272727272727,VUA20,
"The most famous exponent of this approach was the nineteenth-century Italian physician , Cesare Lombroso .",metaphor,8,1,0.125,VUA20,
"In his book L'Uomo Delinquente , Lombroso developed a complex description of what he called the ‘ born criminal ’ , who could be recognised by a variety of physical characteristics , in particular facial characteristics — for example large jaws and ears , and high cheek bones .",metaphor,23,1,0.043478260869565216,VUA20,
In the medical faculty at the University of Rome there is a gallery of portraits of splendidly ugly delinquents who were used to illustrate Lombroso 's theory .,metaphor,13,1,0.07692307692307693,VUA20,
To use his own language :,literal,2,0,0.0,VUA20,
"Thus were explained anatomically the enormous jaws , high cheek bones , prominent superciliary arches , solitary lines on the palms , extreme size of the orbits , handle-shaped or sessile ears found in criminals , savages and apes , insensibility of pain , extremely acute sight , tattooing , excessive idleness , love of orgies and the craving for evil for its own sake …",metaphor,37,8,0.21621621621621623,VUA20,
These explanations see the delinquent individual as inherently more prone to criminal behaviour than the non-delinquent .,metaphor,9,2,0.2222222222222222,VUA20,
They have been widely criticised and rejected by sociologists .,literal,4,0,0.0,VUA20,
"Lombroso 's work , for example , was based on his examination of people in prison in Italy .",metaphor,8,1,0.125,VUA20,
"This would , necessarily , ignore the fact that many criminals do not go to prison , and that , perhaps , people in prison are not always criminal .",metaphor,12,1,0.08333333333333333,VUA20,
"Most advocates of biological theories do not express themselves in the same bizarre language and style as Lombroso , and such theories of crime are not merely historical relics that died with Lombroso .",metaphor,15,4,0.26666666666666666,VUA20,
"In a major study of institutionalised delinquents ( delinquents in some form of custody ) in the USA in the 1950s , Sheldon and Eleanor Glueck found that delinquent boys were twice as likely to have a mesomorphic build , a chunky , muscular , compared with non-delinquent boys .",metaphor,23,2,0.08695652173913043,VUA20,
"However , the fact that the study was restricted to institutionalised delinquents limits the validity of the association between body build and crime and delinquency .",metaphor,13,2,0.15384615384615385,VUA20,
It may be that tougher-looking delinquents are more liable to be put away than fragile looking ones .,metaphor,8,4,0.5,VUA20,
"Furthermore , it has been found that the association between delinquency on the one hand and height , weight and physique on the other is greatly reduced once social , background factors are taken into account .",metaphor,15,7,0.4666666666666667,VUA20,
"For example , lower working-class people are more likely to be mesomorphic as a result of their diet and continual manual labour , and this class grouping is more likely to be found represented in the criminal statistics .",metaphor,18,2,0.1111111111111111,VUA20,
"With regard to the links between criminal behaviour and inherited characteristics , there have been a number of theoretical explanations suggesting an association between criminality and particular personality characteristics .",metaphor,15,4,0.26666666666666666,VUA20,
"An example of this more sophisticated biological approach is the work of Hans Eysenck , who has argued in a series of studies , that there is a link between genetically based personality characteristics and criminal behaviour .",metaphor,17,3,0.17647058823529413,VUA20,
He maintains that there is a link between characteristics such as extroversion and criminal behaviour .,metaphor,6,2,0.3333333333333333,VUA20,
"An individual 's degree of extroversion or introversion is inherited , determined by his or her genetic make-up .",metaphor,8,4,0.5,VUA20,
"The link with crime found by Eysenck was that when prisoners were tested for extroversion , more extroverts were found than in the general population .",metaphor,11,3,0.2727272727272727,VUA20,
Eysenck then argues that extroversion is the inherited basis of criminal behaviour .,metaphor,7,1,0.14285714285714285,VUA20,
"Extroverts take longer to learn the rules of society , they are more likely to break them , and thus more likely become convicted criminals .",metaphor,13,3,0.23076923076923078,VUA20,
"As with Lombroso 's work and the Gluecks ' study discussed above , by starting with institutionalised criminals , it is assumed that all prisoners are criminals and that most criminals do , in fact , go to prison .",metaphor,15,1,0.06666666666666667,VUA20,
The people who get caught and imprisoned may not be a representative picture of all criminals .,metaphor,7,1,0.14285714285714285,VUA20,
The major problem faced by theories suggesting a link between genetic make-up and criminal behaviour is the difficulty of distinguishing between genetic and environmental effects .,metaphor,15,4,0.26666666666666666,VUA20,
"While some genetic influence can not be ruled out , just what is inherited remains very unclear .",metaphor,6,1,0.16666666666666666,VUA20,
Psychological theories,literal,2,0,0.0,VUA20,
These theories share certain similarities with biological explanations .,metaphor,6,1,0.16666666666666666,VUA20,
They stress the link between criminal behaviour and specific personality traits or characteristics .,metaphor,8,2,0.25,VUA20,
"Psychological theories , however , see these characteristics as a result of unusual or abnormal experiences , rather than as inherited .",metaphor,11,2,0.18181818181818182,VUA20,
"Thus , as with biological theories , crime is seen as pathological ( a disease ) , as something to be looked at from the medical point of view .",metaphor,12,4,0.3333333333333333,VUA20,
"However , psychological causes are seen as treatable , whereas biological causes mark the individual for life .",metaphor,10,1,0.1,VUA20,
"In those cases there is no possible treatment , one is born a criminal .",literal,5,0,0.0,VUA20,
"Many psychological theories refer to faulty parent-child relationships , such as abnormal experiences in early childhood having a lasting effect and influence on personality .",metaphor,15,1,0.06666666666666667,VUA20,
"Studies in this area have indicated that too strict or too lax parental attitudes increase the risk of delinquency ( the work of John Bowlby , for example ) ; they have found that if a young child is deprived of close personal relationships with parents or parent figures then ‘ problem behaviour ’ is more common .",metaphor,27,7,0.25925925925925924,VUA20,
"It is well established that in the delinquent-prone , home discipline is more liable to be too lax , strict or erratic .",metaphor,9,1,0.1111111111111111,VUA20,
"However , it is patently obvious that parents can be a good or bad influence and example for their children , and this fact can hardly be used to explain present patterns of crime .",metaphor,16,2,0.125,VUA20,
"The majority of offenders do not come from disturbed or broken homes , and many broken homes do not produce delinquents .",metaphor,11,4,0.36363636363636365,VUA20,
"Of course , this last point does not show that there is no link between parent-child relations and crime and delinquency .",metaphor,9,3,0.3333333333333333,VUA20,
"The problem with assessing the influence of parental and family dimensions , such as weak supervision or parental criminality , is the fact that they are closely linked to various aspects of social and economic disadvantage , such as poverty , overcrowding and poor housing .",metaphor,22,7,0.3181818181818182,VUA20,
"And it may be that these disadvantages help to cause parental difficulties , and hamper good parenting .",metaphor,8,1,0.125,VUA20,
"We can hardly do justice to the wide scope of psychological theories here , but there are some basic ideas and assumptions which underlie such theorizing .",metaphor,11,1,0.09090909090909091,VUA20,
"These stress the importance of family relationships and upbringing during the early years , and conclude that anti-social , and by implication criminal , behaviour results from faulty personality development .",metaphor,16,2,0.125,VUA20,
"To summarise , these biological and psychological theories hold that the criminal is a particular type of person , apart from the rest of society and with a special predisposition toward criminal behaviour .",metaphor,16,2,0.125,VUA20,
"They are based on the idea that criminal behaviour is either inherited or a consequence of unique , individual experiences .",metaphor,10,2,0.2,VUA20,
"Before we look at sociological explanations it might be useful to ask yourself , or to discuss with colleagues , whether you feel that criminals are different ‘ types ’ of person .",metaphor,12,2,0.16666666666666666,VUA20,
"While there are , no doubt , predispositions toward criminal behaviour , and clearly certain characteristics are inherited , most sociologists would reject these ‘ individual pathology ’ sort of theories .",metaphor,14,1,0.07142857142857142,VUA20,
They lack convincing supporting evidence .,metaphor,4,1,0.25,VUA20,
While some offenders suffer from mental disorders the vast majority do not .,metaphor,6,1,0.16666666666666666,VUA20,
"Furthermore , if criminals are abnormal then it follows that a large proportion of the population must also be abnormal .",metaphor,9,2,0.2222222222222222,VUA20,
"For numerous studies have shown that a high percentage of the population have committed criminal offences , in particular high proportions of juveniles , and it is difficult to believe that they are all different or abnormal .",metaphor,17,3,0.17647058823529413,VUA20,

"For example Roe ( 1952 ) , Eiduson ( 1962 ) and McClelland ( 1962 ) suggested that male scientists often experienced a lonely childhood , perhaps suffering social isolation through illness or family circumstances , so that they developed a strong interest in their surrounding material world and a below average interest in other people and relationships .",metaphor,28,5,0.17857142857142858,VUA20,

"Even if these descriptions are valid they still leave open a number of questions , particularly why the same mechanisms do not operate with girls .",metaphor,12,5,0.4166666666666667,VUA20,
Arising from the evidence in the literature and from our empirical studies at Chelsea College it is now possible to offer a model which is compatible with all the evidence and which also has considerable predictive potential .,metaphor,16,2,0.125,VUA20,
The evidence for an association between personality characteristics and an interest in science has been more fully reviewed by Head ( 1979 ) .,metaphor,9,2,0.2222222222222222,VUA20,
We need now only take note of the most salient features .,metaphor,5,3,0.6,VUA20,
The most obvious one is that of sex differences .,literal,4,0,0.0,VUA20,
"The predominance of males , particularly in the physical sciences and engineering , throughout the Western world can no longer be satisfactorily attributed to cognitive differences , which are too small , nor to institutional factors .",metaphor,16,1,0.0625,VUA20,
Equal opportunity in education and employment has not made science any more popular with women .,metaphor,8,1,0.125,VUA20,
"Furthermore , the characteristics of those students who do opt for science show clear sex differences .",metaphor,9,2,0.2222222222222222,VUA20,
"Male scientists , both science students and mature , professional scientists , tend to be emotionally reticent , disliking overt emotional expression in others and themselves , and depending upon their partners in personal relationships to take the emotional initiatives .",metaphor,22,2,0.09090909090909091,VUA20,
"They will also tend to be authoritarian , conservative and controlled in their thinking .",literal,6,0,0.0,VUA20,
These differences can be seen quite early on ; we have found boys aged 14 years who were opting for science to be significantly more authoritarian than their peers .,metaphor,13,2,0.15384615384615385,VUA20,
"Girls choosing science are not particularly emotionally reticent or rigid in their thinking , although they do seem to have low self-esteem in terms of being socially and sexually attractive .",metaphor,15,2,0.13333333333333333,VUA20,
We also know that at about the age of 13 a very high proportion of boys are attracted to science and scientific careers .,metaphor,10,3,0.3,VUA20,
"Thereafter , there is a steady decline of interest in science and this disillusionment extends right through the secondary-school years and into the undergraduate period .",metaphor,12,3,0.25,VUA20,
"In contrast , only a minority of girls express an interest in science at any age but there is no obvious swing from science in the middle and late teens .",metaphor,13,5,0.38461538461538464,VUA20,
Some further evidence has come from our use of sentence completion tests with secondary-school pupils as part of our research programme at Chelsea .,metaphor,12,3,0.25,VUA20,
Analysis of these responses provides further information on sex differences and between those opting for different subjects .,metaphor,9,2,0.2222222222222222,VUA20,
"For example , girls at the age of 12 and 14 years seem to take a more mature attitude to personal relationships , seeing their complexity and reciprocal nature , while boys are more exploitative .",metaphor,16,5,0.3125,VUA20,
"In relation to the sentence stem ‘ A girl and her mother … ’ , girls often produce responses like ‘ often go through a bad patch for a year but once they learn to understand each other , become the best of friends ’ or ‘ can help each other with their problems ’ .",metaphor,21,5,0.23809523809523808,VUA20,
"Similar questions , when asked of boys , tend to produce banal responses or exploitative ones , for example the parent is seen as the source of money .",metaphor,15,3,0.2,VUA20,
"In contrast , boys seem to have a firmer self-identity and a clearer ambition showing more insight in response to sentence stems such as ‘ My main problem is … ’ and ‘ He/she felt proud that … ’ .",metaphor,16,6,0.375,VUA20,
Such findings give us some clues about the characteristics of boys and girls of these ages .,metaphor,7,1,0.14285714285714285,VUA20,
"If we compare boys of 14 years of age who opt for science with other boys , we find that the former have very cut-and-dried views on many issues .",metaphor,13,2,0.15384615384615385,VUA20,
"For example , they take the view that ‘ criminals should be severely punished ’ or that ‘ anyone who is unpopular deserves his fate ’ .",metaphor,10,2,0.2,VUA20,
"To the sentence stem ‘ When a child will not join in group activities … ’ , these boys gave responses like ‘ he is selfish ’ , ‘ he must be stupid ’ , ‘ he deserves to be unpopular ’ .",metaphor,13,3,0.23076923076923078,VUA20,
"In contrast , other boys and most girls pondered the possible causes and ways of integrating the child into the group .",metaphor,10,2,0.2,VUA20,
"The science boys seemed to possess few doubts or uncertainties , they offered clear-cut answers .",metaphor,9,1,0.1111111111111111,VUA20,
It was this evidence which suggested the possible model for subject choice in terms of ego-identity achievement .,metaphor,9,3,0.3333333333333333,VUA20,
Ego-identity in adolescence,literal,2,0,0.0,VUA20,
This model was originally postulated by Erikson ( 1965 ) and then developed by Marcia ( 1966 and 1976 ) .,metaphor,6,1,0.16666666666666666,VUA20,
Erikson suggests that at different phases of life an individual faces a particular psycho-social problem which needs to be resolved before moving on to the next phase .,metaphor,15,6,0.4,VUA20,
For adolescents the acquisition of a clear ego-identity is the crucial task .,metaphor,6,2,0.3333333333333333,VUA20,
"At the beginning of adolescence , the individual is a within the family and the school .",literal,5,0,0.0,VUA20,
"By the end of adolescence he or she needs to make choices about career , life-style , personal relationships and ideologies .",metaphor,10,2,0.2,VUA20,
The ego-identity of that person is shaped by these choices .,metaphor,4,1,0.25,VUA20,
Erikson does not suggest that the development of an ego-identity is a once-and-for-all issue .,literal,6,0,0.0,VUA20,
"Some problems about identity arise with the young child in the context of home and school , and others occur in later life , for example on retirement .",metaphor,14,2,0.14285714285714285,VUA20,
"Nevertheless , adolescence is the time when ego-identity development inevitably dominates the personal development of the individual for a while .",metaphor,10,1,0.1,VUA20,
"The adolescent does not , however , need to achieve a clear ego-identity on all topics at one time .",metaphor,8,1,0.125,VUA20,
He or she may have a clear identity in respect to his or her career but still be unresolved in regard to personal relationships and ideology .,metaphor,10,1,0.1,VUA20,
In this article we are concerned with ego-identity achievement in respect to career .,literal,6,0,0.0,VUA20,
"Marcia has put more detail onto the Erikson model and suggests that in going from the initial ego-diffusion condition to that of having achieved ego-identity , two processes are involved : crisis and commitment .",metaphor,16,7,0.4375,VUA20,
Crisis in this context describes a period of intensive self-examination in which one 's beliefs and values are re-examined .,metaphor,10,5,0.5,VUA20,
Commitment means that the individual has acquired clear and firm beliefs both about himself or herself and the world .,metaphor,8,4,0.5,VUA20,
Figure 16.1 indicates a number of possible routes to ego-identity achievements .,metaphor,7,2,0.2857142857142857,VUA20,
"A person may undergo crisis and commitment simultaneously and progress by route A. An alternative is to undergo a period of considerable self-doubt and self-examination in which all one 's beliefs tend to be very fluid , a period known as moratorium , before acquiring beliefs for oneself and ego-identity is achieved ( route B ) .",metaphor,25,7,0.28,VUA20,
"A further possibility is that the individual may , at least for a time , hold onto beliefs and values taken without question from others , for example parents , teachers , peers .",metaphor,14,3,0.21428571428571427,VUA20,
This condition is known as foreclosure .,metaphor,3,2,0.6666666666666666,VUA20,
"Eventually these persons might have to face up to period of crisis , of self-examination , and so achieve ego-identity by route C. However , foreclosure does offer an escape route and an individual might postpone indefinitely any real self-examination by clinging rigidly to his or her beliefs and values ( route D ) .",metaphor,24,12,0.5,VUA20,
Ego-identity and Choosing Science,literal,3,0,0.0,VUA20,
We can now make the link between this model of adolescent development and subject choice in schools .,metaphor,8,4,0.5,VUA20,
"For boys at the foreclosure stage , science is likely to be appealing .",metaphor,6,2,0.3333333333333333,VUA20,
"The physical sciences in particular , offer a conventional career choice which is likely to win approval from parents , teachers and peers .",metaphor,13,2,0.15384615384615385,VUA20,
"They will tend to regard the overt expression of emotions , including much such expression in the arts , as being soft and feminine .",metaphor,11,2,0.18181818181818182,VUA20,
"Science , with its masculine image , makes little emotional demand on an individual and seems to offer clear , precise answers to problems .",metaphor,14,6,0.42857142857142855,VUA20,
Opting for science will permit and possibly reinforce emotional reticence .,metaphor,7,2,0.2857142857142857,VUA20,
For a girl at the foreclosure stage the situation is very different .,metaphor,5,3,0.6,VUA20,
"There is evidence that girls tend to be socialized into adult roles more through their potential of becoming a mother and housewife than through their career ( Douvan and Adelson , 1966 ) .",metaphor,13,1,0.07692307692307693,VUA20,
"Furthermore , these girls will tend to go into a career with a feminine image , one which already attracts many girls .",metaphor,11,3,0.2727272727272727,VUA20,
"Consequently , very few girls at the foreclosure stage will enter science unless they receive considerable encouragement and a model to do so from their parents and their school .",metaphor,12,4,0.3333333333333333,VUA20,
Neither boys nor girls at the moratorium stage are likely to be attracted to the science that is usually presented in our schools .,metaphor,10,3,0.3,VUA20,
"They are at a stage when they are likely to be concerned with a variety of complex issues ; the meaning of life , the existence of God , ideologies , their emerging sexuality , their future career and life-style — too often science is seen as being purely instrumental with nothing to contribute to these debates .",metaphor,24,3,0.125,VUA20,
"Science , somehow , seems to be scarcely relevant to the most important issues in our life .",literal,8,0,0.0,VUA20,
A proportion of both boys and girls at ego-identity achievement stage will choose science .,metaphor,8,3,0.375,VUA20,
"In fact , most girls entering science are probably at this stage as they will need some self-examination and sense of commitment to make this unconventional choice .",metaphor,13,4,0.3076923076923077,VUA20,
"However , only a minority of adolescents will have reached the ego-identity achievement stage at the age when most pupils have to make crucial decisions about subject choice at school .",metaphor,15,5,0.3333333333333333,VUA20,
This model seems to explain our observations .,metaphor,4,3,0.75,VUA20,
"A large number of boys , particularly at the foreclosure stage , are initially attracted to science but there is a drift away throughout later adolescence as they undergo some crisis .",metaphor,15,7,0.4666666666666667,VUA20,
"The preponderance of boys at the foreclosure stage will yield the rigid , authoritarian attitudes often associated with scientists .",metaphor,11,5,0.45454545454545453,VUA20,

Effects of Curriculum Changes,metaphor,3,1,0.3333333333333333,VUA20,
The real use of this model linking personality development to subject choice is that it allows us to make predictions about how pupils might react to changes in school science curriculum and school organization .,metaphor,19,8,0.42105263157894735,VUA20,
We can consider three possible changes :,metaphor,3,2,0.6666666666666666,VUA20,
Delaying subject choice : Britain is unusual in asking pupils to make crucial choices about subject options in the 13–16 age range .,metaphor,14,5,0.35714285714285715,VUA20,
These decisions can only be reversed with great difficulty .,metaphor,4,2,0.5,VUA20,
What effect would delaying the choice make ?,metaphor,4,1,0.25,VUA20,
"In the development through the years of adolescence the number of foreclosure pupils will diminish , hence the recruitment of boys into science would be cut .",metaphor,12,3,0.25,VUA20,
More boys and girls will have reached the ego-identity achievement stage and a proportion of these will go into science .,metaphor,9,4,0.4444444444444444,VUA20,
"Overall there would be a reduction in the number of students choosing science , but those who do so choose will be more likely to stay happily in the subject and to possess more flexible minds .",metaphor,14,4,0.2857142857142857,VUA20,
The quantitative loss would be met by a qualitative improvement .,metaphor,5,1,0.2,VUA20,
"Giving science a more feminine image : It is sometimes argued that science textbooks are sexist in showing illustrations of boys , rather than girls , doing practical work in the laboratory , and so forth .",metaphor,18,3,0.16666666666666666,VUA20,
What effect would a deliberate attempt to change this image have ?,metaphor,5,2,0.4,VUA20,
It might make it easier for girls at the foreclosure stage to accept science so recruitment might increase .,metaphor,9,3,0.3333333333333333,VUA20,
"Some of these girls might , however , drift away again when they reach their crisis period .",metaphor,7,4,0.5714285714285714,VUA20,
"Unless the change in image was immense , boys would probably not be affected , science would still be an obvious , acceptable choice for a boy .",metaphor,12,2,0.16666666666666666,VUA20,
"Overall there would be some increase in the recruitment of girls , but no qualitative improvement .",literal,6,0,0.0,VUA20,
"Emphasizing the applications and relevance of science : To obtain a major qualitative improvement to recruitment in science with more girls and with students possessing imaginative , flexible minds it would be necessary to make science appealing to boys and girls at the moratorium stage .",metaphor,24,6,0.25,VUA20,
In that event science must be seen to be relevant to the issues which concern them .,metaphor,6,1,0.16666666666666666,VUA20,
The probable implication is that science would need to be presented in the context of the needs of society and individuals .,metaphor,9,2,0.2222222222222222,VUA20,
"Probably a case-study approach involving the application of science , and the interaction with other disciplines , would be needed .",metaphor,9,3,0.3333333333333333,VUA20,
Our knowledge about the girls ' concern with personal relationships suggests that the introduction of some elements of the social sciences into the case studies might prove attractive .,metaphor,14,3,0.21428571428571427,VUA20,
Is it possible to change school science in this fashion and still preserve the essential character of science itself ?,metaphor,10,4,0.4,VUA20,
Clearly there would need to be some drastic pruning of content .,metaphor,5,1,0.2,VUA20,
Perhaps science teachers should not attempt to cover their subjects so comprehensively .,metaphor,7,2,0.2857142857142857,VUA20,
A history teacher is content to cover the history of one country or continent over a few decades .,metaphor,8,1,0.125,VUA20,
Perhaps we must make similar choices .,metaphor,4,1,0.25,VUA20,
It is interesting to notice that the Association for Science Education ( 1979 ) policy statement in Britain and the proposals on school physics coming from the Institute for Science Education ( IPN ) in Kiel are advocating such changes .,metaphor,19,3,0.15789473684210525,VUA20,

Dialectical reason encounters such products as undecidables :,metaphor,5,2,0.4,VUA20,

"In the dialectical perspective , we encounter these objects as productions which are human and provided with a future … thus they seem by themselves to be totalizations in process .",metaphor,12,3,0.25,VUA20,
"This means that first , they lead to results , and second , that the internal structure of social objects contains ‘ the double negation of themselves and of each constituent part by the other ’ ( II , 22 ) .",metaphor,14,8,0.5714285714285714,VUA20,

This increasingly comes to resemble nothing so much as Sartre 's own account of History .,metaphor,8,2,0.25,VUA20,
"In the context of the negativity of this formulation , Sartre is obliged to pose once again the problem of whether there can be a totalization , without any independent totalizer or totalizing force such as the dialectic , or whether the structure of negation that he has described means that , as for Adorno or Bakhtin , history does not develop positively but , rather , negatively , and is therefore instead detotalizing :",metaphor,27,6,0.2222222222222222,VUA20,
"Marxism is rigorously true if History is totalization ; it is not so any more if human history decomposes into a plurality of particular histories , or if , in any case , within the relationship of immanence that characterizes struggle , the negation of each adversary by the other is on principle detotalizing .",metaphor,20,6,0.3,VUA20,
"Certainly , we have neither the design nor the actual possibility of showing here the full truth of dialectical materialism …",metaphor,9,3,0.3333333333333333,VUA20,
"Our goal is solely to establish whether , in a practical ensemble torn apart by antagonism ( whether there are multiple conflicts or whether they are reduced to one ) the breaks themselves are totalizing and carried along by the totalizing movement of the ensemble .",metaphor,18,10,0.5555555555555556,VUA20,
"At this point Sartre confronts the possibility that the whole project of the Critique , stated so confidently on its very first page — ‘ it must be proved that a negation of a negation can be an affirmation ’ ( I , 15 ) — may break down .",metaphor,16,7,0.4375,VUA20,
perhaps the Truth of History can not be proved ; its direction can not be discerned .,metaphor,6,2,0.3333333333333333,VUA20,
"Sartre 's reaction to the threat that the negation of a negation may produce a detotalizing effect is to introduce a new category , a unifying force of a ‘ singularization ’ which incarnates the universal : ‘ If totalization really is an ongoing process ’ , he writes , ‘ then it operates everywhere .",metaphor,23,9,0.391304347826087,VUA20,

"Unlike Lukács ' insignificant event from which the universal is precariously drawn out through the narrative , Sartre 's singularity works synecdochally in a conventional antinomy with the universal , the relation between the two structured according to the familiar nineteenth-century model of organic growth or process in which each singular event makes up the whole while , as he puts it , ‘ the whole is entirely present in the part as its present meaning and as its destiny ’ .",metaphor,34,12,0.35294117647058826,VUA20,
"Sartre 's ‘ singular universal ’ , therefore , begs the question , for it is predicated on the assumption that , if there is not a totality as such , then there already is an overall totalization : ‘ If totalization really is an ongoing process … ’ .",metaphor,16,1,0.0625,VUA20,
"That developing process is itself totalized through Sartre 's assertion that each totalization is the totalization of all struggles , as it must be if the singular is to incarnate the universal .",metaphor,11,3,0.2727272727272727,VUA20,

So the singular universal presumes the totalization he ca n't ( yet ) prove .,metaphor,6,1,0.16666666666666666,VUA20,
"This strategy marks a structure of repetition in Sartre 's text : each time he poses the question of how there can be totalization of History without a totalizer , he retreats to a more limited example whose unity is already evident , but which in the end only brings him back to the original question again .",metaphor,23,7,0.30434782608695654,VUA20,
"In this case Sartre demonstrates how the singular universal works , by appealing to the concrete example of a boxing match — a random exemplification that just happens to reproduce the single adversaries of the master/slave dialectic .",metaphor,18,6,0.3333333333333333,VUA20,

"But it is also apparent that that totality is not completely known , nor is its future shape even presumed .",metaphor,9,1,0.1111111111111111,VUA20,
"By totalization , therefore , Sartre does not here mean anything like a predetermined end or final closure of a totality but rather a process of mediation among the parts , where each is determined by the other .",metaphor,15,4,0.26666666666666666,VUA20,

"Yet each individual bout articulates itself within the framework of the history of boxing , known and unknown .",metaphor,9,2,0.2222222222222222,VUA20,
This allows Sartre to include chance and contingency in his scheme .,metaphor,6,2,0.3333333333333333,VUA20,
"Since it can not be known as a concept that will realize itself in the future , Sartre argues instead that the totality only produces itself in the moment : ‘ The incarnation as such is at once unrealizable except as totalization of everything and irreducible to a pure abstract unity of that which it totalizes ’ ( II , 58 ) .",metaphor,19,4,0.21052631578947367,VUA20,

"thus one can and must say … that each fight is the singularisation of all the circumstances of the social whole in movement and that by this singularisation , it incarnates the enveloping totalization which the historical process is .",metaphor,14,3,0.21428571428571427,VUA20,
"But then he adds , ‘ I have said and I repeat that we have not yet proved that this enveloping totalization exists ’ .",metaphor,8,1,0.125,VUA20,
"So , although it is possible to conceive of any event as an incarnation of the totality , insofar as it must itself make up a part of that totality in its determination , unlike the case of the boxing match , where we can define the overall entity ‘ boxing ’ , it still remains unproven that an overall entity , ‘ History ’ , can be said to exist at all .",metaphor,25,5,0.2,VUA20,
"For all his use of the model of the boxing match , Sartre has really got no further with the fundamental question of how there can be totalization without a totalizer .",metaphor,11,2,0.18181818181818182,VUA20,
"It is simple enough for him to show that a boxing match takes place within a general totality of ‘ boxing ’ , which is itself only ever present in any individual incarnation , for as a game each match is both an individual bout and something conducted according to general rules and a specific social tradition .",metaphor,26,5,0.19230769230769232,VUA20,

"Where the end is person- rather than role-oriented — that is , where the end is the development of the human mind and spirit rather than the production of , say , information technologists — then education is valued in relation to some conception of worthwhile human existence which it is meant to serve .",metaphor,23,7,0.30434782608695654,VUA20,

When philosophers dismiss women as ‘ not-men ’ they frequently do more than simply lump them together with children or lunatics .,metaphor,10,2,0.2,VUA20,

"The assumption that all groups in the ‘ not-men ’ class are identical with each other is so firmly rooted that , as we shall see in the fourth section , it is readily assumed even by modern libertarian thinkers that showing that , for example , some ground for distinguishing between men and women is false or irrelevant , immediately commits us to the view that the same ground is irrelevant in distinguishing men from children .",metaphor,32,13,0.40625,VUA20,

"However much she may enjoy such pursuits , there will be times when she would actually rather wander the streets unaccompanied .",literal,10,0,0.0,VUA20,
"Given that Holt is presumably not volunteering himself to take care of her , who will ?",metaphor,6,1,0.16666666666666666,VUA20,
His view that letting children run in and out of busy airports smartly avoiding the traffic is perfectly reasonable depends upon a conception of a child which is far narrower than even the sex divide .,metaphor,19,4,0.21052631578947367,VUA20,
"Holt 's child is actually the Artful Dodger ; mercifully , not all children are .",metaphor,7,2,0.2857142857142857,VUA20,
There are other difficulties too .,literal,1,0,0.0,VUA20,
"It is not clear whether or not Harris thinks that children of 10 should be obliged to take on full political status whether or not they want to , but Holt clearly does not .",metaphor,12,2,0.16666666666666666,VUA20,
"He proposes that ‘ the rights , privileges , duties , responsibilities of adult citizens be made available to any young person , of whatever age , who wants to make use of them ’ ( Holt , 1974 , p. 15 ) .",metaphor,16,2,0.125,VUA20,
"If Holt thinks that this proposal would remove an arbitrary boundary line between adults and children , then he is mistaken .",metaphor,10,3,0.3,VUA20,
"The point about an adult citizen is that he has these rights , privileges , duties and responsibilities whether or not he wants them .",metaphor,8,1,0.125,VUA20,
"He may not exercise his rights or he may shirk his duties , but he can not forgo them .",metaphor,5,1,0.2,VUA20,
"They are not just available to him , they are his .",literal,1,0,0.0,VUA20,
That is what being a citizen involves .,metaphor,2,1,0.5,VUA20,
Rights and privileges do not pose any particular problems in the case of children .,literal,7,0,0.0,VUA20,
"Holt can and does believe that children should have them as adults do , and then leaves it up to the child to decide whether or not to exercise them .",metaphor,8,2,0.25,VUA20,
But the same can not be said for duties and responsibilities .,metaphor,3,1,0.3333333333333333,VUA20,
Failure to exercise one 's rights may be morally neutral ; failure to carry out one 's duties is not .,metaphor,8,1,0.125,VUA20,
"It would be perfectly possible to give the rights to children without imposing the duties on them , the one does not entail the other , but we would then still be distinguishing between adults and children as citizens .",metaphor,14,3,0.21428571428571427,VUA20,
Children still would not have full political status .,metaphor,5,1,0.2,VUA20,
Duties and responsibilities are not merely available to a citizen ; they are an integral part of being a citizen .,metaphor,8,2,0.25,VUA20,
Holt does not want children to be obliged to take on any of these responsibilities and he manages to make his point by concentrating solely on the rights so that he can remark :,metaphor,13,4,0.3076923076923077,VUA20,
"I do not say , either , that these rights and duties should be tied into one package , that if a young person wants to assume any of them , he must assume them all .",metaphor,11,3,0.2727272727272727,VUA20,
He should be able to pick and choose .,metaphor,3,1,0.3333333333333333,VUA20,
"If he can ‘ pick and choose ’ , I suggest , he is not a citizen , he does not have full political status and he is quite distinguishable on these grounds alone from the adults around him who do not have this option .",metaphor,13,4,0.3076923076923077,VUA20,
"Holt and Harris both , in the end , face the same problem .",metaphor,5,2,0.4,VUA20,
"They attack the status quo by pointing out that the reasons given for denying rights to children are bad reasons , and then explicitly or implicitly deny them duties for no reason at all .",metaphor,16,3,0.1875,VUA20,
"Whatever else such a strategy may achieve , it certainly does not manage to produce a situation in which children are politically indistinguishable from adults and it rests on premises which , unless they can be defended , gain nothing for any defence to the charge of arbitrariness .",metaphor,19,11,0.5789473684210527,VUA20,
"WHEN IN DOUBT , GO BACK TO ARISTOTLE",metaphor,4,2,0.5,VUA20,
The trouble with all the views which we have looked at is that they tie the notion of autonomy firmly and solely to that of knowledge interpreted in either a broad or narrow sense .,metaphor,13,9,0.6923076923076923,VUA20,
That it is firmly tied must be correct ; the inhabitants of Brave New World are not autonomous precisely because they are denied access to relevant information .,metaphor,13,7,0.5384615384615384,VUA20,
Relevant knowledge is a precondition of autonomy but it is not synonymous with it .,metaphor,5,2,0.4,VUA20,
Aristotle said something very interesting in that extract from the Politics which I quoted earlier ; he said that women have a deliberative faculty but that it lacks full authority .,metaphor,15,5,0.3333333333333333,VUA20,
