There’s also ample evidence his administration knew 9/11 would happen and didn’t take action. Whether we blame Bush or not, his administration was absolutely foul and likely stamped the death of thousands of people.

"By Martha McHardy — US News Reporter |

A clear majority of voters would choose a Democrat candidate for Congress if the midterms were held today, a new poll shows.

The PBS News/NPR/Marist survey, conducted between November 10 and 13, revealed that 55 percent of voters would elect a Democratic candidate, compared to 41 percent who would opt for a Republican.

The 14-point lead for the Democrats is the party's largest since November 2017. In 2018, during Trump's first term, the Democrats won more than 40 seats in the House of Representatives in the midterm elections.

I’m genuinely asking what Dems can actually do to stop the GOP’s agenda *now*. What exactly are people wanting or expecting?


But with regards to this:

> If the Dems just did X (hold firm on the shutdown, not conceding to a handshake deal on extending healthcare subsidies, force Mike Johnson to swear in Grijalva before agreeing to end the shutdown, force an emergency full funding on SNAP benefits while in shutdown, and not accept any concessions until Republicans agree to those terms) then they could stop certain aspects of the GOP's agenda.

What would that actually look like? How could the Dems *force* Johnson and the GOP to make those sizable concessions, when those people were perfectly fine continuing the shutdown?

">None of this screed addresses the notion that Europe is one of the major sources of funding for Russia's war in Ukraine and that they've failed to rise to the threat of Russian revanchism.

I wasn't addressing that notion. *You* wanted me to address that notion because you think you can somehow argue against that with ""uhm, well, we technically spend a couple billion more on oil than on Ukranian aid. Checkmate!"" when that has been frequently explained by the fact that a) purchases of Russian resources have diminished by sometimes as much as 90% compared to pre-war levels, and b) the remaining 10% of purchases are *only* waht is necessary so Europe has the manufacturing capacity to actually continue supporting Ukraine. The remaining 10% are scheduled to run out in 2027 and the only one who will still keep importing is Hungary cause we know Orban sucks Putin's dick.

Literally a ton of the support necessary for your statement to work is that yes, two countries in Europe *are* Putin stooges, so we *know* they do and will continue to buy resources. That doesn't invalidate the 90% drop compared to pre-war levels and the complete phase out.

>You can complain all you want about Trump (and fuck that guy all the way to the sun), but if Europe had been pulling its weight since the beginning of this and actually showed some real goddamn initiative, Trump wouldn't matter.

We've been *consistently* supporting Ukraine more than the fucking US throughout mid-2025 to the tune of 10-20% more, and the only reason Americans even go back on this shit is because while they deliver weapons *directly* and inflate the worth of 20 year old equipment, we directly pay premium for these weapons.

America has taken a rocket worth a million in 1995, slapped a $1 million price tag on it in 2025 and sent it over to Ukraine at a premium while the MIC re-stocks the American capacities.

I know, it's something Americans don't like to hear, but even fucking *Biden* slow-trickled the aid deliveries and inflated the numbers to give the MIC more profit.

"He's not confusing the two, but he is also kind of wrong...

Mussolini 100% started as a socialist; both of his parents were, and he personally went so far as being arrested for his work in the Italian socialist party. We are talking pro union, workers right, the work. The thing is, the guy was motivated by the concept of a revolution, the cult of action, more than anything. Right wing or left wing, as long as the current structure was toppled he didn't really care ultimately.

So yeah, by the time he became THE fascist he was fully, totally, right wing, but for a time he was a bona fide socialist.

Edit: to add, socialism and fascism where in there infancy. We can see today that fascism is a godawful piece of shit, but at the time the idea was new, attractive. Confusing fascism and socialism today is absolutely absurd if you look at history for a second, but i think it wasn't as clear for many at the time.

"The CSCE Final Act doesn't contain anything more binding. Its an agreement from the 80s that was essentially just a statement by everyone involved that they recognize and will respect each other's borders, it was a way to try to tone down some of the rhetoric of the cold war. There's nothing in there about collective action or *guaranteeing* the borders of all signatories. 

The inclusion by reference in the Budapest Memorandum looks to be more a statement along the lines of ""since Ukraine didnt exist as an independent country then, we will agree to recognize and respect Ukraine's borders in line with the principles established in this previous agreement."" The actual enforcement for violations is still just that they have to be brought to the UNSC.

I have no disagreement with anyone who says that the US using economic leverage or trying to get Ukraine to give up territory could be interpreted as the US going against the Budapest Memorandum, though personally I think its safe to say it became defunct once the Russian invasion was brought to the UNSC.

Let's face it - nobody likes you more because you're wearing a big logo on your sweatshirt.

Nobody wants to be your pal because you spent way too much for that garish Disney jacket that you wore twice and hid in the back of your closet. 

Nobody loves you because your entire identity is wrapped around the logos you wear in public. 

Bottom line? Buying clothing with a prominent brand name on it is a sucker bet, and I refuse to buy clothes with company logos. No Balenciaga, no Converse, no Izod, no Nike...nothing. I wear unbranded, quality clothes and shoes that cost a fraction of the the price of the crap festooned with gaudy logos - and my purchases don't go out of style or off-trend as quickly as branded stuff does. 

Don't believe me? Go through your closet and drawers and see how many branded items you don't wear anymore because you don't want to look outdated or off-trend. My friend spent $400 for a Canada Goose coat, but stopped wearing it after a couple of months because EVERYBODY was wearing Canada Goose coats and the brand totally lost its cachet in her opinion. And that's just the tip of the iceberg for her and millions of other people. 

All of this stuff ends up going to Goodwill or getting thrown away, and the ""investment"" in branded clothing turns out to be a complete waste of money.

"The Olympics should be abolished The Olympics have caused horrible human rights violations all over the world as well as controversy and abuse of athletes. Mexico city gunned down student protesters who were protesting the Olympics, Munich athletes murdered, homeless people shuttled out of the host cities so they could keep up appearances, misused city funds to build temporary Olympic villages instead of addressing the needs of resident.

"The Hobbit Trilogy is perfectly fine No, its not the Lotr. If you expected it to be, that’s your own problem. Going into it thinking you were going to experience watching Lotr for the first time again is what ruined it for many of you.
And yes, there are many people who enjoy these films.

They’ve got the casting down again, Martin Freeman’s performance as Bilbo alone is top tier.

The writing is of the same quality as Lotr. And the same adaptation methods. Too many nods to Lotr? Why not? Most of them are naturally built in and the ones added don’t completely collapse the story. Sure there’s two or three that are a bit weird but again nothing to cry about. 

Logical changes, best example is the black arrow. It’s setup to be something special that can actually do damage to a dragon. Hell, just setting up Bard as a character alone is an amazing adaptation change from just dropping him in “some rando just killed the dragon”

Character changes, Thorin is just a complete ass in the book, nothing redeeming. In the movie he feels like a leader and a actual relationship developed between him and Bilbo, giving some emotional weight to Thorin’s breakdown in BotFA.
I wept the entire ending of BotFA from Thorin’s death till after the credits finished. I don’t understand how the film declared to be that bad could hit me so emotionally. 

Too much CGI? Not really. The only real extra use of the CGI come from Orcs, usually their heads/faces to avoid makeup time/cost and from the larger variety of height differences this story deals with.
 
It’s just mind boggling the mindset of…
Balrog in Lotr = wow cool cgi
Smaug in Hobbit = too much CGI
Moria in Lotr = wow cool cgi
Erebor in Hobbit = too much CGI

Legolas, why not have him in the film? Fan favorite, his father and kingdom is in the book.

"Big Concerts are Terrible First I want to distinguish a show from a concert. I’m talking about big venues with big acts. Everything is too loud, there’s too many people, and everything costs too much. You can barely see the act you came to see because they’re so far away on a massive stage. All of the best concerts I’ve ever been to were small and intimate. Big concerts you just get lost in the crowd and it doesn’t really feel like it matters. DJ’s especially are just playing songs and aren’t really doing anything crazy with their transitions or song choices. Maybe things are just getting too big and I’m also getting too old but people my age are still obsessed with going to concerts. Feels like people just go for the visuals which I understand but it just all seems like a lot for such a short experience. Honestly everything is just too expensive. If it wasn’t $100+ to see a relatively small act and even more for super popular acts, I wouldn’t be saying a thing.

"destination weddings are selfish not always of course, but if you KNOW your friends and family can't afford it, or can barely afford it, and you know it's going to be difficult for most of your guests to make arrangements, it's just a shitty move. I know weddings (ideally) only happen once and you want it to be special but it just feels so extra and inconsiderate to expect other people to take time off work AND spend all that money on flights, hotels, sitters, etc. 

EDIT: a few points I've seen come up
1. ""it's not about you, it's the couple's day"" well yes, but a wedding is also an event. the couple are hosts ag the end of the day, and if you don't care about the guests that badly then just elope? 
2. ""every wedding is a destination for out of towners"" this is true and I didnt think about it, but also I was mainly referring to expensive and very far overseas destinations, like an American having a wedding in Japan or something for example.
3. ""it's a hint that they don't actually want you there/they do that so they don't have to cause drama by not inviting you"" to that i say grow tf up. you're ready for marriage but not to set boundaries? passive agressive, mind games, whatever you wanna call that little social plausible deniability dance, is just immature. 

Ultimately, people can do their wedding how they want. I'm speaking on myself personally, I'd never plan an event meant for my loved ones to celebrate me and then set it up so it was hard or even impossible for those loved ones to attend. If I want the travel experience I'll just plan a destination honeymoon, and I won't be worried about anyone but me and my partner.

I don't think charity makes you a good person. Charity is like investment to them. It just to make themselves look good and make money. They don't really give a shit about anyone.

Secondly, If someone is earning 2-3 million a year then donating like 1% of your income to charity doesn't mean shit.

Not everyone is bad tho. There are genuine good celebs out there but protecting them by saying they so charity is stupid and you should be in jail for being stupid.

"Both DD/MM/YYYY and MM/DD/YYYY are equally as bad As a standard, both are fine because the local population understand which 2 digits are month and day, and it is identical to how the local language orders dates. The argument that DD/MM/YYYY is better because it's from smallest to largest is just wrong. It's actual order is 2nd smallest, 1st smallest, 4th smallest, etc.

Here's how the actual triangle representation should look like: [https://imgur.com/a/date-formats-tNsIebv](https://imgur.com/a/date-formats-tNsIebv)

Both are not in order from most significant digit to least significant digit, but at the very least, MM/DD is properly sorted if the year is already known. YYYY/MM/DD is just much better than both.

Edit to add more information on what I mean by significant digit:

The more change you get when you modify a digit, the greater it's significance. The 1st digit of YYYY is most significant because a change in that is +/- 1000 years (e.g. 2025 > 3025), where as the 2nd digit of DD is the least significant.

I guess my unpopular opinion is that digits should be taken into account for a format, and neither DD/MM/YYYY and MM/DD/YYYY properly sorts by digits.

"Thanksgiving isn't as prevalent anymore because major companies can't make money off of it and its important that we don't let it happen. This is not important to anyone who isn't in the US don't know because this isn't backed up in any form of educated proof, but recently i've been seeing advertisements following the halloween season, only to find that every single add having to do with the holidays has been about Christmas, I find this concerning because it seems like companies used to at least acknowledge the time, but now since they don't I believe its because they've grown to much onto us and because we are all so dependent on their goods they are starting to overstep because we are allowing them to walk all over our culture as a society, which was little and weak as it was. I believe that if this continues all that is going to happen is that the US is going to continue a path of consumerism, greed and loneliness in the last 3 months of the year because we can't stop buying our funny toys and clothes from AMAZON and TEMU for christmas 5 months ahead, to a point where you don't even know why you're buying things instead of supporting the shop owner in your neighborhood.

"The Germans specialty in the scientific endeavors was never engineering, but chemistry TL;DR - Analyzing German history since around 1870 their advances in Chemistry have always lead or outdid the rest of the world. Engineering reputation is overrated.

I am engineer and now a college teaching professor. I teach introductory engineers and for self-pacing and to pass on the tradition of scientific inquiry correctly, I decided to offer up some scientific history to offer some storytelling opportunities. One thing I do is make sure they understand some of the context related to engineering and what problems they were trying to solve to get them to think about the problem. Mixed success.

In that process I did notice some trends in which European states (I end up focusing on Europe and later America and Russia as advances outside of Europe either lagged or were still informal) specialized in different disciplines. The French, math. The Italians, physics, The Dutch, civil engineering and agriculture, and adding in Americans and Russians, manufacturing, electricity, and industrial agriculture. I noticed however that the German contribution to engineering, particularly mechanical engineering was not that impressive. What they did do better, especially after the German Empire was founded was Chemistry. 

Haber Bosch Process, Fischer Trospch, Ostwald Process, Soxhlet extraction, the first chemical weapons are all German advances. Germans also discovered polyethylene and polystyrene. Every time I dig deeper I find Germans at the top of chemistry. 

When analyzing their engineering capabilities (mechanical and electrical) I find it lacking. Looking at WWII as some of pinnacle of their technology, the reliability of their equipment was lacking and they could not produce good enough at scale. The Russians flat out mass-produced better tanks, Americans had better planes, and the British made better ships (seethe Wehraboos). Their auto industry has similar reliability issues even today and are more expensive to fix than vehicles made by Toyota, Honda, Ford, and GM. Their firearms are also in poor shape. I have heard their turbines are decent, but GE still controls that market.

In conclusion, Germans have made better chemist historically.

It's ok to ask for a gift back. My opinion is that you should be able to ask for a gift back that you bought with your hard earned money for any reason. The person receiving the gift should not feel entitled to receive the gift. I don't agree with the law on that the gift is now their property because it was said to be a gift. I think the only people entitled to the gift is the person who paid for it and worked hard for it and should be allowed to ask for it back and can legally own it if asking for it back. I feel like too many Americans have a sense of entitlement and forget how hard it can be to make money/ afford things and sometimes we make mistakes in our judgements. Things like this shouldn't ruin relationships. It's ridiculous and to me if someone worked hard to buy a gift for me and asked for it back I will give it back because I know how hard it is to make money and again sometimes we make an impulsive purchase and have buyers regret. There should be protection for people with buyers regret and what about those who get pressured and manipulated into buying a gift?

"Soft skills are no different than tech skills I often hear people say that soft skills are often the key difference and that soft skills cannot be taught.

In my opinion, soft skills are no different than hard skills and can be taught if a person is willing to learn.

I'd figure this isn't actually unpopular, but every single time I say this, people always push back on it, even self described ""people pleasers"", so I'm not sure.

""People are only disagreeing because they're thinking just being a good person is being a people pleaser. That's not at all what that term means in general. People pleasers are people who go out of their way to help everyone even at huge detriment to themselves because they're afraid of having anyone dislike them. That's not the same thing as just helping someone because you want to/can.

I would know because I've been both. There's a huge difference.""

"Expedition 33 is mediocre and does not deserve all the hype In fact it is so overhyped and all the positive comments are so generic that I would go as far to say that the games creators are using bots to fake the hype.

Look, I have been playing games for 30 years now and I also, both, make games AND work in the industry (I make game engines - tools) and I have never seen such hype for a game that is so mediocre in ALL fronts.

First things first, yes the game is pretty and the music is good ... but apart from that:

The combat:  The game is generic turn-based slop because it removes almost all forms of meaningful strategy, that most turn-based games have, replacing them with a parry and dodge mechanic (literally the worst part of souls-like games\* I will explain this further down) that is mediocre at best. By default the parry is set as R1 / RT button that takes longer to trigger and some controllers might not have the best response time alongside the fact that the music by default is too damn loud and the supposed audio queues for the enemies attack varies in each move / monster - if you add the input latency of the display (and if it's an older TV without a game-mode it's even worst) you have no clue when the boss strikes next turn - you would have to repeat the same encounter multiple times - essentially dying - just to learn the correct timing to trigger the parry / dodge. This is BAD DESIGN. The design choice of the Soul's games to implement a dodge and parry in such a way is a compromise they have to make so that the production of the combat sequence is faster and cheaper - because more complex behavior that both uses the nature of the media (that being theatrical and at a distance) and a better and more direct way to communicate the attack would significantly extend production times and animation times. So both the souls games and especially this slop-fest use simple timings and a swinging motion to signal and incoming attack and then because the resources are limited and the publicly available animation systems usually SUCK the developers do not put in the work to mitigate the latency - to create faster animations or better animation blending techniques to be able to even parry the attack in the last frame. Then they let the player just die a thousand times just to learn the animation sequences. This is down-right pathetic design.

The story: is overly dramatic.",reddit_unpopularopinion,post,0,2025-11-18 11:30:04,https://reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/1p0gifc/expedition_33_is_mediocre_and_does_not_deserve/,921,509,True,512-1K

"Apple pie is only good with whipped cream or a la mode Apple pie, and other similar chunked and cooked fruit based deserts, have a horrible, horrible texture.

The texture of cooked fruit is slimey and the fruit is usually inconsistently cooked, resulting in an unpredictable mouthfeel. You can't even take a slice normally because the slimey fruit just slips out from between the crust pieces.

The only way to combat this is with whipped cream or ice cream, whose delectable creaminess help round out the slimey insides of a pie.

I don't understand why everyone doesn't just blend the fruits and make tarts or something like an apple-pumpkin pie (pumpkin pie is goated).

And this is coming from someone who enjoys okra and raw oysters. The texture of cooked fruits like in apple pie is horrible!

"Thanksgiving dinner is massively overhyped... Here’s my scorching hot take...Thanksgiving dinner isn’t actually good. Turkey, mashed potatoes, stuffing...they’re three of the blandest, most flavorless foods imaginable, and if they weren’t wrapped in decades of cultural hype, nobody would ever look forward to this meal.

Think about it. If you had a menu in front of you right now and the two options were...

* a slab of turkey with potatoes and stuffing OR
* a juicy New York strip with creamy mac & cheese

…no rational person is choosing the turkey. Not a single one. The only time we get excited about it is this *one* day a year, and that excitement is 95% nostalgia and 5% gravy trying to fix a fundamentally boring piece of meat.

Turkey isn’t a centerpiece protein...it’s a culinary chore. The only way to make it palatable is to brine it, drown it in butter, inject it, deep-fry it, and smother it in gravy. And even then, it’s just…fine. Same with stuffing (wet bread) and mashed potatoes (texture held together by butter and dairy).

Here’s the real tell...  
Nobody makes a full Thanksgiving meal in March.  
Nobody suddenly craves turkey and stuffing in July.  
Nobody goes out to a restaurant and orders “the Thanksgiving plate.”

Because deep down we know the truth - it’s not a great meal...it’s a *ritual*. A nostalgia event. A cultural performance piece wrapped in tradition, family memories, and Norman Rockwell imagery. And that’s fine! But let’s not pretend we’re talking about world-class cuisine.

If Thanksgiving dinner weren’t glued to a event, it would have died out years ago. It survives solely because of tradition, not taste.",reddit_unpopularopinion,post,0,2025-11-18 08:05:13,https://reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/1p0beh1/thanksgiving_dinner_is_massively_overhyped/,422,422,False,384-512
"Avatar 2 is a horse girl movie in disguise Most discussions about Avatar 2 was about if it's a good movie or bad, about the technical advancements, visual effects, if it is a cinematic masterpiece or not and other stuff. But my unpopular opinion is that it was a horse girl movie in disguise and apparently no one noticed it just because the gender was switched and the horse was a fancy whale. 
Here let me prove it: 

Plot of a typical horse girl feel good movie: 

Girl has to move to new place against her will. Girl has trouble fitting in to new place and can't find friends or connect to local teenagers. Scene where girl get humiliated by local teenagers. Girl somehow ends up in front of wild/untamed horse. Girls can pet it/ride it or gets saved by it. Girl tells people about said animal but people either don't believe her or say that this animal is dangerous and to stay away from it. Girl is angry nobody believes her and/or curious about animal. Girl is sure she knows better than everyone else and they ""just don't understand"" the wild/dangerous horse how she does. Girl returns to ""dangerous"" horse multiple times in secret to form a friendship over a few weeks. Happy riding scene showing their special friendship and connection. Something happens that is a danger to horse (and/or people). Girl tries to warn people and trying to rally them for help. People don't believe her. Bad thing happens. Girl has to show everyone her special friendship to horse is true. Scene: ""No don't, it's dangerous!"" screams while girl runs to horse, hops on and rides it to prove their special bond. Everyone is astonished but quickly forgets about the ""danger"" of the horse since apparently it's now tame with that special friendship and completely trustworthy to be around. Everyone now believes the girl about the dangerous situation/bad guy that she told them about previously but they didn't believe her and that the horse is totally just ""misunderstood"". Everyone chooses to join the fight against the evil with girl&horse to rescue the horse/herd/barn/whatever. Big fight/horse competition they have to win/rescue scene. Happy end.

"Gacha, loot boxes, card packs, roulette mechanics, most battle passes, etc should be an instant Ao rating... ​There is no justifiable timeline where it should be legal for a form of mass-market entertainment like gaming to be allowed to be specifically engineered to continually drain money out of people (gacha, loot boxes, etc) and carry a rating of anything but Ao. This is not about optional content; it is about unregulated psychological exploitation and consumer harm.

​Publishers squeak around it being gambling using money conversions to in-game currency which you use to gamble. The fact that you ""get something regardless"" doesn't change the fact that you are shoving money into a game to gamble for items and content that have purposely low rates to ensure they drain as much money out of players.
​Publishers cynically and happily avoid the Ao rating because it is still one of the things companies and regulators wrongfully think is damaging on top of blocking access to major brick and mortar stores and digital storefronts like all of the major consoles and phone stores. This is pure hypocrisy, especially since they keep saying gaming is a mature form of entertainment and ""not just for children"" while most games are specifically engineered to attract and get their attention even when it shouldn't (cod).

​They are happy ""gamers"" fight against the thought of Ao games because it keeps the status quo. They don’t fear the adult content; they fear losing access to the millions of children and younger gamers who are key, vulnerable players and consumers for high spending on top of the easily manipulated aka people who literally can't control themselves.

​Marvel Rivals is a good example of this creative failure that serves the profit model:

​Cosmic Invasion is a comic book game made to actually be nothing more than a comic book game, it's a low scale, throwback beat 'em up like many games they make when they want to gain low risk attention. It's a complete product, but it's something that is aesthetically, technically, and mechanically simple in comparison to many of the modern games that come out. It's a game I wouldn't be surprised to see on a PS2 or lower.

​Meanwhile, Rivals has this grand implied narrative, which is continually updated with cool and interesting characters, some of which we've never seen before in a game.

"The Velvet Underground & Nico is, imo, not as good as people think it is. This could go for the band itself in general, but this album for me is probably the greatest example of the divide between influence and quality of the music as it stands on its own. It’s basically the birth of alternative and indie/underground/avant-grade/cool/hip-type music as we know it. Admittedly the album also helped normalize a lot of topics and issues that were seen as very transgressive at the time, such as drug use and gender identity and social struggles (you know which I’m talking about), and that that’s all well and good. But now, knowing all of that and acknowledging all of that, both for good and for bad, I graded albums that I listen to purely based on the music itself, on its own merits, independent from any sort of influence or things that it might have wrought, since those are things that the artist or band or album itself has no control over, which is why I usually find it a little unfair to judge an album based on those metrics; having said that, there is still *some* good stuff on the album, like genuinely. Sunday Morning is quite lovely, I’m Waiting for the Man is great, There She Goes Again has a sweet groove and strut to it which the band admitted they stole from Marvin Gaye‘s Hitch Hike (nice), and Femme Fatale is even kind of cool. The rest of the album though, at it’s best, I think is musically just OK. I’ve never been a fan of All Tomorrow’s Parties or Venus in Furs or Heroin, and the album ends with the duo of The Black Angel’s Death Song and European Son, which just end the album on more of a noisy-for-sake-of-it tantrum than a lasting impact; those two are zero star songs for me, and they’re like an ice pick to the ear.

So overall, taking the music itself, some of it does stand on its own, but a lot of it doesn’t, and overall, I don’t think the album has a whole musically is as good as maybe people think it is.

leave an event early so you can go to bed and you’re called a baby or made fun of. if you’re not willing to stay awake for hours past bedtime to do an activity that can easily be done during normal social hours you’re boring

people don’t realise that the reason they feel terrible is because they don’t sleep enough. if everyone got a few more hours in bed every night we’d have a much happier population. sleep deprivation is a real epidemic ",reddit_unpopularopinion,post,653,2025-11-15 11:20:10,https://reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/1oxvrt2/sleep_deprivation_is_a_serious_problem_in_our/,267,267,False,256-384
"We need to change the term conspiracy ""theories"" to conspiracy hoaxes I feel like using the definitions for the words conspiracy and hoax will hopefully back up my argument:  
  
A theory is a scientifically acceptable or plausible general principle or body of principles based on facts

A hoax is a plan to deceive someone. 

We should use the term conspiracy ***hoaxes*** because half of these are just built to deceive and lie to people about history, about politics, about literally anything.

"Gaming Laptops Gaming laptops are a nice novelty but if you just want to game, get a console or actual gaming PC.

Issues with gaming laptops:

- the battery drains too fast (whatever setup you have). 
- If you play on battery it will often automatically enforce lower settings.
- it’s not really anymore portable than a console, you’ll still end up plugging it in.
- you will need peripheral devices to actually game (mouse and keyboard)
- the hardware is unnecessarily difficult to replace due to the nature of the build
- the parts can be difficult to procure
- warranties are a pain if you need to repair (send it off somewhere).
- the cooling systems are not fit for purpose and eventually will overheat/fail. 
- they aren’t built to last much longer than the warranty period if used regularly under heavy load.
- you need to elevate the laptop to ensure good airflow, so you have to buy more accessories.
- they tell you to clean the dust that accumulates inside the laptop but opening the case voids the warranty.
- always comes with bloatware pre installed and sometimes this is integral to system control (looking at you ASUS - fuck armory crate).
- one piece of the hardware will always be lacking in the whole setup (e.g. great gpu but shitty cpu), to help keep the price down.

"Media literacy isn't dead; it was never alive There's this quite clearly uncritically accepted idea that media literacy is dead because people can't parse the media they watch or listen to or read.

But here's the thing: I think in the best days of the past, most people couldn't parse the media they watched, listened to, or read.

[Walter Cronkite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Cronkite), the most trusted man in America during the 1960s and 1970s, only had that title because people didn't bother actually critiquing him on their own. They didn't have alternative frameworks to even evaluate the events he reported. They weren't media literate. They were media sponges who just accepted whatever Cronkite told them.

The same is true of other types of media. Books like Walter Lippman's [Public Opinion](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08821127.2022.2161665) discuss how the media was used manipulate how people saw the world all the way back in the 1920s. Daniel Boorstin's [The Image](https://www.amazon.com/Image-Guide-Pseudo-Events-America/dp/0679741801) shows how media created events that drove media engagement \*for media engagement\* rather than being informative. Boorstin calls out Joe McCarthy, the anti-communist Red Scare architect, for being a masterful pseudo-event generator.

Media literacy couldn't have died because most people have never had the capacity to be media literate. Conversely, today, more people than ever have that capacity, and simply choose not to be.",reddit_unpopularopinion,post,135,2025-11-15 10:42:07,https://reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/1oxutmv/media_literacy_isnt_dead_it_was_never_alive/,372,372,False,256-384

"Older sources are more canon, not less. And people only think otherwise, due to Capitalist brainwashing. No matter how bad media gets, we as a society have been trained to believe whatever the newest things are is the best. No matter how poorly the newest Call of Duty game is recieved (even among its most die-hard fans), the number of players on its servers will continue to dwarf all of the other CoD games combined. They've somehow convinced everyone that anything that is brand new, is inherently good and valuable for no other reason than being that new.



The definition of the word ""retcon"" has even had to be changed to allow these assumptions. It used to refer to any changes or additions to a lore of any kind, so all prequels were retcons. But the modern use has become ""something that contradicts previous lore- therefore automatically making that prior lore non-canon and this one canon!"" Even though, writers used to call that an ""inconsistency"", which was at least as often considered evidence that this knew something is non-canon, because it doesn't fit what the canon is.



Perhaps I should be going after how objective people treat these standards, as if what you think about a fictional setting could be done in a right or wrong way. But I guess I'm just as bad, because I'm here to say that my unpopular opinion is that you are \*\*all\*\* wrong, and the original source for a setting is entirely canon- every word.

"Green bean casserole and sweet potato with marshmallows are gross With Thanksgiving approaching, small talk often turns to what people are making or looking forward to having on Thanksgiving. These two dishes seem to come up the most. Green beans are one of my favorite vegetables.

Then they are covered in some cheesy slop and topped with the crunchy onion things...why are we ruining green beans? Just make a side of fresh ones, it's a special meal! 

Sweet potatoes are already sweet! Adding sugary goo on top is just pointless and buries the taste of the potato.

"The joker 2 Folie à Deux is a good film thats unfairly judged and criticized Im really stunned because all I heard from people and critics was that this was one of the worst films ever made. Even if someone disliked this film I struggle to see how anyone could rate this as low as a 3/10 or lower (thats the current score on rotten tomatoes). This movie was not slop surprisingly, like i was led to believe. There was actual effort put into this film.

The team had complete creative control over the film, no executives distorting the authors vision for the film.Joaquin phoenix also did a fantastic job just like the first film. The musical aspect of the film was overblown imo. I am not a huge fan of musicals but i think that it really worked well, and i have never seen any other film try something out of the ordinary like this.

If you are someone who enjoys cinema like I do, please give this movie a chance. This is probably the most unfairly rated and underrated films I have ever seen. I dare say its even on par with the first film. Do not listen to the critics and audience scores, watch for yourself and come to your own conclusions.

A large portion of the hate I believe comes from the fact that people were expecting another film similar to the first and then people were upset that it was not what they wanted or were expecting from the sequel.

I will say that I do not think this film is for everyone and Im certain that it was not meant to be. If you prefer predictable safe films which is fine, I do not think that this is for you.

Based on quotes from interviews I have gatherered that Joaquin phoenix really did want to return for a second film, not to do a layup but to do something new and Phillips intentionally went in an opposite direction for the sequel.

"Most TV shows aren't good, we just need to see how it ends I started rewatching Stranger Things the other day since the new season is coming out in a few weeks. My girlfriend convinced me to start it a few years ago (I'm not really a big sci-fi fan) and honestly, it blew my mind. At the time, I thought it was incredibly unique, fun, scary and incredibly emotional. Really one of the few times a TV show ever actually made me tear up.

There was only the 3 seasons out at the time and I must've burned through them in a week. And when it was over and I realized I had to wait another year or so for the next season I literally felt depressed. Cut to a couple days ago where I started it from scratch before the last season. I was honestly pretty shocked how corny I thought it was. So I said to myself alright maybe we dont redo the entire series, maybe just start from season 3. Restarted season 3 and it was the same exact thing. Now I'm not saying its a terrible show at all, I still think its very well made and unique, but I have to admit, I was no where near as in love with it as I was when I first watched it. The dialogue was cheesier, the humor kinda fell flat, the fight scenes were really sorta generic and idk, it just didn't draw me in like last time. So I started think, this wasn't the first time I was absolutely in love with a show for a while, only to rewatch it and think it was actually not that great. My conclusion is...

I think most TV shows are plot forward, so they get a tremendous amount of hype surrounding them for a little while, but once the show concludes, they're pretty quickly forgotten. And I think the best tv shows are character forward, where they're not super plot heavy and don't necessarily leave you on the edge of your seat, but they go so much deeper and are much more memorable/rewatchable.

"Washing meat isn’t a bad practice. My family is Caribbean and so I was raised washing meat, although I am American. I wash meat because it helps clear out the gunk, makes it taste better, and softens the meat.

For example, today I had a cheap supermarket chicken. I spent hours with the frozen chicken removing left over feathers, feather stems, the butt, neck, thick yellow scales off the drumsticks, and spine of the chicken. I then rub the coarse salt to removed the yellow film on the chicken before soaking the chicken with cold water and vinegar. I soak the chicken two more times in cold water to remove the vinegar taste completely.

At this point I’m ready to dry and season the chicken.

Washing chicken is frowned upon because of the risk of spreading salmonella. However, my family and I never had an issue with this. At my parent’s home, we have a separate utility sink used for washing meat. The sink is cleaned with hot soapy water and bleach afterwards.

I live with roommates, and I always make sure the sink is cleared of dishes before washing raw meat. I never touch the facets or random objects. After handling raw meat, I wash everything with soapy water (letting the soap sit) and again with general disinfectant.

The chicken has less of a rank taste, allowing me to enjoy all qualities of chicken on a budget. I also take the time and care to prepare the chicken to remove anything I don’t want from it.

Lastly, washing chicken isn’t done to disinfect chicken. It’s done to improve the taste, remove the slime, and soften the fat and skin. I certainly wouldn’t recommend it to someone unwilling to properly clean their surrounding areas, but I wouldn’t dismiss that washing my chicken makes it more tastier.",reddit_unpopularopinion,post,0,2025-11-15 19:38:50,https://reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/1oy7r9g/washing_meat_isnt_a_bad_practice/,395,395,False,384-512

"It was easier when we had to dress up for work. So in this new world the old way of looking good for work was simply buying dress clothes. And even cheap dress clothes looked good enough.

Casual clothes  on the other hand require a lot more effort and understanding of fashion to pull off a  polished and professional look.

Like I don’t have the money to pay a stylist to figure out what hoodie will make me look like you can trust me with your accounts. 

Edit: I think people aren’t understanding why I think casual is harder than  dressing up. So I will use my work as an example. Ten years ago  my industry was one you dressed up for. Then casual Friday happened. Then dress for your role.

So before clients and management had a very easy to understand expectation of what you would dress like.  I could relocate, I could get promoted but still keep the same wardrobe. And I could dress for the job I wanted  by being a little more polished but still not look out of place in my current role.

Now, changing cities, or in some cases changing streets requires you to change your wardrobe. You have to pay much more attention to the work culture, the changing expectations of clients, and fashion trends.  I would look ridiculous trying to dress like upper management now.  My clients in my current location might like me to be preppy casual, but if I relocate my clients might expect me to be cooler and more edgy. Etc.  Before, the same outfit would have worked across many locations and many departments.

No it’s not impossible to figure out.  But it’s far from easy and if you are ambitious, it’s more expensive than the old dress codes.

People act like a gift is automatically more meaningful just because someone spent hours making it. But the time put in does not magically turn something into a good gift. A simple $10 useful thing usually has more real value than a $10 dessert that is gone the same day or a craft project that ends up collecting dust.

And the idea that if someone does not have money they should still make a physical gift is insane. A genuine hug, or taking a moment to tell someone you care about them means far more than creating something just to fill an obligation.

"Traditional theatre is better than musical theatre I get the appeal of musical theatre, really I do. However, traditional theatre is not only more accessible to actors and performers physically and logistically, but designers can get creative with the staging. This is especially true if you do a Shakespeare play. You can set it in any time period and although the language is archaic, as long as your actions are portraying what you’re saying, the audience will understand. On top of that, I’ve noticed that staging and set designs for plays tend to be more immersive than that of musicals. In musicals, you’re always just watching the performance and almost never are the actors able to use the audience. Sure there are exceptions to that, but you almost never see them. Plays however can use the audience especially if the theatre is a black box type. Last point I want to make is that acting is more accessible as a skill and isn’t as maintenance heavy as singing. With acting, self-maintenance is just your typical self care and immersing yourself in your character and their world. Singing requires constant practice, skill, and maintenance. And let’s not forget dancing. There’s a lot of dancing in musicals typically in conjunction with singing and although there are many people who love musical theatre, not everyone who does can sing or dance well. Also, please go support your local community or professional theatre. The actors, stage crew, and others put countless hours into shows and it would be a shame if their efforts aren’t seen.

"The Super Bowl should be held in college football stadiums, not pro stadiums. In just the last decade, we've had 2 Super Bowls held in the home stadium of one of the teams in the game. Those are Super Bowl 55 in Tampa Bay and Super Bowl 56 in LA. In both games, the home team won. 

  
Holding the Super Bowl in college football stadiums would create a more neutral playing field, as well as greater capacity. MetLife Stadium is the largest NFL stadium, with a capacity of 82,500, whereas the biggest college football stadium is Michigan Stadium with a capacity of 107,601. And yes, I know the Super Bowl would never be held in an open-air stadium in Michigan in February, but still. Some college stadiums that would make sense would be: 

Jordan-Hare in Auburn, AL (88,043)

Even the Alabama teams on here would be a little chilly. But these stadiums have higher capacities than any NFL stadium, which would allow for cheaper tickets as there's more supply.

"Mouses shouldn't have become a standard peripheral My gripe isn't against mouses specifically, but any input method that involves manoeuvring a cursor. What annoys me about it is that it uses real number coordinates to navigate around the screen, which requires a certain degree of dexterity to press buttons and navigate UI. A keyboard key, in contrast, is either pressed or not pressed. On top of this, prolonged mouse use has a much greater probability of causing RSI than just a keyboard. It doesn't help that mouses are often required by software that doesn't implement full keyboard support.

I just like how, on a keyboard, a key is either pressed, or it is not pressed. You don't have an infinite number of positions a cursor can be in. Now, I understand and acknowledge that a mouse IS useful for some things, like creative software that DOES require precise positioning or things like games and so on. My argument is that most productivity software shouldn't use a mouse at all. Or, at least, you should be able to navigate it fully and intuitively with only a keyboard. Keyboard only is both healthier and more efficient.

"D&D is horribly boring. Maybe I’m just playing with the wrong groups, or hell, maybe I’m the problem. But D&D (and TTRPGs in general) are so mind-numbingly boring to me. 

In theory, I really like the idea, and it sounds like so much fun! Sometimes I even get into the flow of the story and roleplaying for a minute there. But the second combat or a dungeon come up, it’s the most boring slog of all time. Hours upon hours to resolve seconds of combat, waiting for people to look up from their phones and figure out what they’re going to do. I’m often the only one paying attention during combat besides the DM, and the endless ritual of rolling dice and adding numbers till the monster dies is so horribly dull. Everyone else at the table seems to be having fun! But for me it’s the most tedious thing imaginable. Dungeon crawling is even worse! I get so agitated every time someone suggests we check each and every cupboard before allowing us to move on to the next room. I get not wanting to miss everything but the DM is obviously looking up loot tables and I want to get to the next story beat before I kill myself out of sheer boredom. Shopping is even worse. 

I’ve played with around five different groups, and everyone I play with seems to really enjoy it, and if anything it seems like the sessions I hate the most are their favorites (and vice versa). I’ve  played a ton of TTRPGs. I’ve had sessions that theoretically seem like I should be having a good time, like a round of Call of Cthulhu where my character wound up being the only one with a gun and single-handedly saved the entire party from hordes of fishmen with ridiculously good rolls one after the other. But even that had me bored to tears. I want to enjoy D&D so badly but it’s genuinely so boring for me.

"Cycling is better than walking or running Cycling is way better than walking or running. I don’t get why people torture themselves when bikes exist.

It’s faster, more efficient, and way easier on your joints. You can cover long distances without feeling completely drained, get places quicker, and still get a solid workout. Plus, its actually fun, wind in your face, sense of freedom, no endless pounding on your knees or feet.

Walking is slow, and running feels like punishment after a while. Meanwhile, cycling gives you speed and endurance without the same level of pain or fatigue.

"Humanities and arts are just as important as science and engineering 
Humanities effectively teach us to live with each other well and make us more empathetic and understanding of one another. Lots of people view humanities as superfluous because they view books/films/music as entertainment, not as enrichment. However, when you tell stories from new perspectives and it resonates with people, they gain a deeper level of empathy and insight. Most people’s worst behaviors come from fear of difference and the unknown

Arts definitely influence people even if people don’t _think_ they do. It’s borderline subconscious. Soft power is so important that our government literally funds it. Entertainment literally directs our culture and policies

[edit] a story I love that demonstrates this. The creators of Coco were pretty sure their movie wouldn't get a release in China because their censorship laws do not allow supernatural beings like ghosts. However, when the censorship board saw Coco, they thought the message was so important, they permitted it despite it being ""against the rules"". Not surprising considering Chinese culture emphasizes the importance of family, and Coco is about exactly that. This kid's movie has shifted China's social policy, even if just a small increemental amount

"Sleeping Dogs is the best ""GTA"" game I have consistently come back to this absolute gem since it's release in 2012. Not only is it the best ""GTA clone"" ever created, I'd argue that it's better than every entry in the GTA franchise. The character development, the perks and upgrades available, the absolute endless fun of the hand to hand combat, the offensive driving (something very few games implement...i.e. ramming, action hijacking etc), the story, the environmental use in combat, the collectables that actually mean something, the outfits that can buff your stats, all of the ultra fun DLC released including super cars and wild outfits that were created..etc etc..Sleeping Dogs in my opinion is the gold standard of what an open world crime game should be and it's a damn shame we'll probably never get a sequel. United Front Games truly created a masterpiece.

"Modern technology and has destroyed the world. Convenience doesn’t equal happiness. I’m aware many people may think I’m stupid for saying this, but I believe that modern technology has destroyed our lives. Yes, everything is more convenient, but at what cost. People argue that the advancements being made in tech will make our lives better because then humans will finally have the free time to discover and create. I’m sorry, what? Discover and create what exactly? I call bs on that argument. Those who are artistically inclined are already discovering and creating, they don’t need freed up time by tech advancements. Plus, people are using modern technology to create garbage that nobody is even interested in. Everyone else is going to turn into lazy doom scrolling zombies, even more so. Just about every job we can think of is being replaced. Jobs in teaching and computer software are in danger of being replaced, I always assumed those jobs were safe. 

Have we become so enticed by the idea of not having to do anything that we are willing to have robots and computers do absolutely everything for us? I’m just wondering, what will our lives look like in the future? We will wake up, our robots will make the bed, make our breakfast, load the dishwasher because we can’t be bothered. Our kids will go to a facility where they stare at a computer screen. We will stay at home and do the same. Our money is numbers on a screen. We try to call tech support or to make an appointment somewhere and we’re not speaking to a person. We’ll only leave the house if we have to, because what’s going to be the point of leaving the house anymore? Maybe we have a doctor’s appointment. When we do leave the house, we’ll enter our self driving cars, more time for doom scrolling. Once we get to a doctor’s appointment, we do a self check in - more screens. Once we finally see the Doc he’ll be asking the chat questions. In the meantime our robots clean the house and prepare dinner. We go home, eat dinner while everyone stares at a screen while the robo maid tidies up.

"Most Popular Horror Movie Villains Are Not Scary IMO, unstoppable entities that just keep coming back through movie tropes are not scary in the slightest. Freddy, Jason, Michael Myers, etc lose their scare factor when in every movie, no matter what the protagonist does, they come back. It erases the stakes, tension, buildup, and grip of the plot. Why the hell would I be invested in a group of people and their grueling fight against a demonic entity, when after hours of intense running and fighting, it just pops up on screen again and/or murders them right before the credits. At least some do it right with prerequisites and end-goals (It Follows, When Evil Lurks, Sinister).

"A lot of modern anime feels like a social skills guide disguised as a story. So, I used to watch a fair share of anime when I was younger, but I've fallen off in recent years. A big reason is that so many shows are set in highschool, and that just gets boring after a while. Anyway, I recently had some free time and decided to dive back in and see what I've been missing.

Putting the highschool setting aside, I couldn't help but notice that a lot of the anime I checked out seem specifically directed at people who have a genuinely hard time integrating into society. A huge proportion of the main characters just never know how to react in any social enviroment. And I get it, I'm not the smoothest talker either, it's normal to be awkward in unfamiliar settings. But these shows take it to such an extreme that even a simple dialogue in a supermarket feels like a Dark Souls boss battle for them.

Then, of course, comes the character development, where the character either learns by themselves or is taught by someone else how to behave in a specific situation. But they always simplify it and spell it out, almost like a guide for the viewer. It feels less like organic storytelling and more like it's trying to educate a particular audience on how to act. Is that good or bad? I think it depends.

I'm somewhat familiar with Japanese sensibilities, and I know it's a more introverted society. But to what exact extent, I think it's hard for me to exactly say unless i would've lived there. So on one hand, I guess it's good if it helps these highly, highly antisocial individuals. But on the other hand, man, it makes these anime feel so dumbed down and boring. For me, it's like the story itself is just a pretext to teach social manners, and once you see this pattern everywhere, it just gets bland. It's like watching highschool anime; you see a couple, but after a point, you've seen them all.

I'm not saying there aren't anime that break this formula, or do not follow it at all. The teaching aspect can be applied to other subjects, like in *Ruri Rocks*, where you get a free geology lesson. But a big portion anime nowadays feels like it just ends up in this type of social-guiding anime. They remind me of the formula for fairy tales for kids.",reddit_unpopularopinion,post,94,2025-11-12 04:35:40,https://reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/1ov0to8/a_lot_of_modern_anime_feels_like_a_social_skills/,586,505,True,512-1K

Corner punchout



Centre punchout

All the new phones have middle punchouts now, and its so weird and odd that people prefer these more. The side punchout is nestled in the corner, nice and snug where no important stuff is displayed.  The middle punchout forces everything downwards, while the side punchout allows for notifications and those icon things to be displayed at the top of the screen. No TV show or YT video has important stuff at the top right and left corners. The punchouts block everything, and ruin the experience of a phone so much for such a tiny thing.

It's characters like Azog, as compared to someone like Lurtz, where the difference is noticeable, in a bad way. Or the goblins vs the Moria orcs. They just look much more fake, and the whole direction of the scenes more video gamey, with little feeling of danger or tension despite the constant action.

>Edit to add more information on what I mean by significant digit:

The more change you get when you modify a digit, the greater it's significance. The 1st digit of YYYY is most significant because a change in that is +/- 1000 years (e.g. 2025 > 3025), where as the 2nd digit of DD is the least significant.

"Do you have a butt? Read this. Every year, thousands of young people hear the words, “You have colorectal cancer” — cancer of the colon or rectum (parts of your digestive system). It’s terrifying. Colorectal cancer is the deadliest cancer in men under 50 and second in young women. But we’d be the assholes if we didn’t tell you the truth: It doesn’t have to be this way.

Colorectal cancer, or CRC, is one of the most preventable cancers with screening and highly treatable if caught early. So why is it upending the lives of so many young people? In a word: *stigma*.

Nobody likes talking about bowel habits, rectal bleeding, or colonoscopies. So… the conversation doesn’t happen. Too many people don’t know the symptoms. Too many symptoms get dismissed by healthcare providers. And too many diagnoses come late.

Advanced colorectal cancer has a survival rate of just 13%. Science still hasn’t broken the code to cure every case of colorectal cancer. That’s why awareness, better screening access, and providers taking symptoms seriously are just as important as knowing the signs yourself.

Here’s what you need to know:

* CRC rates in under‑50s are rising.
* Many are diagnosed in their 20s–40s — often after misdiagnoses.
* A close family member with CRC doubles your risk.
* Lynch syndrome or FAP = even higher risk.
* Screening saves lives, and most people have testing options (including at-home tests). 

So why are *we* talking about this? r/AmItheAsshole is approaching 25 million members. To celebrate, we, the mods, have partnered with the Colorectal Cancer Alliance, a national nonprofit leading the mission to end this disease.

Here’s how you can help:

**1. Learn the symptoms.**

Bleeding, persistent changes in bowel habits, unexplained weight loss, abdominal pain. Don’t ignore them. Advocate for yourself. 

**2. Get checked starting at 45.** 

If you’re average risk, you should start getting checked for CRC at age 45. Some people need to get checked earlier.",reddit_AmItheAsshole,post,22922,2025-09-08 11:01:46,https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1nbq3x2/do_you_have_a_butt_read_this/,647,508,True,512-1K

"AITA for putting on a ""Do Not Disturb"" Sign at my Door? I (25F) work at home for five years and had been supporting my family with my dream job. I pay all the bills consistently and even buy groceries once in a while. I live with my my mom (59F) who's a housewife all her life, and my brother (44M) and SIL who both don't have jobs but does labor work in the house.

My job pays well while I'm at home, and I genuinely like and thrive working in a peaceful setting where I'm not interrupted for eight hours a day, so I confined myself inside my room, which also serves as an office.

My mother is aware that I dislike being bothered, but occasionally she just barges into my room to talk, gossip, do chores, etc., which is really quite distracting and makes it easy for me to lose focus. (I think I got ADHD, but I'm yet to be diagnosed.)

I've recently gotten the idea of making my own ""Do Not Disturb"" sign after my niece had a birthday party in the house. It was noisy, so after interacting and buying the kids snacks, I've locked myself in my room, put on headphones, and became VERY productive with no disturbance at all. The sign I've made says ""do not disturb, please contact me in messenger"" to make sure I'm still accessible when needed during work hours.

The problem: Earlier today, our electric wiring got fixed, which means I cannot work for a few hours with no lights on so I took a nap. When I woke up, I saw my mom messaged me asking me to reimburse her the money she spent for the wiring. When I came out of the room, I asked her if she needed the money now. She replied ""if you please"" in a very rude tone, which took me aback. 

When I returned in my room to resume working now that the lights are back, I can hear her ranting why do I need to lock the door for and that I don't need privacy. I didn't listened further because I am honestly hurt. 

I have nothing but a good daughter for the family. I pay the bills monthly without any help from the family members, they still went ahead to gossip about me just because I've locked the door while working and getting mad for wanting privacy.",reddit_AmItheAsshole,post,2044,2025-11-19 07:18:09,https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1p166an/aita_for_putting_on_a_do_not_disturb_sign_at_my/,540,500,True,512-1K
"AITAH for not renewing my lease with my roommate knowing she faces homelessness with 2 kids? So, my partner and I asked a friend of mine to move in with us because we knew her lease was up at her old place, she had 2 kids (a 1 yr old and a newborn at the time, 2 and 1 yr now) but anyway, we were getting a new apartment and thought it could benefit everyone.

She agreed to pay half the rent, no utilities, and I'd help her with childcare so she could work and not pay ridiculous amounts of money for someone to watch both kids. We just had to work opposite shifts. Sidenote: We got the biggest and most expensive apartment in the complex ONLY because she said she'd pay half and she had 2 kids so we needed the space. We CANNOT afford this place by ourselves. 

After a short while, I ended up having to take a LOA from work because I got hurt and broke some bones. She said she'd pay me to watch her kids so she could take on more hours and my partner said that it that was the case, she only need pay 1/3 of the rent instead of half, still no utilities. 

The problem is that she's only ever paid us the whole of her portion of rent maybe 3 times in 10 months. And she only paid me for my time taking care of the kids for maybe a month or two. 

On top of that, she has mental health issues and as soon as she moved in, stopped taking her meds and lost her insurance after that so she had no access to her medication. She has explosive manic episodes and takes them out on me. Screaming at me, threatening to take her kids (who I love very much), and just leave. Exact quote ""I'll be packing a box of things for a couple of days and the kids and I will be gone by tonight"". That was months ago but it's always stuck with me. 

Well, recently, my partner lost their job and he was the only reason we were able to pay our rent. 

We have a plan and we are okay for the next couple months until our lease is up. But we can't continue to live with someone who cannot pay bills, brings endless streams of drama, and who has outbursts the way she does.",reddit_AmItheAsshole,post,646,2025-11-19 12:11:19,https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1p1dg0m/aitah_for_not_renewing_my_lease_with_my_roommate/,730,489,True,512-1K

"AITA because I didn’t take a co worker to the airport? Just started a new job working 3 weeks on and 3 weeks off.  This is my first time working for 3 weeks straight.  I live around 2 hours from the job while my co workers could be anywhere in the US so most of them fly in.  About a week and a half a guy I never met comes joins the crew.  He was a chain smoker.  At the end of the 3 weeks I was asked i could drop him off at the airport because he knew i drove to the location.  I told him no I couldn’t and walked to my car and left.  The reasons why I didn’t want to was because he smelted like cigarettes and cigars and I didn’t want my car to smell
Like that and also I don’t want to be known as the guy who takes people to the airport before I leave.  Now I heard that people know i didn’t drop him off and he doesn’t like me.  I feel that I had the right to refuse to drop him off but AITA?

"AITAH if I tell my parent that they need to give me a timeframe for them to move out of my house Hey guys, 

Looking for some input here. 

My mother moved into a guest room nearly two years ago after a divorce led to her losing her housing. 

The intention was for her to stay with me while she receives the necessary surgeries to try to get back into the workforce, so initially, the deal was presented to me as her staying with me for 
""a couple of years"" until she finds a housing accomodation"". 

After her surgeries, she is still disabled and is still not able to work and has not made any efforts to find new housing. They receive around $2k a month in benefits and there's a potential they could apply for vouchers, but they seem unwilling to move to a less desirable area and have dogs that would probably need a fenced in yard. 

Am I the asshole for telling her that I would like her to find somewhere else to go in the next 12-18 months?

My brother seems to think I'm being way too harsh and that ""Well, I should have known"" and ""Well, this is the situation we are in"", followed up with concerns that I am going to kick my disabled parent out on the street. The brother does not own a house and I'm hoping that this might light a fire under everyone's asses to get their shit together.  My brother has a lot of sacrifices they can make to try to save more money. 

It's putting stress on my relationship with my significant other of 10 years and I don't think my mother has even tried to find a place to go. I have only discussed this with my brother and have not brought it up otherwise.

"AITA for Embarrassing a Man at a Party (and Upsetting my Friend)? Recently, I went to a party with a friend, I’ll call her L, where I didn’t know anyone else but her. Usually, that would be an absolute no for me but she really likes a guy (let’s call him J) who was going so after some begging, I agreed.

While she was talking to the guy she likes, a man started a to talk to me. It turns out, this was the host of the party and a close friend of J but I didn’t know this at the time. He asked what I do for a living and I said that I have an art business. 

Without asking any follow-up questions, he immediately started talking about how if “I’m not harnessing the power of social media” my business is doomed to fail. The thing is, I get all my business through social media and have almost 300k followers across different apps. 

I tried to explain that I do use social media but he cut me off. He went into a rant about how he has a very successful Instagram account and how I am probably following wrong and outdated advice. He went on and on about content strategies, SEO, and everything else, which I all know about and use successfully. I know I should have probably stopped him there but he really wasn’t giving me time to reply to anything he was saying.

By the end of his almost 10 minute rant (it probably wasn’t THAT long but it sure felt like it), a few other people nearby were also listening. At this point I was annoyed so I asked him, “if you are so successful, could I see your instagram page so I can learn some more tips?” 

His account had around 20k followers. He told me to show him my account, and if “I have potential,” he can take me out for dinner and “teach me his secrets.” I showed my Instagram account, which has over 150k followers. A couple of people around asked to see and were complimenting my work. Some of them laughed when they saw the difference in followers between us. 

He mumbled something (I couldn’t hear) and walked away, mad and embarrassed. He went  to L and J.",reddit_AmItheAsshole,post,125,2025-11-19 14:05:06,https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1p1gm2b/aita_for_embarrassing_a_man_at_a_party_and/,771,505,True,512-1K
"AITA: My potential mother in law got arrested and I couldve prevented it but I didnt. 



AITA: OK let's get a few things out of the way first. This happened a couple months ago with my now ex and her family. There are many different things that I could post to this subreddit about this relationship but I will try to contain myself to this incident. 

I (25M) was at home in the wee hrs of the morning. I think it was like 1 or 2 am. I had worked nights so i was still up watching a movie as i was going to bed. I got a call from my then gf saying that her, her mom , brother and sister had been pulled over by the cops. I come to find out it had something to do with their tag being expired. Which btw they foolishly had been driving around with the last couple days and they knew it. In doing so they found out that the mom had a warrant for like skipping traffic court or something like that, I dont quite remember. Thus the penalty was they were going to impound the car and arrest the mom, i think the jail sentence was like 7 days. So, they called me to see if I would come down (it was abt a 20 min drive). Their plan was for me to jump in their car and drive it off so no one would get arrested and no car would be impounded. Now there is one thing that needs to be known abt me. I have pretty serious anxiety and it had been getting pretty bad as of late. I did not like to drive alone or anywhere that was any further than my neighborhood. They knew that ofc and even offered to get me an uber to them and then they said all I had to do was slightly drive away and the mom would get back behind the wheel to drive home. Besides the fact that all of this was highly illegal, I was not comfortable with any of it. I hated to see them go thru this, but like I said it was already very late and my anxiety was already starting to kick in. In addition, all of this could have been solved by any one of the children driving the car, but for reasons unknown to me none of them had drivers licenses even tho they were all eligible.",reddit_AmItheAsshole,post,149,2025-11-19 11:05:24,https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1p1bn4g/aita_my_potential_mother_in_law_got_arrested_and/,558,472,True,512-1K

"AITA for snapping at my boyfriend's mom for cleaning our entire apartment while we were asleep? Me (21F) and my bf (21M) have been living together for 5 months. He wanted to live in a studio, but his mom is paying his rent and she wanted him to be in a one bedroom so she could come visit and stay for our college football game weekends. I pay half the rent.  
My bf was away on internship on our move in day, and I ended up moving both of us in, with help from his mom. After we moved all the boxes in, I had to leave for a few days, and I told her to not unpack anything. I like unpacking, and I didn't want her going through my things. When I came back, every. single. box. was unpacked and organized, including my clothes, my razors etc. Also, a lot of furniture and decorations that I had vetoed were set up. I saw this as a huge violation, but kinda just took a deep breath and blew it off. My bf has said that she has a poor understanding of personal space, and has always been too involved in his life, which he has learned to live with.(He is an only child... I grew up with 10 siblings. Lol)  
She has come to visit a few times and has cleaned our apartment almost every time she comes. I have told her several times that there is no need, and even had to put a very hard boundary on her not washing our sheets or touching my clothes, since that feels like a massive breach of my privacy. My bf doesnt understand why I'm upset but has been on my side.

Last weekend she visited, we set the couch for her and we hung out after the game. The next morning, we woke up to her cleaning our place. She had been cleaning for 2 hours while we were asleep. I was pretty upset and my bf went to go talk to her. He said that she moves all of our things around and we can never find anything when shes done.

"AITA for not wanting a photographer present when I propose? I'm proposing soon, my girlfriend is semi-aware of it (we've been talking pretty seriously about marriage for the past year) but she doesn't know when or how I'm planning on doing it. Recently, the topic came up between us and a mutual friend of ours, and I mentioned not liking the idea of having a photographer present to capture the moment of the engagement. My girlfriend said she would like a photographer, likely dropping a hint, and I kind of shrugged it off.

Later on, our mutual friend asked me if I was going to change my mind and get a photographer and I said no. I don't want to alter the plan I already have, I don't want to further complicate the already expensive and elaborate plan I've come up with, and I really REALLY don't want a photographer. She seemed mad about this, saying I should think what my girlfriend would want and I got kind of mad. I'm already doing a lot for her here, paying for a ring and a well thought-out date on a trip out of town. Implying that I'm not taking her into consideration felt kind of insulting to me.

I explained to her that the wedding will have tons of photographers and people present, and that the proposal is the one thing that can be private and intimate and free of performance and without an audience. I want it to be *our moment* and if that means not having a photographer capturing the exact second she reacts to it, that's fine. It is very emotionally important to me that the moment be private. Considering all the things I'm doing for her here (the trip, the date, the ring, the whole plan), I think it's reasonable to allow myself just *one thing* for my own sake and do that my way even if my girlfriend wants otherwise.

My friend retorted, saying that because I have a bigger family and more friends than my girlfriend, that the wedding would therefore be about me, so the proposal should be for my girlfriend's sake and every single thing should be done exactly the way she would want it.",reddit_AmItheAsshole,post,35,2025-11-19 15:24:26,https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1p1iqzs/aita_for_not_wanting_a_photographer_present_when/,664,441,True,512-1K
"AITA/Bridezilla for wanting both of my parents to walk me down the isle? I F29 am getting married in 2026. For months I have said that I want both of my parents to walk me down the aisle. Now that more wedding planning is happening, my dad brought it up again. 

I explained that I want both of them to meet me at the entrance, walk me halfway together. Break off with hugs one at a time and walk to their seats ahead of me. Then I finish on my own. This feels meaningful to me because it honors both of them and also reflects my independence.
My dad, my mom, and my fiancé all pushed back. My mom said it is not traditional (EDIT: my mom felt honored that I asked and said yes initially before falling back on tradition) My fiancé said I am not being sensitive to my dad (we aren’t close anymore, see comments for a lil more background on finances concerns). My dad kept saying that tradition gives the father this role.

Here some background info. My parents divorced this year. They both had their reasons, but my dad became very difficult during the process. He was the one telling everyone he wanted a divorce two years ago, yet now he behaves in ways that do not feel familiar. When I was younger he was a good father but not always a good partner. In recent years he has turned into the type of man he used to warn me and my sisters about (instances of financial infidelity, emotional infidelity and refusal to seek counseling) Because of all of this I have stepped back from him.

Even with these changes, I still want to honor him. I also want to honor my mom equally. Traditional aisle walks favor the father andthe mother assist with some of the wedding rituals. None of which I plan on doing. I do not want her to feel like a background figure. She raised me too and I want her included in the moment.

The idea of stopping halfway is also important to me. It represents the years when I grew into my own life, moved out, and found my own peace.

When I explained all of this and said it is my wedding and I want both of them involved, I was told I am being selfish and acting like a bridezilla. I do not feel that way. My only firm requests are this aisle plan and toilet seat covers in the bathrooms.",reddit_AmItheAsshole,post,24,2025-11-19 15:39:43,https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1p1j5i1/aitabridezilla_for_wanting_both_of_my_parents_to/,790,500,True,512-1K
"AITA For paying the installer directly? AITH? 

This is long. 

I hired an online mom friend's boyfriend “C” to do some handyman work for me. First project, replacing toilets, went fine. The second project is removing my broken floating kitchen floor and replacing it with vinyl plank that I already purchased.  He tells me he doesn't do flooring but he's got a guy who does, so he'll hire him and be his helper. Cool. He sends me a quote that I agree to. We plan for Saturday from 10-12 arrival time. He asked to be paid up front so he can get supplies. I told him I'd pay half and the rest on Saturday. Saturday morning at 10am, he rescheduled to Sunday. At this point I have zero information on how long this is going to take, etc. 

Sunday, two guys “N” and his helper “W” show up at my door to do this work. C is nowhere to be found. After about 5 hours N tells me he's on call at his regular job and needs to leave, but he'd be back that night to finish laying the floor. He calls me a few hours later to apologize, he got stuck at work and he can't make it back,  but he'd be back Monday night to finish it. Monday morning I confirm with C that N is coming back around 5:30. I left work early to be home.  7:45pm rolls around and I haven't heard anything from anyone.  I figure N is the one doing the work and I'd likely get a response direct from the source faster than going through C, so I text N asking for an ETA. He says C told him he was getting someone else to finish it so it could just be done faster, so he was under the impression that it was handled. I told him no,  it's in the exact same place it was when he left (exposed glue, etc, I have cats that can't be walking on it).  He apologizes profusely and tells me we can discuss having him finish the job. 15 minutes later (8pm) I text C asking him to call me.  Less than a minute later N calls and he's not happy.",reddit_AmItheAsshole,post,69,2025-11-19 09:05:12,https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1p18ju8/aita_for_paying_the_installer_directly/,751,482,True,512-1K
AITA for not wanting guests in the dorm when I'm there? My roomate had a guy over for a hw night. I got to the dorm and she didn't ask him to leave. I was hanging on my bed and he was there for another two hours with me in the room. He finally left at around 12 AM. I was uncomfortable but didn't feel comfortable kicking him out myself A couple days later they're at the dorm again. I tell my roomate at midnight that I'm really sleepy and asked when they would be done. She said that they won't be done for another half hour. He ended up leaving the dorm at 1 AM. I'm frustrated because he has his own house and there are multiple buildings they can be in on campus to do their hw together. She got upset at me for not letting her know when I had a friend over at a time where she's normally in class. And my friend was there only for a few mins. Meanwhile she has him there for hours and doesn't tell me in advance.

"AITA for not wanting to buy a friend’s parents’ home? Me and my spouse are in our early 30s and currently house-hunting new builds. A friend (Nat) heard about this and messaged us saying it’s perfect that we’re in the market because their parents are moving to their homeland and are looking for buyers. I politely declined and said we’ve got our eyes set on new builds. Nat, then, got defensive, stated that his parents’ 2-story home is beautiful and continued to list all the pros individually. All of which are true. I responded and said (1) we want to be the first home owners 🤷🏻‍♀️ , (2) we only want to remodel/make changes once (in our late 50s, right before retirement age), (3) we specifically wanted a single story home because this will be a forever home and don’t want stairs in our old age, (4) new builds we’re looking at and his parents’ house are the same price (though their home is WAY bigger) - and that’s without updating this and that to make their home our home, (5) the home was built in 1950s so foundations, pipes, etc are all questionable to us at this point. But Nat focused on that last line (questionable) and is now calling us AHs and people like us are the reason why his parents’ house has been in the market for more than 90 days “but new builds are being reserved and purchased left and right.” I don’t think we’re the AHs but another friend said “he does have a point.” This friend doesn’t necessarily think we’re AHs but telling us “he has a point” started to make me question our intentions.

"AITA for wanting to make a new password I moved into my girlfriend’s house with her kids about a month and a half ago. We both have some of our own streaming services, and it’s dumb to both be paying for them. She also has a lot of stuff she’s paying for and not using, so last night after dinner, we decided to sit down and cancel the unused and merge the used services. 

She cancelled her subscription to a streaming bundle that I have, and we’re moving onto cancelling something else. In the meantime while she was pulling that up, I was like let me just change the password to a common password since I use this same one for a lot of my important stuff like banking etc. 

She immediately got defensive, telling me I’m being annoying, asking why I need to change it, etc. I’m explaining to her that it’s a password I use for banking and other things and prefer to just have a common password for the streaming stuff. 

She claims that I’m saying I can’t trust her and her kids, starts throwing accusations that I’m suggesting they’d do something nefarious etc, and I’m trying to explain it has nothing to do with that, she’s putting those words into my mouth, and that I feel like this is a pretty normal thing considering it’s a sensitive password that now multiple people will know. 

She said if it was a brand new account it would make sense I use a different password but since it already exists, that’s just weird and I’m saying I can’t trust them etc. Meanwhile, this is all happening right in front of her daughter, so I’m doubly uncomfortable. 

Keep in mind, I’ve given her my credit card to go off and get gas, she drives my car whenever she wants, etc so claiming I “don’t trust her” is absurd to me. She even said something to the effect of “I somewhat understand because xxx is a teenager, but still”

"AITA Family Holiday Dilemma I need someone to be honest with me if I’m being an asshole.

My bf 27M and I 26F have been dating 4 years now. Yesterday he tells me that his grandparents have invited him (and his entire family, uncles, cousins, etc.) to their house (4 hr flight away) for a family reunion of sorts from Christmas thru New Years. 

Let me clarify that I think this is a great idea since his grandfather & uncle passed about a year ago. His family is very sweet and I’ve been very fortunate to get to meet them and see them on several occasions.

The issue w/my bf arose because I asked if I would be going with him to this family event, to which he responded maybe and that he would have to ask his grandma. (accommodations r not a concern because the house is like 10,000 square ft no joke lol)

For context I don’t have any family. My bf IS my family (we live together, have a cat, combine finances etc). When I asked him what he would do if she says I can’t come with him, he responded he was still going to go and I would just have to stay at our place by myself the remainder of that holiday week.

Maybe I’m overreacting but this really hurt me. I love his family and want him to be able to see them but the fact he would leave me alone through the holidays to go to the family reunion felt like a betrayal. I guess maybe I’m the idiot because if the roles were reversed I would stay with him instead of going to see my family….

Please tell me if I’m seeing this situation incorrectly. I’m not trying to make him choose between his family and me but I can’t help but feel hurt over this.

"AITA for setting boundaries with my family when they talk about my weight for context, i've recently been working hard to be more healthy and fit. i've been eating less and working out more, which resulted in me losing weight. i used to be skinny fat months ago, but now i'm getting more lean and really seeing big progress.

my family, especially my mother and sister, have always liked talking about people's weight, especially within the family. it can consist of both positive and negative comments, depending on if you're fat or fit. they always feel the need to point out something about it.

months ago, before my weight loss journey, my mom would always tell me that i'm getting fat or that i needed to lose weight. but now that i'm more active and committed to my weight loss journey, she has only been complimenting me.

today, my sister told me my face has gotten rounder, which obviously pissed me off cuz literally just a DAY before that, she complimented me and told me i look nice. like wow, WHEN is my body image gonna be good enough for you 😭 like when am i gonna get it right, holy shit ???

so obviously i snapped, not just because of what she said, but also because of multiple other instances in the past where my body image got picked apart by my family despite me actually looking pretty healthy and just right for my age and height.

i told her something along the lines of ""please don't talk about my body again. i worked hard to lose all this weight. remember when our aunt talked about your weight too, and you cried? so why are you doing the exact same thing to me? if you have insecurities about your body, don't project that onto me.""

and she went absolutely crazy, screaming and crying. telling me i was being too sensitive, when really i just made it clear that i didn't like her talking about my body. though i think what really set her off was that i told her she has insecurities about her body and when she broke down, she kept on denying it.",reddit_AmItheAsshole,post,41,2025-11-19 07:14:00,https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1p163ez/aita_for_setting_boundaries_with_my_family_when/,738,440,True,512-1K
"AITA for asking an electrician to open my water bottle? We had an electrician over at our house to fix some wiring issues, I try to stay out of the way of workers because I’m sure most people aren’t super interested in small talk on the job. However the electrician was very friendly and he did initiate some small talk as he got to work. I then left him alone to work in peace, and went about my day cleaning. I drink a lot of water but due to a condition I have that affects my joints and muscles, I struggle with a lot of “easy” tasks. 

I could not for the life of me get my Stanley cup open to put more ice water in it. I tried for ten minutes, using all the tricks I could think of, and couldn’t get it. Usually my husband does a lot of things for me, and since the electrician had mentioned his wife and 4 daughters in the one conversation we did have, I thought he might understand, he was about the same age as my dad and reminded me a lot of him, so I just felt like he gave off dad vibes and wouldn’t mind. I asked him if he wouldn’t mind opening it for me, he laughed heartily and said something to the extent of “yeah no problem, these things are such a pain in the butt!” He opened it easily, I thanked him, and that was pretty much the end of our entire exchange until he was done. 

Later that night I laughed about it to my husband, about how I had had to ask the electrician for help getting my water bottle open because it was stuck again. He got really irritated with me, and said it was rude and out of line to ask a worker to do “unpaid labor” like that, and I was basically an inconsiderate AH for asking him. I told him the electrician thought it was funny, and didn’t mind doing it, but he said just because he was polite doesn’t mean he wasn’t mad, and that he was just being professional

Was I an AH for that? I won’t do it again, because I didn’t think about them being hired to do a job and feeling like they can’t decline something like that even if they wanted to.",reddit_AmItheAsshole,post,12,2025-11-19 14:12:36,https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1p1gtcc/aita_for_asking_an_electrician_to_open_my_water/,770,498,True,512-1K
"AITA for the way I have been reacting... So I 36F moved back in with my mom 61F & brother 31M months ago. For context we're all on the deed, I don't consider myself a guest in this house, I consider myself 1/3 owner. 

They've lost the keys, We exclusively use the garage to go in/out. Apparently its too expensive for them to replace the locks & they refuse to deal w/ multiple keys, I offered to replace them.

Several times a week I am locked out & can only get into the garage. I broke my back in 2014, it fucks with my bladder, my family knows this & have been asked many times don't lock the inside garage door until I'm home. Yet several times a week I get home & I find the door has been locked, always by my (super paranoid, thats another subreddit) brother, he locks it as soon as he gets home, sometimes my mom catches it & unlocks it before I get home & sometimes she doesn't. 

When it first happened I brought it up to both of them, I reminded them I usually have to go really bad when I get home, even after going before leaving. It sucks. Its much like the scene in White Chicks after he eats the quiche but I gotta pee. He said he would \*try\* to remember.

So when I get home & I find the door is locked (9mos now & he still can't remember) I feel like its disrespectful, like I fucking said ""If the door is locked & I have to go, in the time it takes for one of you to come open it, I may very well piss my pants"", so it feels like he doesn't give a shit if I have something so disgusting happen. There have been a few times where I have & it was enough I had to change. 

Secondly, I'm on the deed why am I having to knock & wait at a door like a fucking pizza delivery driver? Growing up I had a house key since I was 10, so what is this shit?

Anyway, heres where I may be the asshole..

"WIBTA for retracting an offer for a friend to stay with us A couple of months ago, a family friend asked if she could stay with my husband and I (28 M&F) for a few days before and after Christmas, because our house is convenient to the airport. I’ll call this friend “Ann,” and she’s in her 60s. Initially we said yes, but we’d like to retract because of some intervening circumstances. 

My MIL has been friends with Ann for almost 30 years. Through a combo of bad luck and bad decisions, Ann has no savings or retirement. Her only asset is a house, with a mortgage. My MIL has helped her out over the years with credit card payments and co-signs on leases and loans. Last winter, Ann even moved in with my MIL so she could rent out her own house for income. This seemed like a symbiotic solution at first, because my MIL is going through a tough divorce. 

Two weeks ago, MIL told us that she’s starting to feel used. In two separate but related conversations, my MIL told Ann (1) that she could no longer provide direct financial assistance to her, and a few days later that (2) she and her ex had decided it was best for them to sell their home instead of one of them keeping it, and Ann would have to find a new living situation when they sold. Ann was, I think understandably, stressed out by this but she handled it badly, and exacerbated my MIL’s feelings of being used. 

Here’s where my husband and I come into the conflict. After years of school and internships, I recently started a high-paying job as a corporate real estate attorney. After the convo with my MIL, Ann asked me if I knew any lawyers who could help her with evicting her tenant (long story) for free. I said I didn’t, but offered several low-cost or free legal services she could try to utilize. Ann didn’t like this response and was very negative about each option, continuously stating that she didn’t have the resources she needed and needed help, even though I had recommended several resources that *could* help her. Later, when I showed the texts to my husband, he thought these texts were a veiled request for money. Re-reading them, it does kind of seem that way.",reddit_AmItheAsshole,post,17,2025-11-19 11:38:59,https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1p1ck5n/wibta_for_retracting_an_offer_for_a_friend_to/,616,506,True,512-1K

"AITA for not babysitting my 2 siblings during my mom honeymoon Edit: I am completly grateful with all the advice people are giving me, and the support they are showing. If you are reading this and left a comment, or if you are simply reading, Thank you! It's heartwarming seeing all the comments, I never thought my situation would bring this much support!


Okay, I don’t think I am the asshole but everyone is telling me I am so i need extra points of view here.

I am 17 and i just started university. My mom married ”Marcus” one month ago and she is going on her honeymoon this month. The duration is 4 days. I am the older sister, i have 2 siblings one with 12y and other with 4. And my mother told me I would have to babysit them while she and her husband are in their honeymoon.

I’ve always babysat them in the afternoon since both my mom and Marcus work. But i can only babysit them after 3pm, cause of my classes. I told them they would have to get a babysitter for the morning because the 12 is in school already but the 4 year old isn't, and i cant just miss 4 entire days of classes to stay with him.

She said she can’t do that because they spent a lot of money on this honeymoon and the wedding and they are also paying a loan they used to buy a land to build a house. I told her, that I really can’t miss this classes, I study medicine so watching the classes is extremely important, not to mention I have practice classes which i have a limited amount of times i can’t miss. She insisted saying it was a one time thing and that “she can’t have anything”. Marcus said i had this responsibility since I’m their older sister. 

I refused, and they are telling everyone about it, and everyone is taking their side. I don’t get it? Am I being selfish here? I have classes from 9am to 3pm almost everyday. The 12y enters school at 8:15 so i can drop him off. But i cant leave the 4y alone and i can’t also stay home to be with him.

"AITAH for not picking up my adult sister from work when my parents couldn’t? So this happened a few months ago, but it got brought back up recently and I want to see what you all think.
I (22F) am in college and I also work. Because of this I still live at home with my family so I can save while I’m in school, but I still work to support basic needs (my own food, gas, clothes) as well as my car payments. My car is definitely my biggest expense as it’s completely my own car, not a family car, not a car my parents help me to fund, aside from being included on a family insurance plan rather than being on an independent plan cause it makes it cheaper for all of us, my parents have no right to my car. 
My sister (19F) does not have a car because my parents borrowed a lot of money she was going to use for a car. They try to compensate by driving her to work whenever they can, I also take her to work and to errands a lot because I get what it’s like to be stuck and I just want to help.

At the time, my family was about to make a big cross country move in just a couple months so I was spending a lot of time with friends, having plans with my best friend that night. As we were chilling out, watching some bucket list movies, we were having some drinks too. My mom called me to tell me that our fridge had broken and she and my father needed to go get another before things went bad and said if my sister can’t get a coworker to take her home, I needed to. As I was drinking I already knew I couldn’t, but I told my mom I couldn’t because it would be unfair for me to cancel on my friend. Her tone shifted immediately and she hit me with a “let me rephrase, you WILL pick up your sister if she can’t have a coworker take her home”. I was honestly shocked because up to this point, I had never denied giving my sister a ride.

"AITA for being an inconsiderate roommate? For context, I am F18 freshmen college student and I'm living on-campus rooming with another F18 in a double. In the beginning I struggled to share my space because I was fortunate enough to have my own room so, it took time for me to get used to living with another person. I didn't have anything against her until I found out she had been talking about me to other about things she is annoyed by, like alarm going off or guests, etc. When I found out that from another person, I lost the respect we agreed upon in the beginning of communicating if we have a problem. So, like when I do have a problem, I don't say anything and just ramble to my friends to reciprocate the same energy. However, I believe because I grew up with a sibling and in not the wealthiest household, I am more accepting of smaller things that are a bother as a opposed to making a big problem. Yet, with her, she is very particular about certain things and has mostly made the rules for the room that we share but also goes to bed earlier than I do, which is something I already mentioned and is something we agreed upon before becoming roommates. 

Anyways, the point is, recently I've been staying up later, like not as late as 1:30-2, but around 12:30, to catch up with some old friends, whether that is online or with facetime. And, when I was on call yesterday, she said, ""Since it's Tuesday can you be off the call by 12?"", it was 11:30 then, and I understand it's late, however, I'm not loud or obnoxious when I'm on call when she is also in the room and I allow her to have a noise machine to help her sleep, while I decide to sleep with headphones on to block out noise. In a way, it made me think there was some underlying reason behind why she said it, because it felt passive aggressive when she said it. I'm not trying to be unreasonable, but she could also use her own headphones when going to bed if it seems like I'm staying up late, because that's what I would do if I was in that position.",reddit_AmItheAsshole,post,7,2025-11-19 12:42:15,https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1p1eah9/aita_for_being_an_inconsiderate_roommate/,551,465,True,512-1K
"WIBTA if I told my neighbor I don’t want their kids on my property? I’m 33F, so I’m wondering if I’m just an old man yelling at clouds at this point. This is a long one due to my adding context, so TLDR at the end.

Where I live, I have a busy road in front of my house, and a big oval alley behind with a few houses. In the alley directly behind my house is my neighbor, Jack. Jack is in 60s and his adult son, Art, daughter in law and their kids have moved into Jack’s house. 

Art has 5 children: 2 boys, 3 girls all in different ages, but definitely ranging from 5 to 13. I think only the 2 boys are Art’s biological children, and I mention this because the kids in question are only the girls. I’ve never seen Art redirect or discipline the girls. Unlike the boys, who Art usually steps in to parent and is more hands on. I’m not sure though.

I don’t know the wife’s name, or anything about her, but she really rubs me the wrong way. Aside from Wife being a bad dog owner, her girls are a handful. They run around the alley screaming and yelling, run through everyone’s yards, touching things in those yards. I’m all about kids having space to exist, but I think a lot of that involves being respectful and responsible. 

They do not have permission to run amuck in my yard, or anywhere on my property. Neither I nor my husband have been asked or approached about permission. 

Back on Halloween, it got dark and Art’s family congregated in front of my house on the busy road side. No big deal, it was dark and my porch light was bright enough to make it a safe place. Until Wife told her girls to run through my yard back to their house.

"AITA for lying to my dad about not having dessert left? So me (18M) and my dad (58M) have always had a rocky relationship, and part of that is because of his poor hygiene and lack of consideration for others. My mom (56F) works out of town and is only home for three days a week (friday, saturday, sunday) and when she is home the chores and cooking is split 50/50 between us. My dad and mom were both in the millitary and retired at the same time 12 years ago but my mom kept working and has been working at the same place for about 10 years, never home on weekdays. My grandma lives with us and when mom isnt home its completely my job to take care of her, cook and clean. This is difficult for me as i am studying for university exams (Yks turkish exam) and in cram school for 12 hours a day. My dad does absolutely nothing to help. 

My dad eats a lot. He is always awake the whole night digging through the fridge. He also had a heart attack because of his weight two years ago and we beg him to eat normally but he thinks any advice is disrespect. Its to the point where some days me and my grandma dont even have anything to eat despite me cooking the food because my dad eats most of it and even when he doesnt eat everything he gets defensive over the food left saying we caused his heart attack because we make him angry so we should at least let him have something to eat. 

My mom made a cake on sunday before going to work for us all to eat throughout the week, on tuesday i saw most of the cake was gone, only two slices worth left and so i put it in a container and hid it in my room. My dad was out at this time and when he came back he kept asking everyone if there was any cake left and i lied and said no. When i went into the shower an hour later he rummaged through my room, found it and scolded me about lying and disrespecting him and i just couldn’t take it anymore so i told him how we were all sick of working our asses off just to feed him and starve.",reddit_AmItheAsshole,post,6,2025-11-19 12:56:02,https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1p1enre/aita_for_lying_to_my_dad_about_not_having_dessert/,701,462,True,512-1K
"AITA for having a date over with roomates  I (22F) live with 2 roomates (20F and 28M couple, Jane and Mark) For refrence, I only use 1 of 4 bedrooms in the house. (I dont use common areas at all)  I pay 600/2400 rent (25% of the rent) and im on the lease myself, no subleasing. 
I have been talking with this guy (24M) since May of this year. Jane and Mark were aware that we've been talking. 

I had made plans for a small date night, I was going to make dinner then we would have gone to my room to watch a movie. I asked Jane about having this date 2 weeks before it actually happened, and she said it was okay. 

I checked in with her again a week before, as I and wanted to make sure they were okay with guests. I checked in with her again 2 days before, then the day of. All of which she responded yes to. 

The day comes, and he is scheduled to come over at 630. Jane then texts me this: (Copied directly from texts) 

JANE- ""My mistake man I wasnt thinking about it, is it alright if he leaves when I go to bed, with being up so early I wasn’t thinking about the new schedule of being up at 3:30 am."" 

This was my response:

ME- ""not this time,  we've had these plans for over a week now, and with the time we'd barely even have time to eat together. We wont be a bother. I understand you work early and im sorry your schedule changed, but I also have a life and plans that sometimes are not able to cater to your schedule.""

She ended up not responding to that message. Instead, Her boyfriend/other roomate Mark texted me. copy/paste texts here, so everyone has a full story:

"AITA for criticising my neighbour for having her valuables stolen by leaving them unattended and unsecured for over a week? Hi, so I live in a house opposite a shared one - you know a student house made up of randoms the local university has allocated to it. Made pleasantries with a girl who moved in in the fall,  usually just ""hey"" and a lil wave when we see each other as we are going in and out of our driveways.

I went 2/3 weeks without seeing her - thought nothing of it. Then I bump into her at the local shop. She says she's come back from being at her parents for a couple of weeks and she arrived back here to her room being taken of valuables. My first thought was someone kicked her bedroom door in, but she says she left it unlocked. She said the other sharers had had a party and these other random party people must have snuck in and took stuff. I blurted out why didn't you lock your door, in a tone that was probably a bit too incredulous. She gasped and went I'm so sorry you don't trust anyone and stormed off.

"AITA for ""blocking the path"" on the train? So my friend and I were coming back late from the downtown area of my city and decided to take the train back. The train at night can sometimes be a bit weird, not dangerous but you're able to meet some interesting people at the time of day. Anyway we decided to take the train back because we wanted to save money and thought it'd be okay. Fast forward to us getting on the train and deciding not to sit down because we felt like standing and just felt that if there were other people who wanted to sit they should be sitting first since we were able bodied enough to stand.

Couple stops later this women gets on and is eyeing us down. After the doors closed she walked up to us and casually pushes my friend and I and went to sit down. I was honestly a bit annoyed that she didn't say sorry but just moved on from it until she looked at me and said sit down you're creating a ""fire hazard"". I was confused  and asked her how i was creating a fire hazard when there was so much space around me. She said that in the case there's more people it would create a larger open path so that people could exit quickly. 

I told her that there was no people around and that the train was basically empty but she stood firm and says that we were being rude and inconsiderate. I then lost it and told her that if anyone was ""inconsiderate"" it was her for purposefully barging into us without saying sorry just because she had her ""feeling hurt"". She proceeded to call the emergency line on the train and had the conductor come over who then waived her off and basically told her that it didn't matter.

She got off the train in a huff and was unhappy with everything. AITAH for creating a ""fire hazard""?",reddit_AmItheAsshole,post,7,2025-11-19 12:26:56,https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1p1dvgv/aita_for_blocking_the_path_on_the_train/,385,385,False,384-512

"AITA for Misunderstanding Where to Meet My GF After Our Flight? My girlfriend and I were traveling home after a trip across the US. I splurged and bought first class airfare. We had a tight time to make our connection in Dallas to change planes. I had an upset stomach that day and the previous day which made me need to go to the toilet frequently.  As the plane stopped at the gate and they let people off the plane, I got her bag down from the overhead bin and put it in my seat. She did not get up and said to me, “I’ll meet you at the gate.”  I said okay and left the plane.

I bolted toward the toilet as soon as I was in the terminal. There was a long line at the restroom, and I waited a minute or two but I was out of time to make the connection. Once at the gate, the plane was already boarded and there was no sign of the girlfriend. I wasn’t sure if she had gotten there first after my useless stop at the restroom. So I went on into the jet bridge. There were a few people in there are still waiting to get on the airplane. Within a minute, I looked back and the girlfriend was also in the line waiting to get on the plane. She was no more than three or four people behind me.

I got onto the plane and put my bag in the overhead bin and waited there until she came in. I tried to put her bag in the overhead bin as I normally do and she refused to let me do that. Then she sat in her seat and said tersely that she couldn’t believe I left her.  I asked what did she mean by that? She repeated that she couldn’t believe anyone would just leave someone like that. She was very angry. I said that she had told me to meet her at the gate. She said that meant the gate from the previous flight and not the gate for the next flight. I tried to explain the bathroom situation and that I’ve never heard someone say “meet me at the gate” means the gate from the previous flight. She was having none of it and told me I never listen to her. I said she should’ve been more clear about it and that I was desperate to use the bathroom.

"AITA - Wife got mad at me for getting the hair color that she wanted This is bit of a silly thing but wanted to ask since this is bothering me


So my wife wanted to bleach her hair ash grey and I wanted to get highlights so we went to a unisex salon. 

This was a pre planned thing so during the day I gave her both sides of possibilities (like maintaining it and damage to hair etc) if she bleached her hair vs getting just highlights on her hair. 

I asked her many times to think about it. And later in the salon she decided to go for the highlights. 

Now when the lady wanted to do highlights for my hair she kept saying that my hair was too short for her to grab onto and asked me if I would like to get my whole hair bleached instead of highlights, mind you my hair was short. 

My wife looked at me and told me to get the highlights or not get colored at all. I should’ve understood the hint but I agreed with the salon lady and asked her to bleach my head and get me the ash grey color 

She was all fine and happy when the lady was bleaching my hair and she was even smiling at me etc 

 
But her simile disappeared when the final color was done and my hair had dried. 

Now my wife is mad at me and won’t talk to me 

And I feel bad and wouldn’t have got my hair colored if this would be the outcome

Edit: 

I gave her both possibilities and told her that if she wants to do the bleached hair color do it. ",reddit_AmItheAsshole,post,4,2025-11-19 13:08:47,https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1p1f0n3/aita_wife_got_mad_at_me_for_getting_the_hair/,352,352,False,256-384
"WIBTA if I refuse to help my SIL WIBTA if I refuse to help my SIL

I (34f) live in a joint family with my 6 elder sister in laws. We all live in the same building but have separate living setup. I am the 7th DIL of my family. For most part I do not interact with any of them except my eldest SIL.

Throughout these years I've always helped her in many ways, like taking tuition for her kids for free, attending their PTMs, lending her money when they were going through difficult times and much more. 

All was good until 3 months back I was blessed with a beautiful baby girl. During my pregnancy she was the only 1 who helped me in small ways nothing much like making sure the maids cooked proper food and packing my lunch. I made sure I wasn't too dependent on anyone though but whatever help I got from her I truly appreciated it. 

Now, here is where it gets messy. My SIL's daughter (lets call her Ri) has come of age and everyone including me and my family (mother's side) have been looking for a suitable guy for her. I'm being helpful as always.

So, recently there was a death in our family and the funeral was held in our parking lot. My daughter had just gotten out of fever and I didn't want to take her in a public setting but it was also important for me to go down for atleast 10 15 mins. So, I asked Ri to babysit my daughter for a couple of mins while i pay a visit downstairs. 

Ri took her time getting ready while I was already down. My SIL asked me who is there with my daughter and I said I asked Ri to go up to my room. My SIL got angry and said I shouldn't have asked Ri instead I should have bought my daughter down with me. 5 mins later I see my SIL going up to my room. It's only been 10 mins at this point that I'm down. I follow her and heard her telling Ri to go down. Now Ri has been in my room for like only 1 min coz she came late. She goes down and I asked my SIL what was the problem and she said that I shouldn't ask her children to help.

"AITA for asking my manager not to hire my former friend? I (18F) am in my last year of high school. I go to a school for gifted students where, as long as we keep our grades up and complete all tests, no one really cares about attendance.



I barely go. I study better alone, and I pick up concepts quickly. Since I turned the legal working age in my country (15), I’ve been working nonstop. I love working, especially typical “teen” jobs like retail, waitressing, etc.



Right now, I have three jobs: waitress at a bar, barista at a bakery, and receptionist at a kids’ club.



A year ago, I helped my friend get a summer job where I was working at the time. She wanted something to do, and the store needed summer workers. But she’s always been lazy. She promised me she would work hard because my name was attached to her hiring.



She didn’t. She sat the entire time. It was a retail job, and she refused to move from the register even when customers asked for help, she’d just tell them to find someone else. We had multiple coupons we needed to memorize; she never bothered to learn them. Every time someone used one, she called for help from another employee. She made a ton of extra work for everyone. She got fired after two weeks. Meanwhile, I got a raise and was made “responsible” for the store whenever the manager wasn’t there.



Ever since then, she’s been weirdly obsessed with working wherever I do, like she wants to “prove” she’s better than me. So far, she got hired at two more places I worked: the bakery where I still work, and a receptionist job at a law firm. She was fired from both.



Last week, I found out she scheduled an interview at the bar where I work now. I immediately talked to my manager and explained what happened at every job she’s had. I told him that if he hired her, I would quit because I’m not willing to deal with that toxic dynamic again.



He didn’t hire her.",reddit_AmItheAsshole,post,550,2025-11-18 11:18:52,https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1p0g7jh/aita_for_asking_my_manager_not_to_hire_my_former/,574,487,True,512-1K

But me and my friends were getting great progress done on the presentation and even got close to getting ready to rehearse, but then on Monday, a week before we were due to present, I got the flu, which of course is awful enough just because I would have tons of missing work, but this could screw over the presentation.

"AITA for refusing to cover for my coworker during her “mental health breaks” even though I know she’s struggling? I (25F) work as a case coordinator at a community clinic. It’s a demanding job, and our small team is constantly stretched thin. One of my coworkers, Lena (29F), has been going through a rough time. She lost a parent earlier this year, and her workload has understandably been harder for her to manage.

At first, I volunteered to pick up some of her cases whenever she needed a breather. It wasn’t officially assigned to me I just didn’t want her to drown. But over the past few months, those breaks have changed from occasional moments to daily disappearances.

Some days she’ll step outside for a reset, and I won’t see her again for an hour. Other times she’ll ask me to update her case files because she can’t focus today, I get it. I really do. But I’ve become the default person picking up the pieces, and my own workload has gotten out of control.

Last week, I had three emergency cases come in back-to-back. At the same time, Lena messaged me asking if I could just handle two of her follow-ups because she needed a walk. I told her gently that I couldn’t I was already drowning. She responded with, Okay, but I thought you understood what I’m going through. I felt awful, but I didn’t take on her cases.

Later that day, my supervisor called me into her office. She’d gotten feedback that I was less supportive lately and asked if everything was alright between me and Lena. I told her I cared about Lena and wanted her to get whatever help she needed, but I couldn’t keep taking her work on top of mine.

My supervisor gave me a look that basically meant We all need to be team players. I didn’t argue, but I went home feeling like I’d betrayed someone who trusted me.

Yesterday Lena barely spoke to me. I tried to check in, but she brushed me off. One of our other coworkers quietly told me Lena had said I didn’t care about her mental health.

For my fiances 25 birthday, he abd his twin decided to plan a trip to a nearby city. They planned this trip with Tim, who they haven't seen in person in years. Myself and Paul's girlfriend were also included though we had no part in the planning. Tim also brought a girl he know that lives in the city we visited.

A couple weeks before the trip, my fiance ask me of I had spoken to Stacy about the trip. When I said no he told me she was also planning a solo trip to that city for the same weekend but had canceled it. He told me to ask her about it, my response was that since she hadn't brought it up and it was already canceled there was no point. Additionally, I pointed out that he, Paul, or Tim could talk to her if they wanted to. (Tim and Stacy are really close)
I'll also add she never asked what the birthday plans for my fiance were. And the last couple of times I spoke with her I never had a chance to talk about what was going on in my life, nor did she ask. A couple weeks before the trip I saw her for her birthday and she wanted to keep the focus in her day, which Im completely ok with. The next time I saw her like a week later, she was upset about a guy not working out. So we focused kn that. We do not have the type of friendship where we text or call consistently so I dodnt have another opportunity before the trip. 
Fast forward. We go on the trip and have fun. A few days later Stacy leaves their friends chat upset saying she doesn't want to hear about a trip she wasn't a part of. My fiance is asking me why I never asked her to join us. So now I'm really confused. I thought she would feel uncomfortable being woth a bunch of couples and her trip was canceled.

"AITA 40 F 38 M bedroom camrea installation I’m a 40-year-old woman and my husband is 38. He put a camera in our bedroom. I unplugged it and told him I’m not comfortable having a camera in our room because it makes me feel watched and like my privacy is being invaded.

He says that if I don’t want the camera in there, it must be because I’m “up to something sketchy.” He insists it’s fine because only he and I can access the footage. I’ve stated many times that I’m not comfortable with it. It makes me feel paranoid and constantly monitored. I feel that I deserve privacy in my own bedroom, at the very least.

There’s also a camera in our kitchen that points toward the bedroom door. Clearly, he has trust issues with me, but having a camera monitoring me at all times feels like too much—especially in the bedroom.

He is now upset that I’ve said I’m uncomfortable with it and that I keep unplugging it. He keeps repeating that if I don’t want the camera, it must mean I’m hiding something or being shady. That alone shows the camera is there because he wants to watch me due to his own insecurities and trust issues.

I also have concerns about whether he’s showing other people the footage while he’s at work, or that someone could hack into these cameras since they’re very cheap ones he bought from a thrift store. I don’t feel I should be watched in the privacy of my own bedroom.

Would you allow your husband to put a camera in your bedroom to watch and monitor you? Especially when he claims it’s “not for that reason,” but then turns around and says my discomfort means I’m hiding something? To me, that clearly shows his intent.

I know neither of us is perfect. I’ve messed up, and so has he. But I’d like to know who would or wouldn’t allow this, and why.

"AITA for calling my roommate a dickhead for hanging up stolen property in our house? Hey everyone. I'm really at a loss here because my roommate situation has gotten a little more tense than usual this weekend. I (21F) live with three other girls that go to my college (All 21F). We became very good friends in our sophomore year of college. We are now all seniors and are definitely more focused on our studies than hanging out.

I personally don't like going out to the bars because Im not one for drinking due to family history. I also don't join them because one of my roommates in particular (I'll call her Hannah) tends to get hammered and act crazy when we go out. I'm talking like she regularly gets sent home from parties/bars.

Her recent kick has been stealing from frat houses. My long term bf is in a fraternity and I'm close with all of the guys there, so I don't really condone this. She always steals something small, like a fridge magnet or a cup from the cabinet. Every time I tell her off and say how I don't think that's funny and she shouldn't disrespect them by stealing their items. On Thursday, she was telling me about how she really wanted to steal something from every frat at our school as a bucket list for senior year. I told her again how against that I was, about how its wrong to steal, how at this point I will be very angry if she does it again. She claims that its fine because ""they're just frat guys"" or ""I'm not taking anything important""

On Friday I left on a trip with my boyfriend & friends. Friday night, she sent a picture to our roommate group chat of a huge banner that she had taken off the wall of the frat house she went to that night. I said ""girl put that back"" and she said ""whyyyy I'm so excited about this one."" I honestly felt mocked at this point so I said ""you're being a dickhead"". My other roommate (call her Penny) chimed in, calling me very rude and saying its just a banner. I didn't say anything for the rest of the night, as I didn't want to be misconstrued over text.

I came home Monday to hear Penny and Hannah calling me all sorts of names.",reddit_AmItheAsshole,post,49,2025-11-18 21:35:16,https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1p0vplb/aita_for_calling_my_roommate_a_dickhead_for/,724,489,True,512-1K

He got more defensive and I probably should have dropped it but instead I also got defensive and said exactly how I felt.

"AITA For telling my sister that her son shouldn’t ignore our grandmother? 28Y M. Last weekend I was at my grandmothers place, and my sister's 4y old was there too. He was watching his Ipad the whole time and when my Grandmother asked him something he didn't respond or not even look up. It happened 4 times and the 5th time I gently told my sister that he should not do that and he should learn how to respect someone by listening and that being on the iPad constantly might not be the best for him. She immediately got upset and told me that I don't have kids, so i shouldn't tell her how to raise hers. I didn't mean to offend her, and I felt bad for my grandmother. AITA?

"AITA for saying no to hosting a charity art show? This happened a few months ago but I still think about it from time to time so I thought I’d post here. I (33f) met Diane (38f) a few years ago in my city. She is an activist and I run a small art space. Over the past couple years, Diane and I had basically done a mutual slow-fade. To be transparent, she had a child and I wasn’t really there for her because I was carrying some resentment about some past treatment, but I did message her congratulations (she never responded). Though the art space wasn’t doing too well, we won a grant to put on a show that had some significant social media promotion. One day in the middle of this, completely out of the blue, Diane messages me telling me all about a really good cause she is leading, and asking if we can do an art show to raise funds. 

I’ve had a rough couple years. My father died suddenly last year and this year I ended my six-year relationship. I posted on social media about my father’s death and Diane’s reaction was *crickets*. It honestly really annoyed me that she came out of the woodwork to ask for such a big favor after not even bothering to send one message about this life-changing and tragic event in my life. The art space is not doing too well either, and we’ll be closing early next year. The reason I pulled away from Diane is because she had a tendency to be really bitey and rude, and I simply did not want to invest in a friendship where I was walking on eggshells all the time.

Knowing this, and feeling really exhausted from doing art shows, I simply messaged her “Hi Diane, our schedule is full but good luck with that.” She responded along the lines of “Good luck with that?” and outlining the severity of the cause before blocking me. I messaged her on a different platform: “Hi, I saw you blocked me but just so we’re clear, here’s my last message. Look Diane, my Dad died last year and I didn’t even get a single message from you. You don’t know anything about my political practices because we don’t talk and you don’t know anything about my life.",reddit_AmItheAsshole,post,160,2025-11-18 12:18:05,https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1p0hte1/aita_for_saying_no_to_hosting_a_charity_art_show/,719,508,True,512-1K
"AITA for kicking my dad out of the house,asking him to get his thing and get out To start, I never been near my father my entire life. He never took his responsibility as a father but I tried to forgive him. 6month ago I got accepted at university but with no where to live nearby the school. I was living with my mother at 1h30min drive. I had the idea to ask my father who was living with my grandmother at 15min of my university . My grandmother was supposed to go to an other appartement and my father promised me to pay the rent when that happened. 2 week before my grandmother quit the apartment my father told that I need to get someone with me to pay the rent and he wasn’t coming. Knowing damn well I was in school with just a part job. He told me that everything finish by working out. He had no job and he was living in his camping car. At first he told me that he had a job and the money to pay. I trusted him. Now I had the choice to take the responsibility to pay the rent and keep the apartment otherwise we were losing it. But the rent was so cheap it’s was a big opportunity for me since everything is twice the price now. Since my grandmother was living there for 35years. So I stopped school to start working and pay the rent and free from my parents to start my adult life or I was going back to my mother but it was to far from my school and no money to travel.

I mentioned to my husband that I wanted to spend Thanksgiving with my sisters this year and he did not seem to have any issues.

I announced to my husband’s siblings the following via text:

**Hello Family.** **This year, I will be hosting Thanksgiving at my home with my sisters.**

**I look forward to celebrating Christmas and New Year’s with you.**

My SIL **Oh nice ! We all celebrate thanksgiving at your home + sisters** .

*But that’s not what my initial message read.* 

I replied with **I would rather not. I hardly see my sisters and would like some quality time with them. (I felt the need to clarify because she was acting like she didn’t understand)**

One of The Brothers says: **Oh so we’re not invited? Why are you dividing the family? (He meant his side of the family. Both sides only see each other at random birthdays)**

I replied with : **I would like to spend Thanksgiving with my sisters**  **There is no need to make this a problem.** 

**We will be spending Christmas and New Year’s together** .

Needless to say, They are all mad at me. They left the chat. I know that My husband understands where I am coming from but he is mad that they are mad and has to deal with this before the holidays.

"AITA for wanting to give my niece a photo album of her dead parents for Christmas? hey yall. I (24f) have been planning a special gift for my niece (16f) for this Christmas and her birthday (her birthday is a week after Christmas). I want to make her a photo album of all the possible pictures of her mom and dad that I can find. 
for context- her mom passed when she was really young, maybe 5 or so, and her dad (my brother) passed in 2021. i have sole custody of her , she lives with my full time and is my full responsibility.  
I've been going through old photo albums. I've found a lot of pics of my brother and his wife, probably many of which she has never seen. I wanted to take every one I could find and make a photo album for her to keep in her room and look through whenever she likes. I thought that this was especially a good idea since I noticed she only had one physical photo of them that she had been clinging onto for dear life lol. I recently found all these photos buried in the basement and want to give them to her. 
her sister (30something) who is totally uninvolved in her care, says it would be an insensitive gift to give her for Christmas. while I understand this in a way , i dont really know if there will ever be a ""better"" time. its hard and emotional no matter what time of year I give it to her, and I thought it would be really special but now im reconsidering. 
am I an asshole if I do it? do you think this is the wrong time to give it to her, or do you think she'll appreciate it? what is your opinion on this? help!
edit- I absolutely would NOT ever give it to her in front of family. it would 100% be a private affair between her and I. ",reddit_AmItheAsshole,post,144,2025-11-18 11:28:30,https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1p0ggzc/aita_for_wanting_to_give_my_niece_a_photo_album/,397,397,False,384-512

I found him on PayPal, sent him $550 and a note thanking him for his excellent work and his kindness. Thanks for ALL of the kind words here, and for some of you, thanks for the laughs and giggles. 

To put some minds at ease, I'm 1,000% positive he didn't bury anything under the chicken coop, as it is built on asphalt. LOL

——————————

I(F70) have backyard chickens. I planned to have a new, bigger coop built for them this year. My regular contractor ghosted me a couple times for an estimate, so I was whining to my lawn guy about that. My lawn guy said he knew a guy that would probably be willing to do it, and he probably \*\*wouldn’t\*\* ask for money. I said I would feel bad if someone did all that work and didn’t get paid for it. This is important for later.

Lawn guy gave my number to a guy, Jason, who texted me and arranged for him to come look at the site and discuss what I wanted. He was stoked about the job and asked if it would be okay if he came after work each day during the week. I told him I didn’t care when he did it, as long as it was done by the end of July. It occurred to e after he left that we’d never discussed his fee, other than him saying “I work cheap.”

I ordered the materials online from Home Depot, then Jason and I went there and picked it up with his truck. I paid for everything.

For the next couple weeks, he came by after work. He finished the job a week before the end of July. After he picked up all the building materials and loaded his truck, I asked him “How much do I owe you?” He said that he’d need to figure that out since he’d picked up a few things at Home Depot, and needed to calculate his costs, and that he’d let me know. That was on 7/24.

"AITA for giving only certain family members christmas gifts? My partner (24NB) and I (23F) are the only queer people in our conservative/christian families. I think it’s important to include that I was raised Jehovah’s witness, so my family didn’t celebrate holidays or birthdays period and now I’m very bad at gift-giving culture within holidays. Gift giving looked very different for us. 

We do Christmas at my partner’s parents’ every year. They are the oldest of 4, ranging in age from 17-24. 

For years after coming out, I was not allowed to be mentioned at my partner’s family functions or come to anything on their side. (I was previously very close to the whole family and their siblings). After getting engaged, their family came around a little and I can now attend a few family events throughout the year (which we really only attend to keep in touch with their siblings). This year, we have both formed a relationship with one of my partner’s little siblings who is deviating from the christian conservative path. We are doing homemade christmas gifts for everyone this year, and know exactly what to make her. However, we are not close to the other two younger siblings and know they are very conservative and christian as well. Is it wrong to only get one of the siblings a christmas gift?

He pleaded with me for awhile and started manipulating saying me how he  wont eat until i give him a hug. Wtff!?

T kept pestering his friend to hook us up but i still declined and declined till we sat together one day i explained how i couldnt reciprocate hes feeling because of my ex and stuff and he was still persistent.

I’ve met some of her family and stayed over a weekend before my transition so I thought it would be fun. I didn’t start feeling hesitant until recently when I asked her who all would be there and she mentioned I’d meet more of her extended family, specifically her grandparents. We’d always joked about how her family was low-key conservative, so I asked if that was the case for them as well. She got kind of quiet and said they were worse, and I joked, “oh so they’re gonna looovee me”, and she responded, “well they probably won’t realize you’re trans or anything so just don’t mention it.” I immediately felt hurt because she knows I’ve been struggling with how I present and on top of that, she wants me to hide who I am? I thought this would be an opportunity for me to not be in that situation but I should have considered this before getting her hopes up.

"AITA for asking my boss to reimburse me like he said he would? I (F, 24) am a recent graduate and have been struggling with the j\*b hunt. After many rough months of rejection, I felt like I needed to do productive work, so I accepted an internship with a small independent designer who was promising future eventual payment.

On the very first trial day I attended for this designer, he set me tasks to complete and i passed and he told me to keep coming weekly. I told him that while I would like to, i clearly communicated to him that travel costs would be a big issue for me and that it wouldnt be realistic for me to keep attending out of my own pocket. To which he responded and asked the amount, he would reimburse my travel for the rest of the month and for me to remind him at the end of the month. To which i felt reassured.

Come rolling to the end of the month, I asked him about my travel expenses and I politely remind him, with a message that these \[insert dates\] were the exact dates he said he would compensate me for my travel and i remember we had that agreement with each other since the first day.

But then he starts to gaslight me and starts saying that he only reimburses people who are ""part of the team"". (no one got reimbursed btw) And suddenly started telling me i was on a two week trial (also unpaid) to which i knew nothing about or was told about. He only told me about the trial day was the first day.

This then triggered me and didnt sit right with me with how he replied so i checked my working rights and found that he actually owes me. I let him know that I didnt appreciate the changing of his terms last minute and not telling me anything. I also had to tell him I didnt see myself aligned with him and working with him anymore. I then told him of my own working rights and what he owes me. And if there was no plan on reimbursing me at all, that I would have to contact legal authorities. 

Well, he blew up on me. The first thing he did was call me unprofessional and that im handling this all wrong. He belittled my work and said I did barely any work for him.

Sometimes her jokes are situational, for example, a typo can mean something completely different and she'll joke about that to no end, but oftentimes she'll joke about something about me, like how I probably have so many other girls that she doesn't know about (I don't), or that I have a secret family (I also don't), or that I'm a terrivle boyfriend (I hope I'm not), or even that I'm gay (I'm not), and I do play along, it's fun and funny, but sometimes it goes on for too long, and sometimes she involves other people (she once showed our friends an out of context screenshot of something I said that sounds bad) and when she does that, I feel uncomfortable, I even feel like deep inside she really feels thay way about me.

Whenever I show discomfort or if I bring this up, she gets sad and tells me she'll never joke about anything ever again, which makes me sad because I do enjoy her jokes, its just that sometimes it makes me uncomfortable.

"AITA for not finishing a coffee my mom bought for me as a surprise This feels trivial but I need a new way to respond to this. 

So I (28f) am staying with my family through the holidays. They live in a different state (11 horus away) & I work remotely so I can work from anywhere and am fortunate to be able to afford to do so. My mom (60f) is so excited I am here and while we have had our ups and downs she is very thoughtful and just enjoying having me around. 

She and my dad go out for coffee at their favorite cafe every morning and usually ask if I would like one as well. I have also offered to go pick up coffees as a way of thanking them for often buying me one. Some days I will say no as I do not always want/need caffeine and I have  grounds I like making at home too. 

Anyway...today she came back from a workout and surprised me with an  cold brew as she knows its my usual go to and I accepted and thanked her for the unexpected treat. Side note: I usually drink my coffee black or with barely a shot of milk but she added sugar to it so its much sweeter than I prefer. I don't mean this to come across as unappreciative but I hadn't really wanted a coffee today but it was so sweet I didn't want to hurt her feelings. To be honest it just isn't the end of the world and I drank about half of it anyway. A couple hours go by and she noticed that I hadn't finished it. In the past she may have said something like ""are you still drinking that?"" or something of the like... but instead she was like ""ugh can you at least go throw it out... this is why I don't get you things""

I was really taken back because while I can maybe understand her maybe being disappointed in having spent the money on something that I didn't fully consume, this isn't a ""habit"" of mine. Like I said before I typically get asked before hand and decline.

"AITA for driving myself to get pads? I (18F) recently went on a trip with my mom (50F). We drove her car down to an AirBNB where we stayed for a couple of weeks.

I have been on birth control since I was about 15 for irregular, painful, and heavy periods. Save for a few times that I've forgotten to take the pill, I haven't had my period in years. 

For some reason, my birth control just... decided to stop working while we were on this trip. I was taking it consistently and on time, but I ended up getting my period anyway.

Because I haven't had my period in years, I was unprepared both physically and materially. I had no pain relievers and most importantly, no pads or tampons. 

We weren't in walking distance of any stores, and frankly I wasn't comfortable walking alone in an unfamiliar neighborhood regardless.

I asked my mom if she could drive me to go get pads, and she said we would later. By the next day, I had bled through multiple pairs of underwear. I asked her again, and she said she would go when she had time.

I asked if I could just drive myself, and she told me no. I understand her reasoning: I'm a young driver, her car isn't one I'm super familiar with, and we're in a new area. I get it. But it essentially meant I just had to wait for her to get me what I needed.

I reminded her a few times over the next few days. Even after washing my underwear, it was stained and gross and essentially unwearable. Toilet paper didn't do much to help as a makeshift pad.

Eventually, I decided I just needed to do it myself. While she was out, I took her car to the nearest convenience store (maybe a ten minute drive?) and got what I needed. Before I left, I sent her a text saying I was going to grab the pads and that she didn't need to worry about it.

When I got back, she was waiting for me and pissed. She told me that she said I wasn't allowed to use her car. I told her that I had no other way to get to the store. She said that she would have gone and gotten what I needed, but I reminded her that I had been asking for days.",reddit_AmItheAsshole,post,4967,2025-11-17 10:40:02,https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ozjivt/aita_for_driving_myself_to_get_pads/,520,501,True,512-1K
"AITA for giving myself some time? AITA that I went to play tennis with my colleagues?
My girlfriend had sinus surgery. I'm working abroad but stayed an extra two weeks (three weeks total) to help her recover, dedicating all my time to her (no TV/PC). After coming back to work early on Sunday, I went to play tennis with colleagues on Monday for the first time. I couldn't reach her and hour before going out, but on my way she finally replied. Then after hearing where I'm going, started ignoring my messages and sent me a huge, angry text full of harsh words before I went to bed. I felt hurt that after three weeks of dedication, she was angry about a couple of hours of personal time, when I can't do anything to help her, as I'm abroad  I tried speaking to her but only same harsh words came, (you are my biggest mistake, forget this side, don't write me anymore etc.) AITA for ignoring her while she's recovering and I'm abroad, or is she overreacting to me playing tennis?

"AITA for telling my boyfriend he smells 
My boyfriend and I just recently closed the gap in a long distance relationship. I’m a 24F who loves smelling good because I grew up with a mother who never taught hygiene or did laundry correctly so I’m super sensitive. My boyfriend 31M, has to be told to wear deodorant (because he says we’re not supposed to wear it 24/7) but he ends up almost immediately smelling like Body Odor after a shower. When he gets home from work he stinks, and I started off calling it out playfully but now like he legit stinks. If I say anything about it he just gets so offended with me. I just want him to smell nice so I can nuzzle up next to him and not be engulfed by B.O. , but he acts like I am so mean for even bringing it to his attention. He’s currently mad at me right now because he got in bed next to me and I told him he stinks.  I love him more than anything I just wish he cared more about how he smells, I feel like I shouldn’t be close to gagging when he raises his arms in his sleep or to hug me. Am I the asshole ?? Is there a better way to go about it ?

"AITA telling SIL she is a bad sister This was a month ago and things have calmed down, and we still talk occasionally but it's awkward.

My brother and SIL went on a trip recently, and he got a specific souvenir snack for me. They knew it was for me, it was in a group chat. They came back and I found out SIL ate half of it, and gave the rest away. It's not expensive (like $3 ea), but it was the one thing I looked forward from my brother... My brother packed it for me, not realizing she had opened and cleared it while leaving the empty bag where it was. He almost gave me a bag of empty snack boxes.

I told SIL that I hate her selfish personality and her siblings probably feel the same way. Little did I know, her younger siblings did stop contacting her after a similar confrontation. She didn't take this too well and I was sorry about it assuring I wouldn't do that same. (Plz let me know if this breaches rule 8.1, this is for the purpose of context and not action taken by either sides for the comparison) They went to their room. I dropped off their groceries, cleaned up and left feeling part angry part confused.

While I didn't feel great about her sibling situation, it was frustrating to me. I don't want to confront her about it again since finding out its sensitive for her, but I also needed a place to vent. I'm just torn being angry at her and myself at the same time, and was hoping to find some closure here.",reddit_AmItheAsshole,post,262,2025-11-18 00:53:53,https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1p045di/aita_telling_sil_she_is_a_bad_sister/,329,329,False,256-384
"AITA for treating my kids differently due to their own decisions? Having disagreement with my wife. 

Kid 1 - 19m  saves money, and I’ve been teaching him about investing and he is very interested.

Kid 2 - 17m  saves no money (from doing the exact same work, during the same time period), spends it all on his friends and despite my guidance cares little about saving or investing.

Kid 3 - 14f  just started working this year, and has 7 times more money than Kid 2, which was a pleasant surprise to me the way she has taken responsibility, and has taken an interest in investing.

They have all held the exact same summer job, except Kid 1 is now old enough to legally work as an adult so he can work during the school year.

With Kid 1  I sold him a car for $5,000 which he paid for in cash (car was worth around $9k).  I tried giving him my old stick shift, but he didn’t like it and wanted a bigger car.  I let them make their decisions, so I sold him our other car.  Well, that car had a major break down within 6 months of him giving us $5k.  So in an effort to make things right, I bought it back from him, and we agreed to use it to put a down payment down on a Rav4.  I also cover ½ the payment, but he pays insurance and 50% of the loan payment.

With Kid 3  we are looking to set up a child’s investment account, and I’ve also borrowed money from her and I am paying it back in interest, her bank account doesn’t have access to CDs or lightweight investments so I set up the Bank of Daddy and pay her interest.

With Kid 2  I’ve attempted to correct bad spending behaviors that he has.  He has next to no money.  I mean, they’ve all gotten the same talks, the same education, the same offer of help.  But I don’t control what they actually do with their money.  So he hangs out with friends and likes to throw money around.",reddit_AmItheAsshole,post,2765,2025-11-17 11:50:15,https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ozle73/aita_for_treating_my_kids_differently_due_to/,843,464,True,512-1K
"AITA, for an oversight that went into a fixable accidental mess in her clothes? ""My(40+) wife(30+) placed clothes she was about to iron on our bed and then went to shower. I brought our six-year-old daughter into the room to put on lotion after I shower her. She got distracted, became playful, and accidentally got lotion on the clothes.

Now, my wife is upset with me, to the point where she is cancelling our trip, throws things and insults me saying it's my fault for not moving the clothes when I saw our daughter playing near them. She feels that since she was in the shower, I became responsible for watching the clothes.

She has a lot of issues with me because of miscommunication which she only brings up whenever she gets the chance and her expectations of me are high in my role as the Father in the house. Just bringing it up to understand where her anger is coming from. And some of here resentments are from the past which she can't move on from.

AITA and deserving of this kind of toxic and draining behavior?


Additional context:

I think I need to elaborate. My daughter is trained to apply her own lotion, which is why I allow her to do it by herself. She simply forgot to spread out some of it on her tiny arm. This unspread lotion then transferred to the clothes, a spot about the size of my thumb, which I immediately removed without a spot. I was just asking here because I think that over reacting like that is unnecessary for something that can be fixed, that's why I wasn't bothered too much because she wasn't really playing with the lotion.",reddit_AmItheAsshole,post,0,2025-11-19 15:05:31,https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1p1i8lb/aita_for_an_oversight_that_went_into_a_fixable/,355,355,False,256-384

I (F16) have been smoking (cigarettes) for approximately a year and a half. my parents also smoke and had been since I was a child (but they mostly tried to 'hide' it from me and my siblings when we were younger). when they found out that I smoke, they were angry at me, sure, but didn't exactly stop me. at first, I wasn't allowed to smoke in their near proximity, now they don't really care. when it got more serious, my mother gave me her ID so that I could buy cigs at a cigarette machine (no clue if that's the correct translation). now my father buys me them. sometimes, when I'm out of cigs, my parents roll me one (they use loose tobacoo and filters). my father hadn't bought me cigs for a few days now (which sucks for me because I have never been on a t-break or any break), and now they get annoyed when I ask for them to roll me one.

so, I'm kinda pissed. they've been enabling me, ngl. they could've stopped me when I wasn't addicted, they could've never bought me cigs in the first place.

"AITA for singing at my sister's wedding? I (F17) have an older sister (F23) who got married last weekend. The wedding had all of the extended family from her side and the groom's, and we both have big families so the wedding was pretty big.

During the reception, my aunt had requested a song from the DJ and went up to the microphone by the dance floor and started singing along to a Katy Perry song. I assumed she just spontaneously did this and that this wasn't preplanned.

I just assumed this was something any guests could do as a bit later my other sister did the same thing with a different song. Afterwards, I requested a song (Yellow by Coldplay if that makes a difference) and sang it. My sister (the bride) was giving me a weird look with her hands on her hips the whole time.

Towards the end of the reception when most of the guests were leaving, my sister called me embarrassing and asked why I got up and sang at her wedding. I said that I didn't understand the problem and pointed out that our aunt and other sister also sang. She explained they were preplanned ""as a surprise"" and songs that she wanted them to sing. She said that I ""sing really badly"" and she hadn't asked me to sing, and that I shouldve checked with her. I was really taken aback because no one mentioned to me they were planned to sing, how was I supposed to know?

"AITA for making a big deal about my sister taking my Keurig My (26F) sister (24F) just bought a house. She has previously been living with my parents. For context, I’ve been moved out for 6 years and now live about 3 hours from my parents and sister (they live in the same area).

When I was in high school, I asked for a Keurig for Christmas (my parents don’t drink coffee). My sister and I both used it throughout high school and then when I moved out, I left it at my parents. My sister continued to use it while she was living there, and I continued to use it when I visit my parents (I have a small stash of K cups that I store at their house so I can have a cup of coffee in the morning and continued to clean it throughout the years).

When I last went to visit my parents, I saw that the Keurig wasn’t there and I asked about it. My mom said my sister had taken it to her new house. I said it was my Keurig and that I like to have it there so I can have a cup of coffee in the morning during the one weekend a month I usually spend with my parents. I ended up going to Dunkin Donuts for coffee that weekend, but I mentioned to my sister that she took my Keurig (and implied that I wanted it back). She got snippy and said she wasn’t going to buy a new one when there was a perfectly good one that wasn’t being used. I told her she could consider that her housewarming gift from me then and she said I was being an asshole. 

I’m considering buying a new Keurig (that will almost definitely be nicer than the 10 year old one she took for her house) on Black Friday and leaving it at my parents with strict instructions that it stays there. My husband said doing that is super rude and that I should just give my sister the new Keurig as an actual housewarming gift and bring the old one back to my parents.

"WIBTA for telling people off for being obnoxious in the sauna? I go to a fairly large gym in my city - it's one of those chain gyms akin to Planet Fitness. It was an old grocery store repurposed into a gym.

  
After my workouts, I love going to the sauna for about 15-20 minutes. It feels good to get a good sweat and it's dark and relaxing. Recently, there have been some people at my gym who take it upon themselves to not have consideration for others in the sauna and either exercise or talk loudly on the phone.

  
The first situation has been an issue of mine for a while. There is an older gentleman, I would say 50s or 60s, who will exercise in the sauna by the jumping up and down in place. I don't mind if someone does some light stretching if the sauna is near empty, I sometimes do, but this man will jump up and down for minutes on end, wearing the squeakiest slides/rubber sandals that have ever existed. Even if I try to look away, I can still see him out of the corner of my eye, jumping away. When I turn my noise-canceling headphones all the way up, I can still hear his shoes squeaking. I have brought this up to gym staff only once about two months ago, and they said they weren't aware of the problem and would try to do something.

  
A few days ago, I go back into the sauna after my workout and it's fuller than I expected, so I stand in the corner since no spots on the benches are available. Nobody is talking, so it's pretty quiet. The first man I mentioned stands up and starts jumping up and down again. I am quietly frustrated, since I can hear him through my headphones until I notice the woman who is sitting next to me livestreaming on her TikTok and answering questions from her viewers. I know she wasn't on the phone since I was standing while she was sitting and was able to see her phone and her camera on her face. At this point I turn my headphones all the way up and am silently furious. Out of the 12 or so people in the sauna, they were the only two making noise. Not even the TV in the sauna has its volume turned on. I noticed one woman was staring down both of these people and looking around to see if others were bothered.",reddit_AmItheAsshole,post,19,2025-11-18 13:32:36,https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1p0juoe/wibta_for_telling_people_off_for_being_obnoxious/,559,508,True,512-1K
"AITA First Time Renting Out My Home I own a home & my 2 friends (let's call Andy & Violet) rent out the other rooms. I've used Airbnb when traveling renting my own room out but nothing over a month. I signed up for another rental site since I was moving abroad but continued using Airbnb.
Andy had a lower rent in exchange for helping care for the home & cleaning between airbnbs. This has been going on w/ no issue for years & I have a great record there

Someone (let's call Ian) reached out from the other site for a 50day rental, contract signed

Ian moved in & I texted to see if all was ok. Not until afternoon next day I received a bunch of texts, some incomprehensible, that the room was entirely dirty/unprepared. I was surprised as Andy always prepared the room well.  Andy did forget and apologized & even texted Ian apologizing saying he would clean the room. Ian was enraged & continued texting me things that didn't make any sense +  bed sheets & towels were missing & that the room was drug-ridden

The room is fully furnished with linens/ towels. So I calmly asked for pictures & apologized, stating the room will be cleaned today by Andy. Ian provided no pictures & sent more strange texts: 'angoran bit food of a rag' was one. I was so confused.

I apologized again& said the room would be cleaned soon, + of course the night or 2 if needed would be refunded.

It turned out Andy had all linens ready but left in the dryer.

Ian refused to let us help/clean or take the linens/towels. He proceeded to then clean the room himself + said I shouldn't text him anymore to avoid making him angrier. I apologized again & stated that I am autistic, just trying to make sure things are ok & that the situation did make me cry as I felt so bad. 
Ian then texts me 5 days later demanding a reduced rent for after the 50 days + calling me a scammer, etc. I told him that I was not interested in signing for a lower rent/ continuing but that he was welcome to exit the contract now &  Id refund everything (-) the 5 days he actually stayed there.
Ian then began to name call me, again call me a scam artist, that I'm playing victim, a millennial b*, etc.",reddit_AmItheAsshole,post,8,2025-11-18 18:38:18,https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1p0rsht/aita_first_time_renting_out_my_home/,690,504,True,512-1K
"AITA for debating whether I want a relationship with my SIL? My partner and I are expecting our first child together. We are very excited and so are our families. My partners family has been living abroad throughout our relationship and so it’s been difficult to build a bond but we’ve tried our best and it’s worked so far. 
Everyone has been very excited for us, sent their congratulations and want to be involved as much as possible. All except my partners sister. 

She’s not congratulated me on the pregnancy nor has she put any effort into getting to know me. Even though for a year we were living very close to each other and my partner and I tried to plan meet ups and events. She was always too busy. If she did plan events then they were for family only (as in just her brother) and I wasn’t invited. 

She moved away a few months back and in between her move she asked to stay with us, before she would fly out. My partner and I were happy to and I was hoping it would be a nice time for both siblings to spend time together and while extremely last minute, get to each other a bit more. Before and during her stay, she kept changing dates and how long she would be here, ranging from 10 days to a week. In the end she only stayed three days before leaving, on the same day that I had planned another important family event months in advance and couldn’t skip. My partner spend that evening with her. 

We didn’t think any of it and thought the stay, albeit short, had gone well. Until we announced the pregnancy and she hadn’t congratulated me. She then told my partner that because of my pregnancy she wanted to build a relationship with me, but that I would have to apologise to her for making her feel unwelcome during her stay by having alternative plans. I will not be giving an apology as I believe there’s no basis for it. She also said she didn’t think my partner and I would last long together and the only reason we were together is because of our sex life.",reddit_AmItheAsshole,post,19,2025-11-18 12:10:52,https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1p0hmh8/aita_for_debating_whether_i_want_a_relationship/,517,448,True,512-1K
"AITA I paid my roommate to leave our room for the weekend (This post isn’t about my relationship)
So I (19f) planned a weekend visit for my boyfriend in my dorm. I have a roommate, she lives a 4 hour drive from our uni, she had told me that she was going to visit her boyfriend at his uni and be gone for the weekend. The reason I planned my boyfriend visiting that weekend was because I knew she would be gone. 

For context: Im a very private person and I don’t like having my boyfriend over when my roommate is present, it’s really awkward for everyone involved. Also my roommate is in our room practically 24/7 on the weekends so I never have alone time. I also can’t drive until further notice but I’m working on it, so I have no way to visit him rn otherwise I would be visiting him.

Anyway, she flaked out last minute and decided she didn’t want to visit him. So she would stay the entire weekend 😬. I wasn’t having it and asked if she could go home this weekend, she said she couldn’t bc she didn’t have enough money for gas to go. Which, in hindsight, was probably her just trying to decline; however, Im a problem solver so I asked her how much she would need for gas for a round trip and paid it to her plus some extra for the trouble. I was a little pushy with asking but she could have said no and refused it without me getting mad at her. 
Sure it’s annoying that I get no alone time and would have to spend time with my boyfriend with her sitting literally 5ft away.. but I wouldn’t hold a grudge. 

She accepted the money and was gone for the weekend though. And she came back mad at me. So now we have a meeting with the RA. Was I the Asshole?

Edit: To clarify bc no one sees my comment abt this, I live in a small town in the middle of nowhere i have no way of getting to a hotel or Airbnb otherwise I 100% would have.

"AITA for lecturing my SIL? I (20F), offered to babysit my 1 year old niece at my older brother's home. Both her parents have full-time jobs and only have the weekends available for their child. My SIL, wanted to hire a babysitter so I decided to offer my services to them since it's my niece and I honestly can't imagine the stress on that kid not being around familiar faces plus the money my brother would need to pay for the sitter full-time as my SIL won't allow herself to pay for the sitter since it's my brother's ""responsibility"", ""since it is his child"" as she says. Mind you this is her and my brother's biological child. My brother and his wife earns a little more than 20,000 Philippine pesos a month. When she heard my offer, she was hesitant at first but knowing it would cut cost, she agreed. 

After a week of babysitting my lovely niece, my brother was very grateful and couldn't stand the thought of not repaying me. I refused since the whole purpose of me babysitting was for him to be able to use the money for other things, but he wanted to anyway. He says ""you might need it for your school expenses or maybe for travel expenses"". My SIL, upon hearing this got upset saying how they need it more than I do which was what I kept pointing out to my brother. She said ""your kid still needs diapers, you can go help them after your kid no longer has needs for YOU to fill"". Her saying those words makes it seem like it's my brother's responsibility alone and it's unfair. Yes, it's usually the father's role to provide but knowing they earn only that much, couldn't she have thought to split? My brother pays for everything in that household plus SIL's parents also live with them.

Hearing her say it's my brother's responsibility, I calmly asked her ""don't you guys share the expenses around this place? Considering his salary alone, you wouldn't survive"". She got upset and told me to mind my business and that I was a greedy and disgusting person for using my niece to ask for money from my brother knowing that he has a family to provide for.

I've only been seeing Mae for 11 months and two weeks, so I know that's not like super serious necessarily on her part, but I love her and really hope she's the one. Sappiness aside, her mother actually reached out to me and invited me to Thanksgiving. 

> This is Mrs. [LastName], [Mae's] mother. I hope your classes are going well! I just wanted to reach out to invite you to stay over Thanksgiving break. I haven't told Mae that I'm asking you yet, so don't feel any pressure at all if you'd rather go home.

Mae and I go to boarding school and I usually go to two summer camps, so I haven't really seen my parents in person much since last June. I don't really... like Thanksgiving at our house. I know that's stupid and ungrateful but by God it feels somewhere between a white tie wedding I wasn't invited to and a cattle auction. I could put all my relatives in a group chat and screenshot my grades and we'd get the same or better result.

Also, some of my parents'/relatives' friends keep lowkey trying to set their kids up with me. I really doubt most of them are actually interested, but I'm in a committed relationship so... i don't know, it's just even more uncomfortable than usual.

Anyway, excuses aside, I asked my parents if I could go to Mae's instead and they flipped. 

They're saying I'm ungrateful, that they've barely seen me these last years, and that I'm going to take away one of their last parenting experiences while I'm still a ""kid"". Which... I guess is kinda true (in highschool, at least). But I can always just be there next year? I highly doubt they're going to disown me, and there's no highschool-specific roles.

Another thing that doesn't help my concerns is that the thing I'm asking for is a bit pricey, and knowing how the economy is rn, I don't wanna put that kind of pressure on my parents to buy it for me(the thing I was wanting was a switch 2 with persona 3 reload cause I've been pretty excited about its release on switch but currently don't have the switch 2)

My parents, and espeically my mom are super nice when it comes to holiday gifts, so it's not like they would get mad if I asked for stuff, I just don't want to come off like I'm veruca salt up in here asking for a golden egg.

Im thinking of letting her know that I'm fine with waiting till christmas and that there's no pressure to buy something that expensive(kinda do that anyways when I ask for stuff 😅) but I wanted to see what others thought about this. Would I be the asshole for asking my parents for a switch 2 and persona 3 reload for my birthday/christmas?

TL;DR: I feel bad for considering asking my parents for a switch 2 and persona 3 reload for my birthday/Christmas because it's expensive and don't wanna stress them out.

"AITA for telling my friend off after she tried giving me advice? Me and my friend are both 18 and in the last year of high school. Where we’re from, this is a big deal, because high schools are already career focused and the final exams are important in colleges and job. I am terrible at memorizing things that do not interest me. Because of that, I am doing horribly in art history lately. 

As a part of the final exams, there is a spoken part. You draw a topic (in this case a specific time in art history such as Ancient Greece, Renaissance or Cubism) and speak about it for about 15 minutes. As an emotional and easily irritable person, this is my worst nightmare. It is absolutely nerve wrecking to do that while 19 other girls are sitting behind you, listening to your every word and the teacher, that clearly has strong dislike towards you (long story), likes to interrupt you if you’re silent for even a second. According to her, I will barely pass.

Now, I know what my biggest issue is. I’d say I am more than self aware on my own shortcomings regarding my studies. We are not here for that though.

Finally, we get to the issue at hand. My friend, after this only referred to as A, is good at art history. In fact, she is brilliant and I admire her for her dedication to her studies. But, god. She does not realize that we are not the same person. While mindlessly complaining about this, she likes to “give advice”. Her advice consists of: “you have to try harder” or “you should just think about it more” etc. I am losing my mind. She doesn’t seem to understand that we are not the same. I cannot even complain around her. She immediately tries to give me advice that is quite literally useless to me. And I don’t even need advice most of the time. I just want to complain.

While A is amazing at subjects that need extensive memorizing, she sucks at languages. Which is my forte. I noticed that she gets irritated whenever I try to give her advice on that, so I stopped and usually just listen to what she has to say and then nod and confirm that English is absolute bullshit.",reddit_AmItheAsshole,post,14,2025-11-18 11:28:48,https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1p0gh9u/aita_for_telling_my_friend_off_after_she_tried/,739,489,True,512-1K
"AITA for wanting my mother to just drive me to school on her way to work So quick rant, I (15m) slept through all four of my alarms and ended up waking up at 7:40  which is when my bus leaves, and I thought ""this isn't the worst, I can ask mom to drive me"" since school is far and it's too cold to walk. Instead, mom (~41f) said ""put a coat on and get walking"" so I did, reluctantly, but I didn't really have another option. Now something to note is that I live in a town with a canal down the middle of it, with three bridges, and I live on the opposite side from the school. The bridge that I can get to is one of those lift bridges. Anyway, AS I WAS GETTING THERE the bridge started going up, so annoyed, I waited... THEN A SECOND BOAT STARTED COMING! I was like ""f*ck this"" and texted my mom ""Hey, I'm stuck at the bridge, could you come pick me up?"" And she replied with ""serves you right, maybe you should wake up on time"" then another text shortly after ""if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go be on time for work"" like WTF MOM is it so hard to come pick up your son?! The school bell had already rang by the time the bridge was down, and I ended up very close to missing my OSSLT test, which I REQUIRE TO GRADUATE.

"AITA for asking my roommate not to have people over past midnight even though we technically haven’t really talked about quiet hours? I (23F) share an apartment with my roommate & friend “Jess” (24F). When we moved in, we didn’t make a detailed roommate contract, but we had a quick convo about being “respectful” and “communicating about issues”. Nothing super like formal.

For the first couple months, things were fine. But recently Jess has been having people over late. Like past midnight on weekends and sometimes even weekdays. She doesn’t host parties exactly, but she’ll have 3-4 friends over to talk, watch shows, cook, whatever. They’re not screaming or blasting music, but the walls are thin and I can hear everything… laughter, movement, cabinets, the TV. It wakes me up a lot. 

This has been happening 2-3 times a month, always on nights before my early classes or shifts. I tried to ignore it at first because I didn’t want to be controlling, and I know we never set official quiet hours. But after the third midnight hangout in one month, I finally snapped.

Last week she brought people over at 12:15AM on a Wednesday. I had a presentation the next morning and was already anxious. I opened my door and (not super nicely) asked if they could keep it down and maybe not have people over so late. Jess pulled me aside and said I was “overreacting” because they weren’t even being loud, and we never set any rules about guests or noise.

I told her that “common sense quiet hours” are kind of a universal roommate thing and that it’s disrespectful to assume I’m fine with late-night hangouts when she knows I wake up early. She said if I needed strict quiet hours, I should have brought them up when we moved in or talked about it earlier instead of snapping in the middle of nowhere.

Later she texted me saying she felt attacked and embarrassed in front of her friends. I felt bad because I reacted out of emotion, but also… I was exhausted and felt like she didn’t care.

Now things are super tense and the apartment is awkward, but our lease ends next year...",reddit_AmItheAsshole,post,5,2025-11-18 19:13:02,https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1p0slit/aita_for_asking_my_roommate_not_to_have_people/,553,500,True,512-1K
"AITA for saying my mom only cares about her reputation and not her kids at a friends dinner. Context: I'm 18 atm and when I was 16 i ran away from home for about 1 week after a big argument with my mother, who i have a very turbulent relationship with. I ended up coming back after a call with my middle brother.

Today we went to a dinner with some family friends and one of them was congratulating me on getting into the university i wanted. I'm the first person of our family to go to university (including cousins, aunts etc..) so this is a big deal for me cause im very proud of it. Then another person joined in and said I was a very good child and would love to have a child like me. My mother decided to join in and said I wasn't a good child, I was selfish and self centered and I gave too much trouble and decided to tell them about the time i ran away from home (which she always brings up everytime someone compliments me).  
The room got very awkward and people stopped talking and just stared at me. I exploded because this was years of situations like this happening. I got up and very loudly said that my mother was the selfish and self centered one, that she only cared about her reputation and being viewed as a saint for having to deal with a ""troublemaker"" like me. I told her that she should be thinking of the reason of why i did what I did and not telling the world to make herself appear innocent, and that my two older brothers think the same. Then i left and went home. I do believe i shouldn't have done it in front of everyone there, but my temper was holding by a thread. We live together and she hasnt uttered a word to me, and left me a note saying i should start paying rent because if i think she's such a bad mother then she 'finally' will be one. My brothers told me i was right on arguing with her but i shoul've done it when i got home.",reddit_AmItheAsshole,post,1162,2025-11-17 10:33:12,https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ozjclo/aita_for_saying_my_mom_only_cares_about_her/,424,424,False,384-512

I told them many times to just turn it down a bit, then a few seconds later they turn the volume back up because to them, the music doesn't sound nice if not on full volume. I am so tired of their freaking music and the noise in general, so I threatened them with going to the principal if it keeps happening, they stopped playing for now, but they keep complaining and talking shit behind my back.

"AITA for walking out of the restaurant and leaving my friend My girlfriends and I went a restaurant two days ago (I was the designated driver). I ordered my meal and they ordered their meal. I went to take a picture of my plate and before I could even take the picture, one of them used her fork and stirred up my food. I got upset and asked her why she would do that and she told me it was “cringe” to take pictures of food. I could tell the other girls were uncomfortable but no one stood up for me. All I wanted was a damn pic because my plate was presented beautifully. I got upset and just walked out the restaurant and drove home, leaving them behind. When I got home, I asked who paid for my meal and Zelled her the cost. They started texting me and telling me that it was just a joke, what I did was immature and that it was wrong of me to leave them behind considering I was the driver. I do feel like I overreacted but I also feel like what she did was mean. AITA?

Edit: 
- I did tell my friends I was going to leave, “I don’t wanna be here anymore” then left. 

- My meal was steak, gravy, mash, and caviar, and it had a hibiscus plant on it since people are assuming it was pasta. Not sure if that’s important information or not. 

- The girls who didn’t stand up for me, laughed at the situation awkwardly. I could tell they were uncomfortable but they didn’t say a word. 

- The person who paid for my meal was one of the girls who laughed, not the person who stirred up my plate. 

- I was only trying to take a picture of my plate, I wasn’t holding anyone back from eating their food.",reddit_AmItheAsshole,post,8121,2025-11-16 23:48:56,https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1oz7d1g/aita_for_walking_out_of_the_restaurant_and/,401,401,False,384-512
"AITAH for my classmate messing up her exam because of something I said? So I (20 male) and she (20 female)  are both in a nursing school  and giving our semester final exam.  We sit on a same bench .Today we had physiology exam . Where we must answer some short questions (15marks) and the two Essay questions (20 marks ). The pass marks is 60 percent .  
So the major pass marks is depending on the essay questions.  Before writing she told me she can answer only one essay question.  There’s a math like    essay question where we have to show how oxygen is transported from environment to cell showing the pressure differences in different sites. In the calculation the values should be divided by 40. Before the end of exam, She asked me to clarify the accuracy of the process. I quickly said “the numbers should be divided by 40” because I was trying not to get caught by the invigilator.  After the exam she checked the answer and realized she misunderstood me . she thought I meant all the values should be 40. She became devastated and was accusing me of confusing her. She even created a scene in the elevator, saying I’m the reason she will fail. People around us were shocked and uncomfortable. When I was returning home, I was feeling very bad for her. Called her to explain but she was crying and told me not to contact her. So there’s a guilt in me that I should have explained properly.

"WIBTA if I told someone about a mistake in their tattoo? I just saw someone I know post a photo of their tattoo on social media. It is a nice tattoo, but has an obvious mistake, that shows that they only tattooed it for aesthetics and don't actually know much about it.

Think along the lines of misspelling a word in another language that you don't speak, or getting a tattoo of a chemical compound but getting the elements wrong. It is obvious to someone who knows the theory behind it, but to others it just looks nice.

On one hand I feel like there is no good thing that can come from telling them. They are excited about the tattoo and would be upset if they knew it was wrong. It is also not easily fixable unless covered up. On the other hand, I think I'd want to know. And also, there is just that part of me that really has to tell them about it \^\^ not to be mean, it just bugs me to see it and I really have to refrain myself from telling them. Maybe I'll wait until the new-tattoo-honeymoon-phase is over?

WIBTA if I told them about it?

  
Edit 1: 

They are a friend. I phrased it weirdly when I edited the text because of the ""if you do not know the person you are in conflict with in real life"" rule but made it more confusing, sorry

  
Edit 2:

You are correct, thank you :) I was too caught up in how much it bugs me, but I need to get over myself. And yes, I know that too much little stuff bugs me.

"AITA for not invinting my bff to a concert I'm going to with a common friend? Cassandra (25 f) and me (26 f) know eachother for about a year and a half. Emily (25 f) met Cassandra at my birthday and became friends.

A few weeks ago Cassandra  got tickets for a local band, that are giving lots of concerts.
This morning. Emily sent to the group chat that the three of us have another concert from the same band and asked if we wanted to go. I didn't check my phone for about half an.hour. Cassandra responded that we were going to see them but not that date.
Emily said she felt offended for not being invited.
Some context: Emily and I had been best friends since we were 6. We felt like chosen family. Earlier this year Cassandra, Emily and I met a new group of people, to which my friends became close to. I didn't feel as close to them, partly because I was focused on taking exams and didn't have much free time but I still attended some gatherings.

Emily eventually made a group chat with all of them and left me out. I felt hurt by this and expressed it to Emily. I tried to have conversations about this and asked if I made her feel uncomfortable, and told her that if she didn't want me there I wanted to know. She never tried to include me. I stopped showing up. Then she admitted she wanted that group to be hers. This Is  reasonable, relationships change and there's nothing wrong with needing space, but it still hurts. I got angry because she didn't communicate it sooner.
The main problem with this group was that there was a girl (30 f)  Emily liked, but said she liked me AND that made her jealous. I told her I really didn't feel pursued by her. I didn't follow her on any social media and the few times we talked I talked about Emily. She accused me of gaslighting her for saying I didn't feel this girl liked me.
We got some distance. It was heartbreaking. After some time apart we had coffee and later that month she came home for dinner. We had plans to grab coffee again this wednesday.

Fast forward to this morning, this happened and I texted her via private message saying that it wasn't that big of a deal, that she shouldn't feel offended (this is where I might be an asshole).",reddit_AmItheAsshole,post,13,2025-11-18 09:17:43,https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1p0d3qe/aita_for_not_invinting_my_bff_to_a_concert_im/,699,504,True,512-1K
"AITA for refusing to help my cousin financially for his house? My grandparents had a big house. A few years before they died, they donated it to their 3 children. The donation was purposefully unbalanced to the benefit of Marie, who lived all her life in that house and had been taking care of her parents for years. My father, Thomas, accepted the principle of an unbalanced donation, but he refused to renounce his reserved portion of his parents' inheritance (in French law). He warned profusely that their part of the family basically couldn't afford the house over the long term: it's big and quite poorly maintained. In practice, it meant that Marie paid my father approximately 100K for a house that was worth 700 or 800K. The third brother, Alain, didn't ask payment from his sister, even though the payment was due by law. From that moment on, my father became some kind of monster in his siblings' eyes, even more so because he was the richest of all three siblings. He had his faults: he got further away from his aging parents. Though it was difficult to go to that house and get dissed constantly by Marie, Alain, Marie's son Arnold and both my grandparents. His siblings then held him responsible for his parents' decline and death (though they were over 90). 
One year ago, my father was diagnosed with lung cancer. He never had a chance. He lived for 6 months. He told his siblings what he had. Before they came to see him, it took a phone call from me to tell them he had weeks left at best, which proved true. They all came once or twice. They came to the funeral. My uncle left early: he had a long drive, so he said. 
Now, 6 months later, I'm getting an email from my uncle Alain. He asks if I can loan money to my cousin Arnold, who needs to fix the roof of the house and cannot afford it. My cousin is a GP and will earn a good living from now on, but he has nothing in the bank. His mother Marie still owns the house, but she absolutely cannot afford the cost and the upkeep. 
I'm kind of shocked by this demand. Am I supposed to contribute financially to the upkeep of a house that led to this situation in which his siblings basically let my father die without checking on him?

I’ll make my schedule clear to all involved parties and hope for the best. I’m an emotional mess right now and that’s not her problem.

I (31F) am getting married next fall. My MoH (Kelly 31F) is my best friend from college. I asked her officially to be my MoH about 4 months ago, but unofficially talked with her about it a year ago. She was super excited and said of course. I was also her MoH about 5 years ago. My fiancee and I are each only having one person stand up with us, not a big wedding party. We're also handling most of the extraneous planning, no expectations for the MoH for a huge wedding shower or bachelorette party.

About 3 years ago Kelly and her husband moved to another state about 10 hours away. Since moving they haven't visited much, aside from family Christmas celebrations. This doesn't bother us much, life happens, we're still each other's best friends.

She reached out to me a few days ago and told me one of her husband's good friends (Kyle) is having his wedding on Friday, the night before my wedding, in the same city. I reminded her that my rehearsal dinner is that evening and she said of course she'd be there but would probably go to Kyle's reception later in the evening.

Kelly, her husband, and Kyle have all known each other since college as well, and many of their other college friends would be at Kyle's wedding as well. I know Kelly wants to see all of her old friends and celebrate that night, but that group of friends is also very liable to go hard drinking.

Would I be the asshole for **asking** her not to attend Kyle's wedding and **expressing my concerns**? She's in town for me (originally). I need her to be my support that weekend. She can see them earlier in the week.

"AITA for removing my cousin's fiancée from the cousin's group chat? For context, my cousin made a group chat with most of the cousins (ages 14 to 25) about two years ago, and that's our way of connecting while we're all in school, work, or living in different countries. He got engaged to his fiancée 9 months ago (his ex-girlfriend's older sister, but that's a story for another day), and some of us decided that if he ever added her to the group chat, we would leave. Their whole relationship seemed weird to us, and we didn't want to be involved with that. All in all, we've welcomed her into the family and treated her with respect, because at the end of the day, our cousin is marrying her. Fast forward to now, we were planning a Secret Santa, and he wanted to include her. At first, some of us wanted to keep it cousins only, but we let it go. Then he added her to the cousin's group chat, something many of us were against. Maybe it's weird to be against that, but this group chat is so exclusive that we haven't added any of our other cousins. One of my cousins made a separate group chat without her and named it ""Cousins,"" while I removed his fiancée from the group chat and said, ""Sorry, cousins only."" He then proceeded to remove himself and text me whether it was necessary to remove her. I told him that I only did what everyone else was thinking. Was I in the wrong?

Edit: there are no other partners/SOs in the group chat. He’s the only one engaged so far. The Secret Santa group chat and cousins-only group chat are two separate group chats.

"AITA for worrying about my mom? I (22f) am in graduate school in a different state than where I grew up.  This semester my brother (19m) started at this school as a freshman.  We live together off campus.  

Our dad died when he was 8 and I was 11.  Our mom (now 51f) was the best mom you could want - always there for us, supportive, making us feel like things would be ok after our dad passed.  

However, since my brother moved out in August she has been acting out of character in disturbing ways.  She has always been a home body but she has spent thousands of dollars going to random places alone.  She is wearing stuff that honestly even I wouldn’t wear at my age.  It’s really concerning but I haven’t said anything because I thought maybe it was just something temporary.  

But the thing that has me really concerned is my brother FOUND HER ON HINGE!  She never expressed any interest in dating and when I told her no stepdads she laughed and said we didn’t need to worry about that.  It makes no sense that she’d suddenly start acting like this now at her age.  

My brother thinks this is funny, but I told him it’s not at all and could be a sign of dementia or something since her behavior is so weird and unlike her.  I said we should do something and he said that it’s not our business if “mom wants to get her p*ss wet.”  I called him disgusting for saying that and he said I’m an asshole.

"AITA for showing passive anger at my girlfriend after she ate my chocolate? We live together. Recently, I went to Belgium (for the first time, very far away) for work purpose, sponsored by my firm. I didn't have much time to spend, it was a tight schedule but I managed to squeeze out half day to explore the place.

I tried some mini chocolates there are instantly loved this one - bought 2 big bars of it, one for her and the other one for mine. We both love chocolates. Also bought some milky ones, those were mainly for her as I'm not a big fan of milky ones.

I'm health conscious and planned to eat my bar slowly, (like 2 square segments per day). But my wife has no such restrictions set. I forgot about the chocolate out of workload.

It's been 4 days, today I remembered about it in the office and was eager to eat 3-4 square segments the moment I come back home. But when I returned and checked the fridge, I saw that my bar has only 3 square segments left. (I had eaten just 2 before, one bar had like 20 squares).

So basically, she ate 15/20 segments of my bar. Wow, so thoughtful! She had already eaten her bar a couple days ago and knew that the other one is mine. I was honestly pissed, talked to her about it and she thought making a cute, lightly apologetic face would make things okay.

But I'm honestly disappointed, she did it once in the past too. I get she has a sweet tooth, but so do I. But I'm controlling myself, never thought of eating her part of food without asking. I didn't eat the last square and left it in the fridge, telling her to finish it herself.

"AITA for withholding part of my outgoing roommates damage deposit for lost rent? I, 35 F had been having issues with a roommate of mine (35F). She lived here for 9 months and was late multiple times on paying rent and bills. In October, I gave her 6 weeks notice to move out. The agreed upon date was December 1st. We agreed verbally and in writing. On October 30th, she let me know she'd be moving out on October 31st, 1 days notice. Thankfully, my new roommate was ready to move in November 5th instead of December 1st. This resulted in me having to pay for 5 days rent. The outgoing roommate has been on disability for the last 2 years due to chronic pain. I understand she's in a tough spot, but AITA for withholding 5 days worth of rent from her? According to local law, I'm entitled to keep any losses that occured due to early departure, but I feel kind of bad because of her financial situation.

"AITA for not telling my former stylist that I switched to another stylist in the same salon while she was gone for a year? Now she’s back. So I went to the hair salon the other day and both my former hairstylist (Jessie) and my current stylist was in there. For context: Last year, Jessie decided that she was going to move almost an hour away, and she was gonna open her own salon. While I loved how she styled my hair I was not traveling two hours for a hair style.  So I decided to go to somebody else in the same salon who was just as good as she was. 

So for the last year or so I’ve been going to Cary. Well fast-forward to this week.

When I walked in, Jessie is there grinning from ear to ear, super happy to see me. Then it hits me, she has no idea I’ve been going to Cary ever since she moved.

Cary immediately calls me over and you could literally see Jessie realize in real time that I wasn’t there for her. The tension in the salon during the two hours I was there was unreal. No one knew what to say.
When I was leaving, Jessie stopped me and told me I was wrong for going to Cary. I told her she moved almost an hour away, and I wasn’t obligated to follow her. I also let her know I didn’t owe her an explanation.

Later, she texted me saying I should have told her that I was going to Cary, and now that she’s back, I should come back to her since I “stayed for convenience.”

AITA for not telling Jessie that I started going to Cary instead while she was gone?

"AITA for trying to get my (31m) partner (28nb) to have more healthy hobbies? My partner spends a lot of time at home just kind of watching YouTube and feeling alone or unhappy. I try and cheer them up by taking them on dates or going on walks or suggesting we watch a movie, but it seems like a lot of the time they are too tired. That's totally understandable, we both work full time and struggle with sleep so I get it.

So I suggest that maybe they get into a hobby that's just for them and requires a bit more social contact. We play magic, so maybe they could find a pod, or they mention getting leaner a lot, so I said maybe they should go to a gym or join a yoga class or maybe some sort of like hike group. Then they get mad at me for saying that they don't do enough, or that the hobby they have is unhealthy.

I don't think it's crazy to say that watching YouTube all day every day is not a good constant in one's life. I know it's not my choice or my life, but I feel like being a good partner is hearing what your partner wants or needs and trying to either get that for them or gently push them to get it on their own (with support).

"WIBTA If I made my roommate pay rent? Hi there! I really just need some clarity on this situation. So any advice is really helpful. 

So to set the stage, Me (Marie, 22F), my girlfriend (Aspen, 21F), and our roommate (Mia, 20F) have lived in a 2 bed 2 bathroom apartment in our college town since April. It’s in a decent neighborhood and rent is about $1,400 a month plus utilities. We split rent 3 ways, but because I make a little bit more money I pay a little more. So the split usually ends of being 500/450/450 and utilities equally. 

The conflict is that Mia feels that she shouldn’t pay rent when she isn’t here during school breaks. So over the summer (June-August) she didn’t pay rent or utilities, but her stuff was still here. Aspen and I didn’t want to make it a fight, so we just payed the rent and left it alone. 

However, now that Christmas break is coming up, she texted our group chat and said she doesn’t think she should pay rent for December because she is going home on the 13th and won’t be back till January 15th. I don’t think that it’s fair though because again, her stuff is here, it’s still her apartment. 

I understand that it might be difficult for her because she won’t be working over the break, but that’s not my fault. Aspen and I also have money issues (vet bills, car maintenance, etc) and I don’t think she should be able to just pick and choose when she pays. 

So Reddit, WIBTA if I made her pay rent?",reddit_AmItheAsshole,post,180,2025-11-17 14:39:34,https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ozq1gz/wibta_if_i_made_my_roommate_pay_rent/,389,389,False,384-512
"AITA for not helping my dad? I recently learned that my dad has a lymphoma. Surgery is not recommended since its right in the middle of his spinal column, so paralysis is highly possible. He's doing chemo sessions, I guess (not sure, we do not communicate after I blocked him couple years ago), info is from my sister.

My parents have been separated since I was a little over 5 years. My dad was supporting us until probably when my sister graduated from college. Our life was hard, my mom was having a really hard time making ends meet and was rarely around due to taking odd jobs anywhere (she didn't have great spending habits, too.).

We initially lived with aunts until moving on our own very little house. I grew up being jealous with my cousins and siblings and felt like I wasn't being liked by many(had attitude problems growing up, didn't want people feeling sorry for me, had nothing but my pride through the roof).

Anyhow, my dad and I started to have some sort of relationship again when I visited him some couple years ago. Cut it off after being so tired sending financial help every couple months when I was struggling myself. He's still in contact with my sister(whom he sent to college), and this is how I knew of his situation.

I hated my family, but started accepting our situation when things got easier for me. But recently, I'm starting to really hate them all again. My brothers are drug-addicts (one is incarcerated and the other's living with my mom, jobless). My mom supports them both, I guess. I renovated our little family home expanding it, exhausting all of my savings a couple years ago, which my sister lives in with her kids now. I lived there for some time but moved out because I had a hard time helping with her kids and around the house and doing my job (was high-pressure, especially when I started). I single-handedly rebuilt the home, added furniture and other stuff to make life a bit comfortable there. I've been continuously paying for their electricity bill since moving out to help my sister and her family(2 kids in private school, partner's abroad.) Her partner came home 1-2 months ago and she borrowed some money from me to help with expenses while her partner's here, or that's what she told me.",reddit_AmItheAsshole,post,5,2025-11-18 09:44:57,https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1p0drha/aita_for_not_helping_my_dad/,673,488,True,512-1K
"AITA for setting a limit on how often my mom’s boyfriend can sleep over? My brother (26M), our mom (51F) and I (28M) bought a house together in January. Just to preface, we’re all on the deed so we all have a right to enjoy/use the property. 

Things were ok until my mom and I had a falling out, we are no longer on speaking terms. My mom is the type of person who can’t have any downtime between relationships and has zero personality outside of them. She started dating a new guy a month after she broke it off with her fiancée. He seemed nice at first, and she only had him over a couple nights a week. Since then, he’s slowly been spending more and more time here, now consistently sleeping over 6 days a week. Our home is very small: it’s technically a 2 bedroom with an “office” that’s big enough to be a 3rd bedroom for someone who doesn’t spend a lot of time there. My mom likes to hang out in the living room so it wasn’t a big deal to her. 

My mom and I got into an argument about bills last week, and her boyfriend finally decided to get involved. He had a lot to say about me and my lifestyle choices, so I no longer feel comfortable having him in my home. I sent a text to my mom stating that overnight guests are allowed a maximum of 3 nights per week, and reminded her that any one person has the right to force the sale of the home through partition. 

I feel like I’m not wrong here. Is it unreasonable to get upset about this? They hang out in the living room literally all night every night. They will fall asleep out there and not get up until 2 am. I work until 8 pm every night so I’m typically up later than them, and find it uncomfortable having to walk past them constantly and basically pretend they don’t exist as we’re not on speaking terms. And honestly, it’s MY fucking house. I shouldn’t have to put up with some stranger that’s known me for 6 months thinking he has some sort of say on how I live my life.",reddit_AmItheAsshole,post,111,2025-11-17 15:34:54,https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ozrjhn/aita_for_setting_a_limit_on_how_often_my_moms/,779,485,True,512-1K
"AITA for getting my money back? I f(35) and my sister(32) have had a recent argument about my mom. For context, i have been saving up since January this year because i have been wanting to get my own home (i rent and live alone) next year before my birthday on february as a gift for myself. 2 weeks ago my sister messaged me asking to borrow cash for some emergency at home and that she will return it in two weeks time. I told her i dont have spare cash with me and i live paycheck to paycheck to support myself. She knows im saving up for a house and told me she will pay it back as soon as possible so me being a people pleaser, i said okay.

After a week i found out that its my Mom who needed the money not my sister and she outright lied to me to help my mom. Me and my mom are not on good terms, she disowned me long before this issue, because i was tired paying for her debts. It feels like never ending so i decided to stop paying. I told my sister i need my money back, and she told me our mom is going through a lot of debts, that i should have some compassion, and that i should consider the money they borrowed, ""help"" for my mom and never expect a payment.

"AITA for refusing to come to Christmas until my mother and I get therapy? I(29f) and my husband (30m) have been at odds with my parents for almost 3 years. My parents are members of the LDS church and I left about 9 years ago. A few summers ago, my husband and I went on vacation with my family and our infant daughter. On this vacation, my husband and I participated in a few drinks during the trip and my family became increasingly rude to him. Making snide remarks, sarcastic reactions to his questions, and just putting him down in passive aggressive ways. We were gearing up to leave the lake and my step father made a rude comment to my husband. He asked me to toss him a beer and my mother tried to stop me and told me no. My husband got upset for being controlled as a grown man. My mother also compared him to my abusive and alcoholic father which was completed unwarranted because he is the furthest thing from that person. We ended up getting into a huge fight and leaving early. When leaving, my husband tried to apologize and my step father scoffed at him and walked off. Since then I have only attended Christmas at their home so my daughter can see her cousins and I have not attended family functions out of support for my husband.  My husband unfriended my parents and brother from Facebook and have not spoken to them. 

Last year they wanted to do family pictures because all 6 siblings would be in the same place with their families. I told my mother no and that she can’t expect us to smile and say cheese for people who have expressed such hatred. My mother tried to manipulate me in front of my siblings and tried to tell me to show up with our daughter and they can photo shop my husband in later. I still refused and she broke down crying so I left. I didn’t attend and we are not in the family picture. 

I have tried multiple times to talk to my parents but they are insistent they have nothing to apologize for. They believe my husband changed me when in reality he just got me to stop lying to them to avoid lectures. I told them I won’t be coming to Christmas this year since last year was so awful. I told my mom I don’t feel comfortable attending family functions until we talk through our issues with a therapist.

"AITA for not believing my aunt is depressed? I'm very close to my aunt, but it's kind of tiring being around her. She's very sensitive and dramatic in general, so you have to be very careful around her. Last time, for example, at my graduation, I could only bring five people to watch, and she was upset with me for bringing a friend of mine instead of her husband, whom I've only known for a year. She also pressures me a lot to visit her, and I don't always have time because I work, study, and am also in a relationship, and she ignores me for a day or two when I say I can't go.

When she's not complaining about attention, she complains about her health and talks nonstop about how much she spent on exams that month. She had stage 1 cancer once, and since then, if you say you have something, she thinks she does too and will get tested. In the last six months, she claims to have been diagnosed with anxiety, PTSD, and even OCD. Lately, she claims to have depression and now wants me to go to her house almost every week, but I really can't. I would never tell her I don't believe her, but depression is a very serious thing, and honestly, she doesn't seem depressed around anyone.

Now she's mad at me because it's been a month since I went there, but I'm quite upset with her because of the graduation situation. Also, when we were there, as soon as I got off the stage, she said she was going home because she thought she was going to die and was very sick, everyone got a bit uncomfortable afterwards.

"AITA for refusing to call French lawyers for my American partner when I already studied the situation? My American partner is moving to France, where I'm from.

But as my partner is anxious about it, a friend of them ChatGPT'd a list of immigration lawyers they could try to get free information from, though they might not speak English.

"AITA for telling my SIL to walk her daughter to school? I (f23) am a university graduate and live at home with my mother. She owns the house with a mortgage that's been fully paid off. I pay her rent (around half of the market rate for our area) and do most of the housework. Me and my mother both work a lot, I work in healthcare and work irregular shift patterns and my mum is self-employed and occasionally has to travel for work.  
  
My brother (m31), his wife ""Rose"" (f31) and their daughter (f6) moved back into our mum's house on Friday. They got a mortgage on a home but it turned out to have a lot of maintenance issues, the biggest ones being with their toilet and shower not functioning. Also their heating doesn't work. It's estimated to take at least a month to fix everything so in the meantime they're staying here.  
  
Rose came to me and asked if I could take their daughter to school, as her school is a 5 minute drive from the hospital. Normally their neighbour (who has a child the same age) would take her to school but that's no longer an option. My brother works full-time and his shifts clash with doing this (he starts at 7am) and he and Rose share a car, as she only works one shift a week on Sundays.  
  
I told Rose that I can't commit to taking my niece to school everyday. She needs to be dropped off at school for 8am, and sometimes I'm doing overnight shifts that don't finish until 9-10am or I'm doing shifts that start really early in the morning.  
  
Rose got a bit upset and asked why I can't just explain to my boss that I need to be available for school drop-off. She didn't wait for an answer and said she knows it's not that simple but she needs me to help her. In my job, if you start requesting restricted availability, they will give you way less shifts.

"AITA for not inviting my mom with dementia to my graduation? I (22F) am about to graduate from college. A few months ago, my mom (58F) was hospitalized for a month with severe hallucinations and memory loss, not even recognizing me, and I thought she may not make it. Since then, she was diagnosed with Wernicke Korsakoff syndrome (an alcohol abuse related subset of dementia) and another unspecified form of dementia, along with bipolar and potentially schizophrenia. While I had previously booked her a hotel for my graduation (6 hours away from home where she is), I cancelled it under the impression she would not make a recovery. To my surprise, she has recovered well and is very mobile, but she still lacks social, logistical, and reasoning skills. Like most demented people, she is often confused and cannot follow simple instructions. Also, given the nature of her disease being alcohol related, I have suffered years of trauma from her addiction leading up to this point. She was abusive and unkind. She is extremely smart though, so no one but my sister and I feel this way, being the ones who lived with her through our school years. She financed my college which makes me feel worse. She is entirely set on coming to my graduation now. My family is guilt tripping me, saying that I am deeply unkind for not readily accepting the idea of her coming. In my mind, it is my weekend, my graduation, my emotional and physical trauma associated with her. She cannot grasp that she has done something wrong, nor does she even remember having a drinking problem. I feel horrible, but I know it will ruin my weekend and take away from all of the fun of being a college grad.

Edit: my aunt would be there too to help take care. She is the one who is guilting me to do this. However, she would have to take the weekend off from already full time care giving my also dementia grandmother. Lots of dementia. All around. Feels like more stress, but I understand that my mom can’t understand emotionally why I wouldn’t invite her. Also, the secondary nature of her disease is confabulation. She makes up memories and believes them and lowkey spreads rumors that aren’t true. None of it is with ill intent, but something worth mentioning.

"AITAH for not wanting to call my wife a pet name in front of other people This is going to sound pretty dumb because it is but i’m genuinely wondering if I’m in the wrong. My wife and I will call each other pet names (outside of the regular babe or baby) from time to time mostly as a joke. One of the names i’ll say sometimes is princess. Well tonight we were on the phone about to go to sleep and after I said goodnight she jokingly said “no you need to say goodnight my beautiful princess”. Its something she’s done before and we’ll have this fun push and pull until I say whatever it is. 

For context I live in a barracks and I recently got a new roomate after not having one for a long while. The room is small, we can each hear everything the other person says or does. 

When she said that, I continued joking around and refused to say it. We went back and forth for a bit until she gave up and said goodnight. I thought it was fine until she texted me a minute later saying “the fact you actually refused to say it is upsetting”. 

I replied that it just felt a bit embarrassing. Which she replied “embarrassing is crazy”. I retracted the statement and said it just felt like private talk to me and that I didn’t want to have with my roomate hearing it all. She just replied with “it’s fine, goodnight” in that dismissive way where I know she’s still upset.

The girl who made the list is hypocritical and controlling and  is always on me about throwing it out at very specific times but she is completely okay with the fact that the other girl who is her friend forgets to throw it out every week.

Both of them are bullies, insanely rude and unhygienic. Trash Leader has made rude comments in the group chat. Yesterday I went downstairs and saw that Trash Leader has not taken out the trash which has been piling up for the last 3 days in her week. I texted in the gc and said very neutrally that the trash still hasn’t been taken out and I would not be taking it out if the person who’s week it is does not.

Why should I??? You clearly see it’s full and your dishes are in the sink so I know you see it! I am not taking out trash you purposely left for me. I hear her tip toe down the stairs and wash her dishes and then she goes back up.

"AITA for not taking care of a dog anymore? My brother and I both have dogs. My dog wears a muzzle in public because he has a bite record (rescue) but is very well trained and I bring him everywhere with me. My brother's dog is very reactive (pulls at leash and barks at everything. this dog isn't even potty trained) but is friendly and small (my dog is big) so it seems to get a pass from my family. 

My mom and brother wanted to go to a few stores (marshall's and petco, both pet friendly) and my brother said he's bringing his dog. I said i'd bring mine too and they immediately said no because he's ""scary"" and ""embarrassing"" because he has to wear a muzzle. I argued that he's very well behaved and is never a problem when i bring him anywhere but they just don't care. 

This isn't the first time this has happened so of course i'm mad because my dog isn't doing anything wrong. I told them that i'm no longer watching my brothers dog while he's at college classes (I do online school) or taking it on walks (I walk my dog atleast once a day, the other dog doesn't get walked unless I bring it with me) or taking it with me when I go places by myself. So this basically means the dog will be in the crate a lot more, never go on walks, and only go in public 1-2 times a month when my brother has time.

Am I the asshole for this? I'm sick of my family treating my dog badly for no reason and then being fine with whatever the other dog does because it's a small dog. Also my brother won't watch my dog for me ever even though I watch his dog almost daily (one time I got home after being gone an hour and my dog was locked in my room)

edit: I also told my brother before he got the dog I wouldn't watch it for him because he doesn't have time for a dog, but he still got it. So really he's lucky I watch the dog at all, but the way he started treating my dog after getting his own is what makes me mad",reddit_AmItheAsshole,post,86,2025-11-17 12:18:49,https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ozm60y/aita_for_not_taking_care_of_a_dog_anymore/,469,469,False,384-512
"WIBTA For backing out of a roommate arrangement I am in a college town looking to move into an apartment with 2 friends of mine. One of who I currently live with, Matthew with and one that I have previously lived with, Tommy. A couple of weeks ago we all met up and searched for apartments online together and applied to tour a few that we liked.

Last week my two roommates toured one apartment that they liked without me (I had school and a job interview) and they've decided that they really like the place and want to move in. The problem is that one of the rooms is very unequal to the other two.

Bed 1: 180 sq ft, 2nd floor, walk in closet, 2 large windows

Bed 2: 100 sq ft, 2nd floor, Next to bathroom, normal size closet

Bed 3: 180 sq ft, Basement (there is emergency exit), Private sink (directly outside room vanity, no toilet), Small closet

Common Area: 750 sq ft

We had agreed previously to split the rent evenly, but when doing that It was for me under the assumption that the rooms would be practically identical or possibly one slightly larger/nicer that we would draw straws for.

The problem is, Since Mathew & Tommy toured the apartment they called dibs on the two good rooms, and expect me to take the bad room. Tommy's claim is that since he found the apartment he should have first dibs on the master, and Matthew says that since he toured it, and he currently has the smaller room that he gets dibs on the basement.

AITA for putting my foot down and asking to split the rent by sqft, drawing straws, or backing out all together? They don't want to budge.",reddit_AmItheAsshole,post,5,2025-11-18 02:45:51,https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1p05z8r/wibta_for_backing_out_of_a_roommate_arrangement/,375,375,False,256-384
"AITA for refusing to give a simple yes/no answer during a family discussion? So I was sitting with my cousin (R) and my aunt and my mom and my grandma and another cousin (M) My aunt was talking about some guy on social media who’s always negative about people But she mentioned one thing he said that she kinda agreed with

She asked us:
“Can a mom make her kids hate their dad after a divorce?”

Everyone said “yes” and stayed quiet
I also said “yes” but I said it depends

I told them something like:
“Yeah but it depends on the situation Like if my dad before the divorce was really awful to my mom and hurt her emotionally and basically made her life miserable then of course I’d hate him At the end of the day a mom is such a strong part of your life and I don’t want my mom hurt or sad
But if that same dad treated me totally differently like he was actually super good to me as his daughter then my feelings wouldn’t be simple I’d still hate him for everything he did to my mom but I’d also have this weird love because he treats me well So it becomes this mix of love and hate at the same time”

R said she could never love her dad if he hurt her mom even if he treated her nicely And she kept trying to convince me to think the same way

I told her:
“Everyone has their own life experiences and people see things differently We’re not sheep that all think the same I’m just talking from what I’ve lived through”

She got annoyed and said she only wanted a yes or no answer not explanations

I told her I can’t just say yes or no without saying why Some topics aren’t that simple

Then she said I was wrong and that if someone in life (even at work) asks a yes/no question I should answer yes or no and not go into details

I told her it depends on where you are who you’re talking to and what the situation is. A family conversation isn’t the same as a work conversation

So now I’m wondering…
Am I the asshole for not giving her the simple yes/no answer she wanted? 🧐",reddit_AmItheAsshole,post,52,2025-11-17 14:47:18,https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ozq8wa/aita_for_refusing_to_give_a_simple_yesno_answer/,502,502,False,384-512
"AITA for tapping the glass This one isn't really that long since much didn't go down but earlier today, I got on the bus. I got on and since the bus was relatively packed, I wasn't able to move to the back and stayed where in the front. After I got in, the driver closed the door and started to wait for the red light to turn green. During this brief wait I noticed some people trying to get on but the driver didn't open the door. I look at him and he had his head turned away to the other side, practically ignoring them. I motioned at one of the people trying to get on, asking if they wanted to get on and she replied with a nod. I turned back to the driver and tapped the glass to catch his attention. I told him ""Those people want to get on."" He almost instantly replied with a tap of his own on the glass (in retrospect I think he was mocking my knocks lmao) and asked ""Do you want to get off in exchange for one of them to get on?"" I raised my eyebrow at his reaction, not expecting my sentence to elicit that response. ""They can wait for the next bus this one's full."" He continued. I offered no response and the bus started moving after the light turned green. The next stop, he opened the door and let other people on. I found this incredibly stupid and I let out an audible sigh of ""you can not be serious"" followed by a small chuckle to myself.

"AITA for having a ""no ring, no bring"" wedding? Using a throwaway account for this.

I'm [32F] getting married to my fiancé [35M] next summer. We've been together since this January, which might seem sudden, but have been living together since Easter, and both know that this is the relationship we want to be in forever.

I am the last of my core friend group to get married, and have (playfully of course) been teased about being the 'last one standing' since the second-to-last friend got married last year. That, along with being the youngest sibling and youngest cousin, means that there is no one important in my life who isn't already married or engaged. When discussing wedding plans originally, and in line with our budget and venue size, we realised quite quickly that we wouldn't be able to have many, if any, plus +1s.

To me, a +1 is a friend-of-a-friend or unmarried/not engaged partner. From everything I knew about my fiancé's friends that I'd met, they were all married, and there is one couple engaged to be married next spring. He had often mentioned a friend [33M] who lived at the other end of the country, and his ""partner"" [29F]. I clarified they were not married or engaged, and so only included the friend on the invite.

What my fiancé failed to tell me in advance was that this couple have been together for 10 years, and will never get married due to some kind of trauma that the girlfriend has from her parents' marriage growing up. Given the no +1 rule, unfortunately I couldn't make an exception for this once I was made aware (I was contacted by the wife of my fiancé's best man to ask why this friend and girlfriend were the only couple to not be invited together, and despite explaining the above, she thinks I could have been more flexible). My fiancé is concerned that his friend won't attend the wedding (we are close to the RSVP deadline and we haven't yet had his response), but my own friends don't see an issue with ""no ring, no bring"" as a rule, given how expensive weddings can be, especially with guests I don't really know.",reddit_AmItheAsshole,post,0,2025-11-19 11:40:23,https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1p1clk7/aita_for_having_a_no_ring_no_bring_wedding/,513,480,True,512-1K
"AITA Christmas arrangements Hi Reddit

My partner and I are due to be staying at her mothers house for 5 nights this Christmas. My partners Mum, we will call her Mary, has 2 double beds and 1 single bed, to accomodate her and 3 other couples including us and no sofa beds or fold out beds.

This means that 3 people are without a dedicated bed sapce. In the previous year a couple of other people have slept on a camping mattress on the floor, and it has been suggested that it is our turn. I'm happy for the other guests to stay in the beds in the house and do not wish to take that from them, however, I am also not comfortable staying for 5 nights on the floor. In previous years, whilst i appreciate other people did do this, nobody was expected to do it for 5 nights.

My compromise suggestion was to get a hotel room for 5 nights, at my partner and I's own expense, about half a mile down the road, with the intention being we would only sleep there and would arrive each morning to be part of breakfast etc. with the family and leave only once everyone else had decided to end the day.

Unfortunately when my partner posed this to her mother, Mary got angry about it to the extent that she told us we should not bother attending at all if that is what we want to do. She did apologise for being a little over the top later on, but I am not sure on exactly what points she regrets saying. The point is though, she is very angry about this and has gone to the extent of trying to accuse me of keeping her daughter away from her family and called me abusive, and self-centered. 

My primary concern is that if we don't have a good night's sleep for 5 days running, not only due to the camping mattress on the floor but also the fact we are in a room just off the lounge which will probably mean we cannot get an early night if needed, we will feel terrible pretty quickly and it will not be an enjoyable experience. We also have a long drive back early following the last night and I don't want to be sleep deprived heading into a long journey home.

To add some context, Mary is very particular about sleeping arrangements and has actively avoided staying with my family before, instead sleeping in the car in our driveway. I have no issue with this as long as she is happy, but i feel it is relevant context.",reddit_AmItheAsshole,post,142,2025-11-17 08:35:37,https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ozgfvv/aita_christmas_arrangements/,679,507,True,512-1K
"AITA for kind of stealing the Inheritance of my brother cause he didn't paid me 20 years ago? I (36M) and my brother (38) losted our single mother 20y ago. At the time I was a minor (in my country) and he, an adult.

First some points to understand the then and the now. 
1. Until this day I only speak at him the absolute necessities of the legal and judicial process throughout our inheritance had to surpass.
2. He allegedly had stolen at least the bear minimum of ""10 months of salary"" when our mother was in bed. But he never had confirmed or denied or even told me what happened with that amount.
3. Two years after he alone had being using the inheritance that I couldn't cause the minor sh1t, we exchanged parts of the goods and its in that movement that lies the asking
Basically he offered me x% (percentage) of the good A in exchange of y$ (nominally at the time) of the good B. I accepted and we moved on: BUT, here the catch.

Through these 18+years I never had access to the ""good"" cause it was in a ton of sh1t of legal stuff issues. 

I literally had to graduate in law school, find a living point of money to then really start and finish the ""process"".

The AITA part lives in the fact then I had (and took) the opportunity to account 20 years of Interest over his fair share of the inheritance cause what I did ""sold"" never was paid in money and by logic over the debt the interest it is counted automatically.

Happens to be that his share it is (or will be sooner or later) almost gone cause those interests.

He don't know what will happen cause he signed a legal document (made by me) without reading (or he is just to blant stupid) agreeing with all the necessary legal stuff to account these interests. 
For disclosure: he never contributed to any legal stuff; he never paid anything; and to let him had access to a full competent lawyer I had to pay for it otherwise the judge would have to had to appoint a public defender (and there would go plus another who knows how much time)

By my accounting, these interests plus the costs that I paid over 20Y until now, he will not receive anything.",reddit_AmItheAsshole,post,0,2025-11-18 21:50:22,https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1p0w14m/aita_for_kind_of_stealing_the_inheritance_of_my/,548,502,True,512-1K

"AITA for expecting my GF (19F) to buy me (18M) cat allergy medicine if we move in together? I (18M) have experienced cat allergies for ~3 years.

I thought her mentioning the possibility of adopting a cat was more of a hypothetical idea. When she showed me the kitten originally I told her I’m allergic to cats, to which she replied she didn’t know. I very strongly believe I told her on a few occasions, but in her defense I probably didn’t mention it enough. Recently we have been talking about moving in together, to which I told her she would have to buy me antihistamines. She is a bit upset at the idea of purchasing a daily amount of antihistamines, especially since we agreed to split all other living costs 50/50. However, I am very firm on my belief that it’s her responsibility to finance the medication. Alternatively, I offered to experiment with allergy relieving cat food, and exposure therapy, but all of these would have to wait for a break period in school.

She booked these tickets one month ago, and even when she told me about it, I mentioned to her that there is a high chance I may not be able to go.

I tried to explain to her that I cannot control when I feel unwell and it would be similar to telling her to calm down from an asthma attack. She got even more upset with me and told me that I needed to be more positive and that I was ruining her night. I wanted to go, but I literally can't. I can't be sitting there around people throwing up and groaning in pain. That will not be enjoyable for me or any person around me. At the same time I still feel bad.

"AITA for trying to compromise in an argument I started? All fake names! I \[F26\] started an argument with Nina \[18?F\] in my college filmmaking class. We're in a group with Joey \[18M\] and working on our final project- a five to 15 minute short film. Following the previous project, I'm doing the script, Nina's doing the shot list, and Joey's doing the storyboard. For some context, the professor won't let us as the ""directors"" act in what we're writing, so we need to find friends/other classmates to be the actors. Nina hung up some flyers around campus asking for actors, and three people responded. I reached out to two other people, so five actors out of five characters have responded with interest. 

The argument started earlier today, when we started talking about when to film. We found that this Thursday at 2:00 PM would work, but so far only two actors said they were available, and Joey wouldn't be present. Something else the professor requires is that all of the directors must be present for any filming. I loosely have a problem with this, considering we're all college students with different schedules, and Thanksgiving is next week. Which might not seem like an issue, but there's a very limited amount of time after Thanksgiving and before finals, especially considering this assignment is due December 10th, and each of us have to do our own post-pro, including sound design, color grading, and editing. This problem is separate, and something we may or may not talk to the professor about. 

The argument in question that I started is when I sent an email through our school's email to my other groupmates and the actors, clearly asking for available times, since our biggest issue is when we're filming. I called myself the ""bad cop"" and said I would recast if someone's not available. Direct quote from the email I sent: ""Being interested in acting for this project is NOT the same as being available for this project"". I also said ""If you're not in this 100%, please don't waste our time"".

My social life is in shambles and i feel so isolated already in my own challenges that I physically am not at the point where i can’t help others without risking my mental and physical priorities. I have this classmate from Africa, a transfer student who expects me to give him recordings of lectures right after class asap posted on YouTube. So in class I have to use my phone to record for him and submit on CapCut and wait for that to load in 5-10 minutes then download and upload on YouTube for another 5-30+ minutes depending on how my phone wants to cooperate with me. Meaning I can’t exit YouTube during that period of time (aka my phone.) Whenever I record I can’t use my phone to take pictures of important notes or use for personal use. I have to lay it flat and not be able to use my own phone for my needs. At first it felt like he was just using me for the lectures then he bought me lunch one time and offered to help studying and took 1 hour of my time to vent to me. I hardly know the guy. I just know he’s a transfer student from Africa to the States and has his own personal issues going on. He did buy me lunch one time which I was grateful for and helped me study once which I admit was nice of him to do. This was after the 2 months of recording for him though. He expects me to record for him every day we have lecture. He has his own phone mind you.

"AITA for telling a girl that there are two sides to every story 
I (23f) met up for dinner with Sarah (23f) . Sarah had taken a year out from her studies and so it had been a year since she came back. We were in a friendship group so Sarah asked me how all of them were doing. After asking about everyone else, she asked me how Lara (24f) was doing. Lara and Sarah had an argument three years ago. They both describe it differently and to be fair  would rather be friends with both of them.

Sarah mentioned how she had asked Lara for help in the computer room with something as it was urgent and she felt that Lara had reacted very uncomfortably and asked me if Lara still had bad feelings towards her. Sarah explained that the past three years were tumultuous and she realised she had bigger concerns. I explained that Lara  still was not quite over what Sarah did. Sarah seemed quite annoyed and asked me what Lara claimed she did as she felt that she was the one who had been isolated and left out due to Lara. In summary, Lara had organised a games night and told Sarah the wrong time and location so Sarah thought she could not make it. Lara then made a separate groupchat without Sarah to organise the event. Sarah recounted this and asked her what she did wrong. 

I explained to her that they had both told me stuff that I would not tell each other and that Lara's recollection of events were different. I reiterated I did not want to get involved  Sarah got more annoyed. I always thought Sarah had thought I had chosen Lara's side as I moved in with her and had her at parties  She confirmed this she asked ""why then were you telling me to apologise to Lara instead of telling Lara to"". The energy got cold and she just changed the subject 

The subject came up again because Sarah was telling me that another friend had told her a girl who I knew to be a pathological liar had been telling people I hate Sarah and Sarah asked if I had heard this and laughed. I said maybe she meant that Lara hated you. Sarah asked if Lara hated her and if she still talked about the incident and  I told her Lara talked about the argument once during a deep chat with friends but doesn't tell everyone she meets.

I was a people pleaser so I want to be friends with everyone and make sure everyone got along in our class. My friend was a bit annoying and a pick me girl, due to which not everyone liked her. I was the the bridge of communication between her and the rest of the class which I did not mind as I liked doing that. We ended up going to the same university and my friend was really excited as we could always be together. During university she wanted to lie about certain aspects of her life which include: 

1. Where she studied in middle school (she was in a different school and city)

2. About her past relationships (how many she's had or who they were)

3.  Where she's from

So basically it was a lot. She told me this outright and asked me to not let it slip. I said yeah sure, I would try but can't promise anything since these are a lot to remember and i don't want to lie to anyone. 

Anyway, we both had a few mutual friends but we spent majority of our time in different friend groups (I knew some of her friends but I did not know how close they were or any specific details). Anyway fast forward to month 4 of being in university, I met a girl from their friend group on the train, she recognized that we go to the same university and we started talking. She asked me a couple of questions about myself and once I revealed that I went to my high school, she then quickly asked me if I knew 'my friend'. I did not want to lie and say no because we have stories together on Instagram so I said yes, I know her. I also had to tell her that we did not go to the same middle school as the girl asked me directly. And a few days later, something similar happened with another guy and he found out where my friend is really from (Basically I was hanging out with another high school friend when this guy asked me about it and I couldn't lie even if i wanted to as this another friend also knows the truth).

"WIBTA If I politely asked my fellow book club members to stop shit-talking Taylor Swift? As stated in the title, I'm part of a book club at my hometown's local library. The club is based around the book series ""33 ⅓"", a series of books that each focus on a specific album. We listen to the album, read the book, and meet every third Tuesday of every month to discuss the book, album, and artist. I started going a few months ago and today was my third time going. The group has met up a lot in the past and they're pretty close-knit, so I've been trying my best to fit in with them despite my social anxiety making it pretty difficult sometimes. Things have been going well, until tonight at least. The subject of tonight's meeting was the Sam Cooke album ""One Night Stand - Live At The Harlem Square Club"". We tend to go off topic a lot, especially lately because there have been fewer people than before, and somehow the topic of Taylor Swift came up. A few of them took the opportunity to take unnecessary shots at Taylor Swift, making fun of her newest album (one of them said it sounded AI generated), and generally just shit talking her. I love Taylor Swifts music, have since 2020. Her music has been a beacon of light in the darkest parts of my life. Because of this, her music has become more than music to me, it's become a part of who I am. It's in my blood, my DNA, my soul, my personality, it's everything to me. When the comments started happening, my face turned hot and I almost walked out with anger. I made a joke about walking out hoping that would stop the comments, but it didn't. I pulled my phone out to distract myself until the conversation shifted and I was able to rejoin it without blowing my top. Those comments ruined a rare night off work for me because I've still been pissed off about it ever since I left the library. The leader of the book club has all of us in an email list, and I'm considering emailing everyone and asking them to refrain from shit-talking Taylor Swift while I'm there. Up until now, I really enjoyed talking about albums I love and learning about albums I know nothing about, and I want to continue going to meetings, but I don't know how long I can keep going if they keep shit-talking an artist who's music so vital to my very existence.",reddit_AmItheAsshole,post,0,2025-11-19 00:56:10,https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1p0zms0/wibta_if_i_politely_asked_my_fellow_book_club/,580,508,True,512-1K
"AITA for not making my mom dinner. I (F18) live with my mother. I am currently in university and i have a part time job. Me and my mom have a very turbulent relationship, and after a big fight my mother made me start paying for my own food, and bills. The only thing i don't pay is rent.

My mom works two jobs, and to help her I do every chore, I clean the house, the clothes etc… any chore you can think of I do it. The only one i don’t do is cook since she made me buy my own food since last year.

Yesterday she got home and had no leftovers in the fridge and saw me eat my food. She exploded saying I was ungrateful and selfish and only thought about my own ass. That she works her ass off to pay rent and I just waste her space.

I didnt answer, because im used to her arguing. I told my two older brothers today and they told me I should’ve just given her a bit of my food and that I was mean.

"AITA for telling my friend's gf to go home? Burner account so my friends don't find this. 

I (16m) have a small-ish friend group. There's me, my two guy friends from childhood, and now one of them has a gf (16f). They've been dating for like two years now and we've never really gotten along. He says it's bc we're too similar but I just think she's annoying. She's always hanging around and wanting to be involved. She can be mean and she talks back and everyone just thinks its funny but I always seem to be a target. 

This weekend we were hanging out at my house playing video games. She's not really a normal girl and she likes to play with us, and she was literally beating us at everything. It was really starting to annoy me bc I can't remember the last time we hung out without her. I don't think she likes being at home, her family seems kind of shitty but idk how she doesn't have other friends to go be with. 

It was getting late so I told her she should go home. Immediately her bf jumped in and said she didn't have to if she didn't want to. I told her that she had to go bc my mom wouldn't let a girl sleep over. She got mad and said that wasn't fair bc my gf stays over sometimes. It turned into a big argument between all of us. My mom came in and told us to knock it off, and that's when the gf grabbed her stuff and stormed out. Her bf went with her and now he's not talking to me at school.

Our other friend said I was too mean to her and that she's part of the group. I never agreed to her being part of the group. AITA? ",reddit_AmItheAsshole,post,0,2025-11-18 16:30:25,https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1p0okqf/aita_for_telling_my_friends_gf_to_go_home/,388,388,False,384-512
"AITA for not being okay with my mother's boyfriend coming over every two weeks? For context, my mother recently got a new boyfriend. He's a genuinely good guy, me and my sister just don't really get along with him.Important to know is that I am mentally not very stable and he has migrane and lives an hour and a half away, so it makes meeting more difficult for them.

Now.  Without asking any of us, she just decided that he comes over every two weeks for the weekend. The problem is that my sister and I are very introverted and have a big problem with people coming to our house to the point where neither of us leave our room.

We beared with it at first, until he came over and stayed from Sunday to Monday night. My sister and I are still in school and can't get ready if there is someone else in the house, resulting in us not being able to attend school properly and staying at home.

I asked her straight up if she could please not make that repeat. The weekends for our cooldown time is important enough, but our monday morning is essential. But she said that they both liked it better that way and that we have to deal with it, since she's paying the bills.

My sister and I argued that it is absolutely not okay with us and we live here as well. She also gets mad at us to the point of yelling when we don't attend school.

She said that she still hopes we'll get to like him in the future and I straight up told her that I am never going to like someone who interefers with my quiet time on weekends without even considering me and my well-being. She looked quite upset about that.

So, am I the asshole?

EDIT: I get it and hoenstly, I understand. I am never getting anywhere if I don't work on these issues. This might not be like the right place to ask, but does anyone know how to get better with these sorts of things? I don't want to be an asshole and I want to be more comfortable with him.

"AITA for being rude about my uncle after his father (my grandfather) passed For some context my uncle and I never really got on. We both come from an extremely wealthy family but due to my mum and her sister being girls they dont really have any access to the assets while he was set up with businesses, a house etc. We struggled quite a lot financially wise so I always grew up a little bitter towards him for that as he was borrowing against my grandads properties, taking the rent etc.

He eventually got married to a women who is completely awful, she hates our culture, she hates our family and wants my family nowhere near her kids. She was given my grandparents house we all grew up in (worth around 2M), she constantly upset my grandad in his last couple of years especially in regard to his new grandchildren (e.g he would be playing aith his grandson and she would go and pick him up and take him away) She has been pretty rude and awful to our family but they all kiss her ass because shes the wife of the boy.

I started to resent my uncle even more when I found out I had a first cousin that he had with a random women through a dna app, my aunt told him about it and he said he wants nothing to do with it and we were all told not to mention it.

My grandad passed a couple of days ago, everyone was there except me and my brother who had a flight the next day because we had to fly abroad. He was dying and my uncle chose to leave to go home to his wife because she nagged him to come home because she was struggling with the new baby. He got a call after he checked his baggage in that his dad had passed and he left to go home anyway. He has been calling constantly, barking orders at his sisters about the funeral over the phone and overall really getting to me. I have refused to talk to him on FT (just walking away not announcing it) or having anything to do with speaking about him and his new family.

He left my grandad down so much at the end of his life but continues to rinse the family assets and get coddled by everyone and have everyone faunt over him and his wife who is just awful.",reddit_AmItheAsshole,post,8,2025-11-17 18:10:59,https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ozvlfk/aita_for_being_rude_about_my_uncle_after_his/,555,467,True,512-1K
"AITA For telling my boyfriend I think it's weird he takes communion? For context, my boyfriend is Catholic (I am atheist), but he doesn't really subscribe to most church teachings other than to be a good person. He doesn't actively go to church unless he's visiting family, and they alternate between a United and Catholic church because his parents are different denominations. He was confirmed when he was younger in the Catholic church after his parents gave him the option to be either or (he didn't really know what that meant at the time).

He recently mentioned that he does communion at both churches, which struck me as odd. At least for the Catholic one, they seem stricter, and I read once it was bad to do it and not be in a state of grace, which he would not be, unless he went to confession for it.

I called it weird and contradictory, and I said I don't see the point in doing it unless you're gonna do those traditions right.

His reasonings were he likes doing it, they won't know, and it's a free snack. I pointed out it was a rather flippant view for something so serious and he got upset and started talking about how he believes he should, and does at both because he believes in a god that loves and accepts everyone and how he's doing what feels right. He also started talking about how it's humans who are flawed ones more than anything. Aita for saying it was weird to take communion? Should I have just let this issue drop instead of making him upset about it?

Edit: I read that having premarital intimacy disqualifies you from taking communion (at least for Catholics), unless you go to confession. I have said to him before if he went to confession to apologize for being intimate with me that would be a deal breaker. He doesn't go to confession, but he also doesn't feel bad for being with me either.

Edit 2: He doesn't do confession at all. Some people seem to think he is. Also I am a man.

Edit 3: I'm not asking him to stop, but I also think it would make sense to at least respect what's needed if he's going to participate in it.",reddit_AmItheAsshole,post,0,2025-11-18 17:53:58,https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1p0qpyj/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_i_think_its_weird/,533,462,True,512-1K
"AITA for telling people who live near me they can’t use my side gate as a cut through? Here’s a summary:

I’ve been renting this place for 6 months

It’s a back to back house

I’m facing the main road 

The back of the house is on a  cul de sac street

No driveway at the front and can’t park on the main road, so my designated spot is on the driveway round back

Same situation for my detached neighbour, so we share a side gate which we use to get to our vehicles

Many of the residents who live on the cul de sac use the side gate as a cut through when walking to the shops, as it saves them about 1 minute walking this way as opposed to walking the main pathway up the cul de sac and around

When they cut through they walk through my front garden, and sometimes stare in at me while I’m sat in my living room

I’ve never spoken to these residents so they’re basically strangers

When I was coming home one day I kindly asked a woman and her boy not to use my garden to cut through, as they were walking past and didn’t acknowledge me to say hello or anything which is what annoyed me
She had attitude and said they’ve always used it as a cut through, but won’t in future 

I seen today the same woman cutting through again 

Even though I haven’t had any trouble with these residents, it’s been bothering me and not sure how to proceed and can see things potentially escalating as I plan to tell other residents not to use it if I’m out there and catch them 

It feels like an invasion of privacy and inconsiderate of local residents to think my garden is a public right of way without ever speaking to me and asking for my permission to use

Don’t want to put a lock on the gate as it’s a hassle with the neighbour having to use it also

Am I the asshole for thinking like this?


EDIT: Thanks for all the replies. I’ve ordered a sign which will hopefully get the message across. If not I will have to look at installing a lock.",reddit_AmItheAsshole,post,1255,2025-11-16 14:50:15,https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1oyv8ou/aita_for_telling_people_who_live_near_me_they/,488,488,False,384-512
"AITA for not spending Thanksgiving with my family? For context, I (24F) moved out of my parents house for the first time in June and moved into my first apartment with my partner of 8 years (25M). Holiday season is approaching and my partner and I are discussing how we will split the holidays this year. Majority of my family lives in Colombia, the family I have in the US are just my parents and sister, so we usually fly to Colombia for Christmas and New Year’s and spend Thanksgiving at home with friends and neighbors. My partner agreed to come with me to Colombia this year for both Christmas and New Year’s as long as me and him travel down to spend Thanksgiving with his best friend in a different state (his best friend just bought his first house and had a second baby - huge milestones). We hadn’t seen them in 2 years and this was a trip we’d been putting off for a while, so this was a perfect opportunity. I also want to add that I do everything in my power to split my time between my family, my friends, my partner, and my full time job while also leaving time for me to do the things that I enjoy. I talk to my mom nearly every day and I visit my parents and sister every single Sunday, go out to lunch with them and then spend the rest of my day with them, this Sunday was no different, but when I made the announcement at lunch about my Thanksgiving plans, I immediately saw a complete change in my moms attitude. She spent the rest of the day guilt tripping me, telling me “we’re all we have in this country,” and that my decision was selfish. I explained to her why we made the decision to spend Thanksgiving elsewhere, emphasizing the fact that both my partner and I will be spending Christmas and New Year’s with them in a DIFFERENT COUNTRY, but she still does not see reason. She called me that same night to tell me the same things she had been saying all day, calling me selfish, saying she’ll invite my other friends (to make me jealous I guess?) and then she DEMANDED to speak to my partner about it. This infuriated me as I felt like she was treating me like a child, and that my partner speaks for me.",reddit_AmItheAsshole,post,15,2025-11-17 14:05:58,https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ozp54d/aita_for_not_spending_thanksgiving_with_my_family/,661,480,True,512-1K

We sold our boat, everything is paid etc, the buyer will come pick it up in 2 days, they have to sail a day to get to the destination. 

We charged the batteries(like they asked) and one of them emitted a strong sulfur smell (like rotten eggs) which means this battery is dangerous and shouldnt be used.

Now my parents are mad ""the battery still works"" and ""not our problem""

It does power lamps, but safety is important too. Fire protection too.

I told my parents i could change it real quick if they bring a extra battery (i am technical) but they shrug it off and dont care about safety apparently

"AITA for confronting my friend about this? Hi everyone so my friend was complaining to me constantly about not being able to find any nannying/babysitting jobs (she doesn’t even try or look just complains btw) so I finally offered to help her and told her i’d tell my main client whom I see 2-3x a week if her friends were looking. She told me she’d ask and recommend her only after she meets her and sits for her kids once and I thought okay no problem. My friend sits for her and everything goes great, my client tells her friends and they say when we need one they will call my friend. Well then I start noticing she’s babysitting a lot and when I check her location it’s at clients house… At first i’m confused because they’re my clients and didn’t even ask me if I was available on the days she was sitting and i’m also confused bc i’m hired through an agency and we have a contract. Then it starts happening a lot and finally my client tells me my “friend” will message her almost daily asking for shifts because she needs money (for partying) and none of my clients friends text her.

"AITA for not paying house utilities until I get the receipts I'm 21 and still new to living life outside of college. Last month I asked my housemate if he could send me the utility bills statements before I pay him over Venmo. I got the idea from my grandma who said I should have receipts for everything I buy, so I wanted to give that a try.

So I get the Venmo for the bill and there is no statement, and I think ""maybe he just forgot"". This seems like a reasonable excuse since I did ask him over a month ago. So I DM  him ""Please send receipts for the bills so I can pay you 👍"" and I get no response. I think that's weird so the next day I message him the same thing, and I get no response. Yesterday I tried calling him on Messenger, Discord, and over the phone and got no response.

Am I the asshole for refusing to pay bills when I don't see the bill statement? Or is asking to see the bill statement something that I should have been doing from the beginning and now it's coming back to bite me.

Side note: I did ask him for the bill statements back in September and he seemed ""angry"" about it but let me have them. Does asking to see statements make people upset?

"AITA for getting mad at not getting sleep for an important entrance exam? I 16F live in a small house. My parents room and me and my sister's room connect to their room via sliding door cause their room has the AC so it can just waft into our room. This weekend i had a very important exam 8AM. The calltime being 7:30AM. So i needed to wake up at 6am. The night before i ate with them until 12am already accepting i was not getting alot of sleep.

Then everyone went up. I repeatedly ask them nicely to please tone it down and im trying to sleep but no avail. The setup was, me and my sister have a bunk bed. Her bed is a queen sized bed. So my aunt, former estranged older sister was there, and my 4 year old sister, and my sister. So yes there was alot of shuffling and screaming for my 4 year old sister to come sleep.

So i was fed up i wanted to cry. I went up bringing a blanket, pillow, and my phone. I went to the guest bedroom that has no AC and was extremely hot. I forgot my charger and i went to my room and saw my uncle in my bed. I think everyone visibly saw i was annoyed or exhausted and felt embarassed.

I woke up that morning exhausted as i had slept at 2:30 - 3AM. I woke up annoyed and exhausted told my dad home felt like a boarding house. I was pretty rude i admit that. Then my grandmother chimed in saying i won't be blessed, and my dad agreed. I went to the car and didn't talk to him. I came home 12pm everyone was still asleep i fell asleep in the study room until 9pm.

Later that night he did family bible devotions and made me read verses about endurance and being thankful that everyone was loud because they were happy.

"AITAH for rehoming a kitten that my friend has ignored? My (31f) boyfriend's (29m) cat had kittens in July. My bf lives with his uncle in a small house along with his aunt, cousin, and his uncles friend. Momma cat had five kittens, at first the cousin wanted to keep them but as they got older she refused to take care of them properly so my bf and I stepped in. In exchange we claimed the kittens as ours. As they got bigger his uncle told us that they needed to go, they're too big and too many. He also was actively trying to rehome momma cat. 

I started asking friends and coworkers if they wanted a kitten for cheap, my bf and i had each picked a kitten to keep. One of my coworkers took a kitten, and one of my friends took a kitten. 

Let's call this friend Siv (30f). Siv and I agreed that I would foster her kitten until she moved into a pet friendly place, time limit one year. We also agreed she would pay me at the beginning of every month for expenses for her kitten, with the understanding that rhe price would increase as she got bigger, and that she would pick up the kitten one day on the weekends. 

Everything started out fine, Siv and her friend Andy would come pick up the kitten every Sunday and we would take her home. I was unaware that they were only playing with the kitten in Andy's car, not letting the kitten out unless it was to use the bathroom. When I found out I made a point to tell Siv that she couldn't keep doing that and the kitten needed more space to play and explore. As time went on Siv started canceling her weekend pick ups in favor of doing other things. She was sick and didn't want the responsibility, she wanted to go to the Ren fair, a few times she just no showed and didnt communicate. At the end of October I blew up at her, told her that what she was doing wasn't fair to me or the cat and she had agreeded to every weekend with the exception of two holidays. 

She blew up on me the following weekend because I didn't allow her to come get the kitten after she didn't show for three weekends in a row. Cussed me out and then turned the anger towards our friendship which was rocky at best.",reddit_AmItheAsshole,post,19,2025-11-17 11:04:24,https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ozk5u5/aitah_for_rehoming_a_kitten_that_my_friend_has/,676,501,True,512-1K

I'm autistic and have migranes that oddly stem form that due to me hearing sounds at a decibel people shouldn't be hearing, such as hearing dog whistles. I'm in year 11 and for my school life have always struggled with school. 

I've had a vestibular migraine for around 2-3 months non stop and it feels like it's getting worse, ive been diagnosed for 2 years and am about to get help in december. I've been struggling with homework for a long time though. 

I was in one of my classes at the end of the day and got taken down to my homework detention, which i hadn't had the sheet to complete until the day before when i felt ill so i did not do it. I cannot do after school detentions as i need to walk home and do a bunch of stuff. As someone who is autistic for me this in general is stressful without detentions. Anyway, i got sidetracked. I went to the detention simply to explain my situation. One of the teachers, who I'll call Mr Michael (not his real name), was speaking to me. And he made the point of 'we can legally keep you here either way', once i had explained that my mother had signed a form saying i cannot do these detentions. Of course i begin to stress as i was already unwell and had fallen down some stairs earlier that day and hurt myself, so i desperately wanted my teddy which is my comfort object to make me calm down. The situation continued until my maths teacher came in who i began to explain the situation to. Normally i see her as quite kind, however i believe she may have been in a bad mood. She proceeds to lecture me on the fact that I'm in year 11. After a bit i begin to feel annoyed. Not long later she choses to tell me I'm 'not doing good enough'. I begin to cry and immediately tell her nothing is good enough for her and i leave. However, an added fact to this is that whilst she was lecturing me on this another teacher was trying to talk to me so i was getting seriously overwhelmed and unsure what to do.

"AITA for telling my baby’s father that I didn’t want him bringing his other child to a daycare field trip after he hasn’t seen her in months? So I (26F) have a toddler with my ex. Our co-parenting has been rocky from the start because he’s extremely inconsistent. He’ll go months without seeing her, then suddenly want to be involved, then disappear again. For almost two years it’s basically just been me doing everything alone. Shortly after finding out I was pregnant he decided to get his new girlfriend pregnant because she was upset that he was having a baby with me.

Recently, after not seeing the baby for months, he asked if he could come to her daycare field trip to see her for about 1–2 hours. I agreed because I genuinely want her to have a relationship with her dad if he’s going to show up consistently and not just when it’s convenient.

But then, last minute, he said he wanted to bring his younger child with him due to conveniently no longer having a babysitter, we’re four days out from the field trip btw.

I told him I didn’t think it was appropriate for him to bring another child not because anything is wrong with the other kid, but because this visit should be about reconnecting with the baby, especially since he’s been absent. It’s already a limited amount of time, and a daycare environment with multiple kids is chaotic enough. Adding his other child feels like yet another distraction that takes the focus off rebuilding that bond.

not to mention, my daughter is never included in plans with his other child. There was a huge fight to have the new child at her first birthday party and I agreed for the peace he ended up spending the entire party, consoling the baby and left early…. for the babies’s first birthday, our child was not invited. There has been consistent plans made on holidays that do not include our child. He gets one on one time with the other child 24/7 and as I said before, doesn’t see our child consistently at all. I’m just trying to set boundaries that make sense and protect our child emotionally.

Now I’m wondering if I handled it wrong.AITA for not saying yes to his other child attending?

"AITA for telling my dad that I don’t care about making him proud? I(17) am an affair baby. Dad and I only see each other one day a month. He said it was difficult enough to get his wife to agree to that and that he didn’t want to push it. He told me when I’m married I’ll understand compromise.

One of the two worst things that happened to our relationship was when his wife said I seem quite well read ‘for a waitress’ son.’ Have my grandpa to thank for buying me books, I suppose. My dad didn’t say anything. I could understand her disdain given that Dad did cheat on her with my mom but his silence stung. The other was when I came out and he said maybe I was ‘just confused’ and should try dating his friend’s daughter. He did give up on the idea but things just haven’t been the same. I just don’t know what to say or how to act around him.

He said he wants me to study abroad in the US or the UK and told me to take an IELTS exam. I took the exam and didn’t do very well in it. Dad accused me of deliberately doing badly so I could stay with my boyfriend(17). I told him I did my best and he said I should’ve tried harder to make him proud. I snapped. I told him I don’t actually care about making him proud and.

"AITA for ignoring my mom? I, 16F am currently ignoring my mom because of what she
said to me.
Two days ago I was hanging out with my mom and her
husband. I’ll call him Phil. And she got a text from her
friend asking for her and PhiI to hangout that night. She
then asked I me if I wanted to watch my siblings (twin boys, very young ages) and said ""no not rlly"" bc I didn’t want to.
She didn’t like that answer and said “well I was just asking
to sound nice, be happy I’m not cussing you out and
slapping you bc thats what my mom used to do”
Phil was agreeing with her, even laughing a little.

She’s said stuff like this before. asking me, I say no, but
still making me do it.
I straight up just told her to stop asking me and just tell me
instead because, I thought it was pointless. And ig she
didn’t like that answer and got mad? I don’t know why tbh.
She then called me a ""fucking weirdo"" which upset me and
I just left the room. I watched my siblings AND put them both to bed that night.
 
and same night she made cookies, texted me to tell me
she made them. (something we’ve been doing for a few
weeks now)
But last night, she made cookies, but didn’t tell me that
time, l assumed they were for me since it was only two
left. I waited to eat them bc I just ate snacks. Fast-forward
to later, they ate them. And that iust made it worse bc she
always made them for all of us!

But it’s been two, almost three days and I haven’t said a
word to her and I feel like she doesn’t care and I don’t feel
loved by her as her child. She’s only been texted me saying ""dinner is ready"" or ""food in the kitchen"" and I have not replied to her.

"AITA for letting my teenage son attend 'Dads night' for his youngest sibling? My 8yo Sams school regularly has 'special person days' for grandparents, father figures and mother figures.
It's extremely inclusive, stepdads /grandfathers/uncles attend as well. For example one of my son's friends is raised by his aunty and uncle, who attend the mother/father figure days. An older friend of mine attends the grandparent days with my kids, because my parents are 6 hours away.

A few weeks ago they had a 'escape room' themed night for father figures. It's sponsored by local mens organisations, and very popular in our community.

My older son attended with Sam, when Sam asked him too because Sam wanted to do the escape room.

He was not the only older sibling there.

The school posted photos to the Facebook page, and my ex husband saw. He is claiming alienation and that I'm cutting him out of their lives.
However 
1. He works away 2/1, and can't come back outside of emergencies.
2. When the dates lined up a few months ago, he didn't take our youngest because he was too tired.
So he couldn't have gone, and didn't want to last time he was invited.

I understand he's upset about missing out, but Sam shouldn't have to stay home just because dad isn't home.

AITA for letting my son attend for Sam?


(I'm not worried about the alienation claims as I have records with all visitation and communication, and *I* pushed for 50/50 when we divorced, but he didn't want that. He is free to see the children as much as he wants and he currently chooses 2-3 days of his week off. The kids have keys for both houses and we are close enough that they  ride bikes/take the bus between houses, (and the older 3 always have spending money and full bus cards so that's not stopping them from visiting) so are free to visit wheneve. Before we worked away, he saw them every second weekend, by his choice.)

I’m 20F and there are these shoes that I love wearing, they are heels but just a little big on me as I asked my mom if I could have them from her because I love them.

I wear them to college on a daily basis, I have a few friends who I talk to but one of them really hates the fact that I wear them.

Whenever I wear them she gets really upset and lectures me and while I appreciate that she cares, I really love these shoes and have told her a few times that I’ve been fine wearing them.

Yesterday I was gone for the afternoon to attend a parent-teacher conference for our 15yo daughter in another town. My husband was home and was supposed to pick our youngest daughter (7yo) up from school and send her off to swimming class with my mom before going to his first responder course. I packed the daughter's bag and coordinated with my mom, reminded my husband about pickup at 14:30 before I boarded the bus at 13:45. 

Husband FORGOT to pick her up, didn't think to ask where she was until 16:00. At that point he didn't even go to search for her, but sent our 10yo son to look for her near the school (It's walking distance but at 7 daughter is too young to cross the road on her own). She was at the playground near the school. She was unattended for 2 hours and missed swimming class.

I was extremely upset. I feel like my husband was grossly irresponsible and incompetent here.   
He refuses to acknowledge the seriousness of what happened. According to hhimI was supposed to call from the bus and tell him ""now it's time to get into the car and pick her up.""

Some back detail, for context.. we have a history of stimulant use that causes sex drive to sky rocket but can also put both of us in a very foggy state of not quite awake, not quite asleep. I (34f - B)have BPD and been working on trusting things I'm told at face value because in the past I've completely questioned my entire existence, what I see and what I hear because I trusted who was saying it and I was being lied to. I've worked very hard to over come these issues. I have also come to terms with my sleeping personality who is extremely sexual and has been known to engage in numerous sexual encounters with my (33f, gf - K) that I completely am unaware of until I'm told about it and the following morning. Like, I'm asleep so I don't know wtf I'm doing and believed every time my gf has said it happened, w/o question. My gf and I were getting on sexy topics and I proceeded to tell her about a night where we had partaken and I had been laying next to her, wide awake, when I heard her (k) start moaning a little. I got a little frisky and started enjoying some me time with this new found excitement. She proceeded to start sexually sucking on her fingers in a very suggestive way, while quietly moaning. I was very turned on and was thuroughly enjoying it. But any time there was a slight noise, k would stop moaning and stop sucking for a good minute and then continue. Which made me think maybe she was awake and just playing with herself and not realizing I was awake to witness this whole thing? 
So as I'm telling her this thing that very much turned me on, and I was fully awaketo witness, she got so defensive and adamant that she KNOWS her body well enough to know that she DOES NOT AND HAS NEVER played with herself next to me in her sleep or awake and I was clearly lucid dreaming and I was wrong and she demanded I agreed she was right.",reddit_AmItheAsshole,comment,1,2025-11-19 16:17:04,https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1p1k524/aita_34f_for_asking_my_33f_long_term_gf_to_agree/npqhxxa/,743,488,True,512-1K

"CMV: Trump is now willing to support the House's vote on the Epstein files release because he has had the DOJ classify all records where he is mentioned. TLDR: Trump is now willing to support the Epstein file release bill because he had the FBI review all files and flag where he is mentioned, and has had all of those files classified. They will not be released when the bill passes, and he will use the release to prosecute only his political enemies mentioned in the files, rather than all co-conspirators.

The bill [requires Attorney General Bondi to release](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxr1r34ev9o) “all ***unclassified*** records, documents, communications, and investigative materials” related to Epstein and his co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell no later than 30 days after the law is enacted. 

**Key Details:** 

1) Trump was vehemently opposed to this bill for months, and although it might have narrowly passed the House originally, Senate Majority Leader John Thune originally [indicating](https://x.com/mkraju/status/1963642454399148472) he would not bring it to a vote, making it unlikely to go anywhere. However, Trump's opposition only intensified as the discharge petition in the House gained momentum, until he suddenly reversed course.

2) Trump fought this bill for months, calling it a 'Democrat Hoax' and threatening Republicans who supported it. Yet within 72 hours, he went from calling Marjorie Taylor Greene a 'traitor' for supporting release to endorsing the bill himself. This rapid reversal only makes sense if he's confident any damaging materials relating to him won't be released. 

3) Back in March, when there was a big push to have the Epstein files released, there were reports that [agents from the FBI field office in New York were assigned to comb through the Epstein files and](http://cnbc.com/2025/07/18/trump-epstein-fbi-durbin.html) ""were instructed to “flag” any documents that mentioned President Donald Trump, Sen.",reddit_changemyview,post,1181,2025-11-19 10:42:37,https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1p1b19n/cmv_trump_is_now_willing_to_support_the_houses/,921,460,True,512-1K
"CMV: Countries banning the burqa are doing the right thing Portugal recently proposed a bill to ban the use of the burqa in public spaces and it caused an uproar across the country mainly amongst the leftists youth. While it is true that burqas are not an issue in pt and that the rise of right within the country is becoming more prominent which is scary, this is one of the few things that have done right and it should be celebrated. 

There is absolutely *nothing* in Islam that states that a burqa or niqab are required or even recommended, it is a purely misogynistic practice and people with those radical and irrational beliefs should never be allowed in europe or anywhere in the west. There’s even muslim countries that also ban the use of these garments and that should already speak volumes. 
Anyone that claims to be a feminist or for gender equality should agree and support the banning of these ridiculous practices and if you don’t, you’re a hypocrite and most of all you’re fake and uneducated. Misogyny and oppression do not become okay just because it’s being carried out by non whites or non christians and standing against it *does not* make you Islamophobic or racist. It only makes you consistent in your beliefs, as one should be.

"CMV: the lesson of the Trump era is that we must get rid of the two party system. If one of the parties in a two party system loses its commitment to democracy it is not in the other party’s power or control to maintain the democracy on its own. Even if the other party wins in the short term, voters will eventually want to vote against the status quo/party in power.  That is not even considering the pressure that the “good” party will be under to loosen its own commitments to democratic principles in its effort to keep power away from the “bad” party. 

The caveat is that the voters of a given democracy can squash a party that begins moving in that direction and punish it electorally such that the offending party learns its lesson, but if the voters fail to give a clear enough message then the democracy will remain on shaky ground indefinitely. 

It’s really as simple as that. A two party system must have parties that are committed to a certain level of shared principles and values in order to remain viable. The more polarized the parties become the weaker the democracy will be, and once one of the parties breaks its commitment to democratic principles the chances that the democracy will fail multiply to a significant degree. 



While it is not part of the CMV I can’t leave the “solution” out, because there is one if only enough people pushed for it. Either party could split itself into two new parties in one or more states where they have unified control. They could do this unilaterally because they would have the power to pass election reforms that would enable multi party competition (Alaska’s system is the model imo). 

These two new parties would eliminate the need for the legacy party’s two factions to compete for which will lead the party and lead its messaging and would free both up to compete more effectively for any voters tempted to vote for the “bad” party. The two new parties would, together, have more appeal than the original one, and would be able to compete more effectively against the “bad” party.",reddit_changemyview,post,72,2025-11-19 13:22:18,https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1p1fecy/cmv_the_lesson_of_the_trump_era_is_that_we_must/,730,443,True,512-1K
"CMV: Sudan is NOT and NEVER WILL BE an Arab country, it is a VICTIM of Arab colonialism. Yes, this will be political and historical, but... y'all got to stick with me for this one, and no, I am not being ""paid by the West"" or ""paid by Israel"" to try and ""destroy the Arab world"", so please do not start with those responses.

Everyone is now talking about Sudan, the country who is currently suffering from a ""civil war"", but... the problem is that people often ignore the root causes of Sudan's conflicts, and Arabization/Arab Colonialism is one of them, and a MAJOR issue.

Sudan's history spans from ancient civilizations, the earliest ones being Kush -- a native East African kingdom, to the current war today.

We all know about the Arab conquest of Sudan during the Medieval period, which transitioned Sudan into an Arabized African country, so I shall talk about Arabization during the modern creation of Sudan.

As we all know, Sudan had also been a British colony for many years (yes... we all know how British colonialism affects many countries...). After Sudan's independence, it was a united country. However, during those years, many non-Arab ethnic groups, especially the ones in the South, and that prompted multiple civil wars that eventually led to the southern portion of Sudan formally breaking away from the north in 2011.

Now, let's bring it back to the current ""civil war""... it's not, actually.

The main aggressors in the Sudan War are: The RSF & The United Arab Emirates.

One of the RSF's beliefs is to arabize Sudan even more, which means that the ethnic groups in North Sudan who are not considered ""Arab"" will immediately be ethnically cleansed and genocided. This is more than a civil war, this is neocolonialism. And guess what? The United Arab Emirates is OBVIOUSLY funding the RSF for this. There is so much evidence.

The RSF have killed, pillaged, and r\*ped HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of non-Arab civilians in Sudan. This is another GENOCIDE of non-Arab minorities by this Arab supremacist group.

So, no. Sudan is not Arab and should never be considered Arab. Look how all the other Arab countries are treating Sudan.",reddit_changemyview,post,748,2025-11-18 23:29:28,https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1p0y1og/cmv_sudan_is_not_and_never_will_be_an_arab/,610,506,True,512-1K
"CMV: All drugs should be legal at the federal level Title is a good summery. This is actually a very recent view of mine, which I was opposed to just about a year ago. But it hit me me recently while my husband and I were watching a documentary about drug cartels. 

So the train of thought is this. If drugs were legalized:

* Legal retailers would move in and competition would kill price gouging on drugs. The violence and smuggling within cartels is not cheap, so without inflated prices, they would almost definitely no longer be profitable unless taxes on legal drugs were very high. And most people would infinitely prefer to just go to a dispensary than go through the rigmarole of obtaining them illegally. This would end a huge level of violence and save taxpayer dollars spent on trying to regulate drugs.
* Regulation would largely wipe out the fentanyl as people could hold brands and suppliers accountable. People may still be doing bad drugs, may still be addicts, but there would be fewer causalities, and I think that's worth it.
* For people who are *already doing illegal drugs*, more doors are opened to recovery, therapy, and rehab. A lot of people struggling with addiction want to quit and don't have the resources to—you won't exactly feel comfortable seeking mental health support if the stuff you are doing is illegal. And there's a whole industry exploiting these people by offering fake ""rehab,"" and then siphoning huge amounts of money from their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. Decriminalization would allow for that money to go to real treatment far more often.
* It also opens the door to building cultural expectations around drugs, which I think would do a lot for current addicts and to control the circumstances surrounding how new people get into the stuff. Someone who might have tried drugs anyway may now chose to do so in a controlled environment because that is deemed socially acceptable. That person is less likely to become an addict and they are in a far safer environment.
* It opens to door to better education. Right now a lot of people tiptoe around the topic as soon as it goes past weed. I think that allows for more people to get sucked into illegal substances because they don't have any mental ""antibodies,"" so to speak.

The most obvious counterargument is that this opens the door to addictive substances to some people who never would have gotten involved in the first place.",reddit_changemyview,post,24,2025-11-19 14:29:14,https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1p1h9ey/cmv_all_drugs_should_be_legal_at_the_federal_level/,708,497,True,512-1K
"CMV: Dave Chappelle got lazy with age and money Dave Chappelle has started punching down, despite making a stand-up special against it. Making fun of minorites like gays and trans people is one thing, but treating them as lesser people makes you a lesser person. He has the right to say what he wants, that's not the issue. The core issue here is not 'offense' versus 'humor,' but a critique of platform and power. When a global figure with the cultural capital and financial security of Chappelle targets a community that is demonstrably systemically marginalized and vulnerable—a community facing legislative attacks and high rates of violence—the comedic act ceases to be merely a critique of culture and morphs into a reinforcement of existing oppression. 

Dave Chappelle is a genius. So he knows better. He can, and should, do better. He's faced a lot of hatred as a black person. But as we sometimes see with minorities, including gay and trans people, hatred can go both ways. We have to actively work to stop the flow of hate.

"CMV: H-1B workers are too few to affect U.S. wages, but losing them would hurt innovation and research H-1B visa holders make up only about 0.3–0.4% of the entire U.S. workforce, so eliminating them wouldn’t noticeably change employment or wages for American workers. Even in the most affected sectors: Professional, Scientific & Technical Services (0.64%), Information (0.28%), Finance & Insurance (0.12%), and Manufacturing (0.10%) their share is tiny. But the loss would still damage the national interest, because nearly half of all postdocs in the U.S. depend on visas. 

International student enrollment is already dropping 17% this year. I don't even wanna start with the argument that “a university funded by foreign students does not deserve to stay in business.” Think about it this way: originally, the school did not have many international students paying tuition, so it operated on a budget of about 10B. As more international students enrolled, the budget grew to about 15B. Because of that increase, the school built more classrooms and research facilities and relied less on taxpayer money.

If they cut off international enrollment, the budget would return to the original 10B, but the school would still need to spend additional money to maintain the new buildings that were constructed for a larger student population. That would be completely unreasonable.

If the H-1B program collapses, thousands of highly trained researchers may leave or never arrive, worsening talent shortages in STEM and academia. By contrast, the largest family-based green card category has no skill or job requirements, allowing far more low-skill workers—around 6–7 times more than H-1Bs to enter the labor force. Only 46% of employment-based green card recipients were principal workers, while 54% were dependents, meaning there are 2.5% of our workforce is low skill low wage green card holders.

If our immigration system overwhelmingly admits non-skilled labor while making it difficult for specialized professionals to stay, we risk undermining both innovation and U.S. competitiveness.

"CMV: Retail and fast food surveys do not accomplish anything except give the false impression that the company cares what you think and has no impact on the business. I’m interested to see if anyone can challenge my view on this.

For context, I’ve worked both as a worker and a middle manager for fast food and retail companies. One of the biggest things workers and the store itself are graded on is surveys filled out by customers, but ultimately they make no difference to the company itself, and do not promote change. It’s a pointless metric companies wave around. 

On the business level, I’ve heard that satisfied customers are repeat customers. I believe that to be true. That said, unless the survey is done anonymously, we can typically see how many times a customer has done a survey of their rewards account or some other similar incentive was linked to the transaction. Hypothetically let’s say a John Smith continually leaves 1 star surveys. We can see exactly how many times this same customer has left us 1 Star. We have several customers who have commented “will not be back!” Over and over again for years. 

Additionally, people can leave a low scoring survey for anything and attempt to justify it any way. I’ve seen plenty of “does not carry [insert brand] or [insert menu item]” as if that’s something that we can control from the store level. I’ve seen, more than once, someone level a great review and accidentally gives us 1 star. 

There is no point in offering surveys from a business standpoint because they generally do not give you a good indication how how people feel about a business, and there is no point in filling them out because most of the problems you experience at a store will not be resolved with a bad survey.

For decades I've enjoyed being part of the internet, its social media, the ever changing cultures and yes, even the sometimes mind numbing stuff like Reddit and Imgur et cetera. I've mostly been entertained and I gave my creativity and much of my open source work and art in return for others to use or enjoy.

Search for a topic -or facts- on a search engine and you'll be fed all made up AI slop. Look for a video on youtube or facts on google and you'll just get big turds of disinformation that AI shat out. None of it is useful or to be trusted, most of it's complete bullshit and it fucks up the entire point of what the internet is about.

Saying this, I have seen a lot of people around me and online saying either ""democrats want to let illegal immigrants run free in the country"" or stuff like ""the conservatives want to force a raped woman to have to carry out a pregnancy"" or stuff like that basically saying khow the other side is the problem. This is damaging because then each side only gets a skewed perception of the opposing arguments, and it just makes the political divide even stronger. This makes it hard to have a civil discussion about politics, because each side thinks the other is fundamentally evil sometimes. This also makes it easy for someone like trump to get into power because he feeds the people fear of the radical left, and then they vote him into power and now hes doing crazy stuff that he shouldn't do.

I probably could have said this much better, but basically, the perception of extremism in both directions just further entrenches extremist views and causes problems within the people of our nation.

"CMV: if there is anything truly exceptional about America, it is it’s multiculturalism The only thing truly exceptional about America is that fact that it has literally been built and sustained by immigrants. There is no other country on earth right now that isn’t in some way built along some ethnic/religious/linguistic lines. America is the only place whose “identity” is so deeply intertwined with that of so many cultures across the world that it is genuinely hard to pin down ethnically (even the people who are trying to do that now know that if everyone other than English speaking white Christians left the US, there wouldn’t be much left of it). 

So yes America is truly exceptional, but what is exceptional about it is its multiculturalism. 

EDIT1: I am rethinking my stance because of mentions of Australia and Canada. But I’d still argue that the sheer of scale immigration alone doesn’t make a place multicultural, if immigrants remain in their own cultural bubbles (which is very much the case in Canada). Even if Australia and Canada have a lot of immigrants, what is different in the case of the US is the coming together of people from different cultures to create a multicultural identity. To my knowledge that is not the case with AZ and CA. 

EDIT2: multicultural =/= lots of immigrants. Maybe “essentially pluralist” would be a better way to put it. And yes I do agree that Canada and Australia are similar, but there a big difference in scale and pervasiveness.

"CMV: Democracy Works Best When Stupid People Can't Vote Most people are far less capable of independent thought than they believe, and society would function better if we openly acknowledged that some people should not have decision-making power over important matters. The idea that everyone's opinion is equally valuable is a feel-good lie. Some people are simply more competent, rational, and informed than others, and giving disproportionate influence to the uninformed or irrational drags everything down.

This reality becomes glaringly obvious when you observe how most people make decisions. Most people have an inability to think critically or verify sources of information they allow to guide their beliefs - they rely instead on gut feelings, follow social media trends, or parrot whatever their preferred news source tells them without any critical analysis. The average voter can't explain basic economic principles, doesn't understand how government actually works, yet feels entitled to have equal say in policies that affect millions of lives. 

If the goal is a society that works, then decisions should be shaped by those who can demonstrate they understand what’s at stake, not just those who shout the loudest or appeal to emotion. Equal worth as individuals does not mean equal weight in decision-making.

Democracy requires consensus decision-making and compromise, which requires a lot of people who have opposing views to work well with each other within the system. That ensures that parties that have significant constituencies can be represented, but like all big committees of people who have widely different views (and might even dislike each other), the decision-making system is not efficient.

The biggest risk to democracies is that they produce such fragmented and antagonistic decision making that they can be ineffective, which leads to bad results, and out of disorder and discontent come leaders who have strong personalities, are anti-elitist, and claim to fight for the common man (e.g., see the current orange menace at the white house). 

This is the major flaw in democracy, change my view.

"CMV: Gavin Newsome is a poor choice for a presidential candidate. To clarify, I love Gavin Newsom, and I think he is great in the current US political climate. Edit2: I take this back, he's scum. See end of my post.

So I've heard a lot of talk about Newsom as the next DNC presidential candidate due to his effectiveness against Trunp, but I feel like the very reasons he is effective against him are why he shouldn't be leader. 

He is what the DNC needs now - the GOP has thrown any semblance of decorum and respect, and the weights and measures that are supposed to control the executive branch are essentially based on good faith assumptions that they will respect the other branches and institutions. Newsom's willingness to hit Trump where it hurts him (his massive ego) with social media trolling etc work a lot better than a judge calling out Trump.

There's something to be said for fighting at the enemies level when it works, but there is also something to be said about not picking your leaders on the enemy's terms. Newsom is arrogant and as much as I like him it comes off as childish when he 'trolls' Trump, even if it is effective. He is helpful now, but going forward, the DNC needs someone who can treat their office with the respect it deserves, not hand the title to a leader who jokes about being called God.

I am Canadian and the biggest relief for me when Mark Carney was elected was that it was someone professional. I want politics to be boring, not full of personal feuds.

Change my view. I want to know if this is me just hoping the US can return to political decorum, or if that hope is misplaced and US politics just needs to keep being the sitcom drama it is. I'd love to hear the opinions of both Americans living through this and non-Americans observing it.

"CMV: sticking it out for the kids is the worst thing you can do for a child and needs to stop normalizing it Super long title my apologies,

Ultimately I keep seeing people who decided to “stick it out for the kids” and it seems so stupid to me. I do want another point of view on how this could benefit a child in the long run because so far I just see negatives to this and how there’s no real benefit. I had a friend once (were no longer friends), who had parents who tried to stick it out for the kids. It ended up not working for them and they decided to separate after three kids and it led to so many issues due to them sticking it out as long as they did. Ultimately my friend had the most trauma because she was the oldest. She was born when her parents were 17 years old. Her parents weren’t happy together but stuck it out for her. Then about two years later accidentally got pregnant with her little brother. They had him really thought “well we have two kids they need two parents to function” so they stuck it out a little longer. Ended up having their final kid together which was another daughter. They realize it wasn’t fair to her to stay together.

By the time they finally separated the damage had been done. Their oldest child is left with so much trauma she refuses to get into a relationship, even though she really wants to find love the best example of love is her stepdad and mom. The lesson she learned is your first relationship will always be toxic but your second one might not be as toxic. Then again at her dad’s house, her dad and step mom have hour long yelling matches. Her example of healthy relationships is so conflicting she just won’t do it for her own well being. Especially if kids are brought into the mix just seems too risky. Her brother has a similar view on relationships so he’s following his sister’s footsteps. Their youngest sister has no trauma from this because her parents didn’t stick it out for her. 

I have friends whose parents divorced before they were born, and they had happier childhoods. This is due to not having parents that “stuck it out” for them. Then there’s the friends who have parents still trying to stick it out to this day which have proven to be more negative than positive from my position.",reddit_changemyview,post,36,2025-11-18 10:36:52,https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1p0f3bg/cmv_sticking_it_out_for_the_kids_is_the_worst/,799,505,True,512-1K
"CMV: Solitary Confinement should replace Death Penalty I am (obviously) not an expert in this field but I'd like to debate this topic for the following reasons. This is strictly for replacing death penalty only. Thank you in advance. 

1. Argument: 

Death penalty is too easy for the convicted. They are essentially spared years of prolonged suffering. Punishments should be designed to be feared to deter crime. 

2. Counter Argument: It is torture. 

Of course and SC should be limited to those committing the worst of atrocities that they are warranted the DP. SC must be served to the convicted with utmost caution. I guess there's no way to not sound like a sadist but punishments are meant to be punishing. They are meant to deter uncivilized behavior. And clearly death penalty hasn't warranted the same effect. 

3. Counter Argument: It will torment them which will make them unfit for rehabilitation, which is the whole point of prisons.

If they commit a crime so heinous (involving manslaughter etc) that they deserve a death penalty, they shouldn't be given the chance to live their own life.

"CMV: Millennials (1985 onward) and Gen-Z should be considered the same generation. There is a lot to consider when deciding when a generation starts and ends, and there will also be arguments for and against start and end dates and there will always be people born in the transition periods.  The big things attributed to millennials is that we grew up when technology/computers/the internet because part of our daily life.  Gen-Z is often delineated by the fact that technology is native to their life.  For millennials, we grew up in a world that transitioned into the information age.  Gen-Z was born into a world where the transition already occurred. 

When you zoom out a bit tough, Millennials and Gen-Z seem to be much more closely related to each other compared to past generations.  We share much of the same cultural attitudes pertaining to politics, our relationship to work, relationships to past generations (Ok, Boomer), etc.  I think the biggest thing is that our experience of the world has been remarkably similar.  Millennials grew up in a world that transitioned into the information age around the time we were older kids. Most people didn't have computers when we were 6 years old.  Everyone had them when we were teens.  Likewise, nobody had smartphones when Gen-Z was 5, everyone had them when they were teens.  We both had a major culture/life changing event affect our late teen years (9/11, COVID) that significantly changed our outlook on the world and restricted what we could do.  We both had major economic events hit just as we entered our professional years (Great Recession, COVID Shutdown-inflation). Due to their longevity, we've both been fighting boomers our entire lives in terms of cultural norms, workplace norms, politics, etc.  Due to social media, we've also all been living in the same social ecosystem.  You may have even seen a lot of posts/commentary lately about how music, clothing, pop culture in general hasn't changed much in the past 20 years (compared to past decades where there were very clear differences between decades).  Another thing that has broken the historical breakdown of generational lines is the age at which we have children.  Because it's become more normal for women to have children later, the range of parental age for any given child is very wide.",reddit_changemyview,post,0,2025-11-19 15:33:21,https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1p1izks/cmv_millennials_1985_onward_and_genz_should_be/,650,487,True,512-1K
CMV: Posts on Reddit shouldn’t be taken at face value Recently I saw a post on Reddit about a man who left his kid in a hot car while watching porn. Now a father did leave his child in the car and that child did unfortunately die. However he was sleeping not watching porn. And the father later committed suicide after being arrested. There was no reason to embellish the story. And the father was incredibly reckless leaving a child in the car with AC on while he slept. But for some reason the poster needed to lie about him watching porn. Same thing with posts about women talking about their narcissistic abusive ex. First off all narcissists are quite rare and tend to be off putting.

"CMV: American Politics don't exist without checks and balances. TLDR: Humans follow the path of least resistance to what they perceive as survival/power, meaning, in the absence of checks on power, there are no real politics.

I say American politics as clickbait, but it's an anthropological argument that applies to all countries. I accept 90% prediction accuracy as sufficient.

Klitgaard's formula Corruption = Monopoly + discretion - transparency can be proxied into action taken = Discretion - challengers.

An example of this thesis would be stating that if a group controls all checks on them, IE the OIG, the prosecutors, judges, et cetera, then politics have ended and political discussion is irrelevant. They will exhaust all resources to keep power. Even if you cater to them, they will only use you to sabotage other partisanships until you yourself are not a threat, meaning the net present value of lobbying is zero.

"CMV: Decriminalization and the destigmatization of drugs will never solve the drug crisis Coming from a place where the drug crisis is probably one of, if not the worst, in the world right now, I struggle to understand people that maintain the opinion that the destigmatization and decriminalization of drugs are the best ways of solving the drug crisis.

The viewpoint I commonly see these advocates share is that we need to treat the problem with empathy. If people are less shameful about their addictions, than perhaps they would be willing to get the support they need. Additionally, the introduction of a ""safe supply"" of drugs would help ensure they take clean products to satiate their addiction while continuously getting support, with the hope that they will one day eventually break their addiction and reintegrate into society. 

A lot of advocates also refer to Portugal's drug policy, where they had a Heroin problem in 2001 and decriminalized the usage of drugs and looked at them as patients instead of criminals. Ultimately, this was a very successful policy and addictions fell rapidly.  


Now I don't necessarily disagree with being empathetic, but the way they are proposing it is flawed in my opinion. I could go on-and-on as to why this is (spoilers: it hasn't worked where I live and it has gotten significantly worse), but I'll cite a couple reasons:

1. The drug crisis has gotten so bad that we simply don't have the resources and human capital available to effectively tackle the problem from a rehabilitative standpoint. There are too many addicts out there and not enough people that would ever want to do this line of work.

2. Portugal was successful in 2001 because Heroin is a mere fragment as addictive as the synthetic opioid drugs that are on the streets right now. People don't understand how incredibly addictive these drugs are - there is a saying that once you've tried it once, you're addicted for life. Unfortunately, I believe the vast majority of users addicted to these type of drugs like fentanyl have a very slim chance of recovery, almost to the point of futility. For every one person that comes clean, there will be hundreds more that will become addicted if the inflow of drugs continues

As a result, these safe supply facilities may work for people that are addicted to heroin, but aren't going to work for addicts of fentanyl.",reddit_changemyview,post,7,2025-11-18 17:10:44,https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1p0pmhs/cmv_decriminalization_and_the_destigmatization_of/,628,492,True,512-1K
"CMV: watching videos/listening to music without headphones at a reasonable volume is totally acceptable. Before you get to it, I want to be very specific. Blasting a speaker on a public bus or other enclosed area is a dick move. Watching a video with obnoxious screaming at a high volume is a dick move. Playing anything with inappropriate content (porn, violence, slurs, swearing, etc.) is a dick move. I'm guessing we can all mostly agree on that. 

Where I think I'll disagree with some people is that fundamentally, I don't see how it's ""wrong"" to, say, listen to a podcast at a reasonable volume with no headphones on on the bus. And if you disagree, I want to know what the difference is between that and having a conversation at that same volume with a friend?

I don't think anybody has a right to quiet in public. You wouldn't tell somebody to shut up on the bus because you don't want to hear their conversation, so what's so different about if I decided to watch a video and didn't have headphones on me?

Now you can say, ""just get some headphones"", but I would counter that with ""if you want quiet in a public space its your responsibility to bring headphones"".

I will also clarify - I don't do this. I lost my headphones recently and can't really afford new ones at the moment, but still I wouldn't do this just because I don't need everybody around me to know how much magic the gathering content I watch. But I see people complaining that somebody was watching a YouTube video at a restaurant or something, and I honestly can't see a difference between watching a video and having an audible conversation.

"CMV: Slavery has been renamed to human trafficking to make people feel better about benefitting from it. Across major global industries, utilities, agriculture, apparel, food, etc, there's a ton of forced labor. Odds are that the device you're reading this on was made with parts or materials produced or mined by slaves. But the more I look into this, the more conspicuous the absence of the terminology of slavery becomes. There's plenty of talk about ""forced labor,"" or ""human trafficking."" Very little ""slavery."" 

When I ask about this, people provide half-baked explanations about human dignity. I call bullshit. I believe that this distinction is made not out of some respect for human dignity but to make consumers feel better about benefitting from forced labor and hellish conditions. If you hear ""human trafficking in the supply chain,""  you think ""oh, that's bad, someone should do something about that."" If you hear ""Your shirt was made by slaves,"" you probably have a much stronger reaction. 

I don't know who did it. When I try to do research, the change is obfuscated. I don't know who's responsible. Maybe manufacturers don’t want buyers to dwell on the exploitation behind their products. Maybe it's consumers who don't want to feel bad for buying slave goods. Maybe it's even the NGOs fighting against it, trying not to come on too strongand alienating the public.

In particular I think about a few discussions I have had exes and people in the past, a convo with my ex regarding the holocaust and they were saying how it was “fine” and when I pressed them on it a little they more or less went on about mass killing isn’t “wrong” since nothing is “right”. I guess I understand the argument, but hearing my pretty liberal gf call the holocaust “fine” kind of changed how I felt about them a bit. Maybe it was wrong of me to try and stiffel their opinion, but it just seemed like they really wanted to get across how ok they were with mass killing in general.

On another occasions they traveled to another city with some roommates for spring beeak and were talking about how theyd left the roommate at a hotel with some guys theyd just met and I said something to the effect of “thats how people get sex traficked, we fought ab it a little and they more or less ended up ultimatetly saying “theres nothing objectively wrong with sec trafficking” which again maybe true in a sense, but that is flimsy justification for leaving your friend with a bunch of strangers

"CMV: The most effective way to moderate American political division is to radically limit immigration for the next 30 to 40 years A common troupe of reddit posts is that we are living in unprecedented times of division and uncertainty. Studying history it is obvious we are not, so many of our strifes are repetitive of the turn of the century. 

But one of the actual unprecedented facts of today is the percentage of foreign born or immigrants relative to the totally population is at its highest ever and is only growing. With the motivation that I find America exceptional and I have a vested interest in it retaining its superpower status I have come to the conclusion that a radical reduction in immigration is the most effective way to moderate our national divisions. I can recognize where my thinking has been influenced by more nationalist rhetoric which is why I am posting for my view to be challenged/changed. 

Definition: to moderate means to reduce division, disunity and discourse without violence. 

Why I think this is necessary

1. American population is currently ~15% foreign born, this is the highest since our founding. Understandably individuals in that group are going to have a shared identity and significant ties to their birth country. This is a direct national security concern, roles in national security require clearances, which by and large require you to be a natural born or naturalized citizen. Foreign contacts make obtaining a security clearance significantly more difficult thus limiting the pool of workers eligible for these roles. Individuals with foreign family are also much more susceptible to foreign entities putting pressure on those families to coerce treason. 

2. Studies have demonstrated that after the 2nd generation immigrant families assimilate and primarily identify with their current nation. This assimilation will establish a “new” American identity.  We dont question “italian-americans” identity because at this point the majority of self identified italian-americans are 3rd generation americans. Change takes time but it will occur. 

3. Reducing immigration and not forcing significant emigration will reduce the “immigrant” boogeyman argument. You can’t make the argument that the immigrants are stealing jobs when there are virtually no immigrants. This allows protections for other workers to form.

"CMV: Women face very few social consequences for being physically aggressive toward men, and men are socially punished at every stage of life if they retaliate. From childhood through adulthood, boys and men are consistently taught “a man should never hit a woman.” This is reinforced literally everywhere by family, neighborhood, school, peers, media, and society.

The inverse is not being taught with anywhere with the same level of reinforcement. The social expectations and consequences are extremely one sided.

In childhood, boys who hit girls are punished more harshly than when girls hit boys. Even when the girl clearly initiated the physical altercation.
Boys are told, “You never hit a girl. Ever.”
Girls are rarely told, “You never hit a boy. Ever.”

In adolescents/teenage years, if a boy retaliates after a girl hits him, there are immediate social punishment from peers. Other boys will step in and mob attack him, regardless of who started things. Then he receives social shaming for his behavior and is labeled abeled as ""abusive,"" coward,"" “a woman beater,"" or ""punk/pussy."" Meanwhile, the girl faces little to no social consequences for initiating the physical aggression.

The same pattern persists into adulthood. If a man physically defends himself against a physically aggressive woman (even lightly) other men will intervene violently against him.

He carries the social stigma for both her behavior and his behavior. She is rarely labeled negatively for attacking him, while he’s will always be condemned for how he responded.

Its a damned if you do, damned if you dont for every stage of life for men. If a male doesn’t retaliate, he’s mocked for “letting a girl beat him up,” being weak, or not standing up for himself.",reddit_changemyview,post,483,2025-11-17 13:34:33,https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ozo9r7/cmv_women_face_very_few_social_consequences_for/,591,386,True,512-1K

The “Karma” system where we lose “points” when our opinion is disliked means that we always seek to obtain everyone’s approval. And obviously when the publications are not unanimous, the authors of the posts delete their publication.

"CMV: Current IVF practices should be illegal, and abortion should be legal IVF involving fertilizing many eggs results in intentionally destroying some. I am the type of pro choice person that believes personhood possibly does begin at conception, but it does not matter because a person should have full rights to medical choices involving their bodily health, even if that choice results in another person not surviving. Therefore, intentionally destroying a fertilized egg outside of a womb should carry the same repercussions as destroying an infant human.

For example, people who have no brain activity sometimes spontaneously become brain-active again. They were a person and never stopped being a person. It’s a slippery slope defining personhood based on brain activity or intelligence, so most people agree that when someone becomes brain dead, they do not necessarily immediately lose personhood. I do not believe in “pulling the plug” unless that person is obviously in a lot of pain and they are located in an area with legal human euthanasia. Similarly, a fetus could be considered a person soon, so it is correct to grant them certain rights (like murder charges for those that intentionally cause miscarriages to pregnant women).

A fetus having certain rights does not mean they should have more rights than the mother, however. We do not force blood or organ donations from parents, unless it is through pregnancy. That is contradicting, and should be amended by making abortion legal in all cases. The only reason abortion should be legal, is because it is wrong to deny a person that choice. Whether their choice is immoral or not is irrelevant, because taking away that choice in the first place would be both horrible morally and is detrimental to the mortality rate of pregnant women.

Please change my view, because I genuinely do feel bad for people that want to have a family but are struggling. It’s highly possible I am personally infertile and would have to use IVF in the future in order to have children. I do understand the struggle, but I cannot justify the destruction of some eggs, just because I wanted to have children. No one is entitled to having children, after all.

"CMV: being anti transplant is xenophobic Right off the bat this is something I intuitively disagree with. But when I think about it, it’s hard to really differentiate the two. 

So first critique of transplants are that they do not *belong* in the community. Some even say they do not have roots in it. This is obviously xenophobic. Saying one group has a right to the land because they were already there is a common retort of conservatives against immigrants. 

Second critique of transplants is that they negatively economically affect the community. Again this is a common xenophobic line: “If X group infiltrated our community, they’ll increase labor competition and decrease our wages.” Commonly this is euphemistic and not real, but even if it was, for many people on the left this would still not be a valid reason to prevent immigration. 

Third critique is that transplants do little for their communities. So this argument differentiates foreign rich people from foreign rich people who just drive costs up without doing any volunteering etc. This seems pretty convincing, but again, I just don’t see it holding up. Does this logic entail that people in the community who just mind their own business should be warded off? This critique might be that “poorer people jn the community are not driving costs up, therefore they don’t have to compensate by other means.” However I don’t see how this doesn’t just run into the problem from point 2. If Japanese Americans owning land in California did make it more economically difficult for already existing white farmers, should they either volunteer for said farmers or leave? I’m not sure this can be a basis. 

4th critique is culture. I just want to return to the first critique in this, with the notion of there being an “authentic culture” that has to be protected from foreign threats being definition ally xenophobic. 

5th critique, and I think the most likely, is just class hatred. Rich people are annoying, and them coming, driving prices up, and expelling people is frustrating. They are a class enemy, and must be fought against. However, I don’t know if this feeling can be justified outside of being a feeling, and how it avoids the previous critiques.",reddit_changemyview,post,0,2025-11-19 09:20:25,https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1p18xau/cmv_being_anti_transplant_is_xenophobic/,549,490,True,512-1K
"CMV: US sports leagues need relegation and promotion. In Europe most sports leagues on the professional level have relegation and promotion. This setup allows for steaks to matter no matter where your team ranks in the league. The top teams at the top League in a country are contenders for a hotly contested title and then get to play in Continental playoffs call champions leagues while teams towards the bottom of their leagues face relegation and being demoted from their current league to the league below this means that every game matters whether you're in the top five trying to get promoted for win the top League or whether you're in the bottom five just trying to hang on steaks are always at play. 

In every American sport the most popular professional League has no relegation and no promotion they often have bloated numbers of teams and it becomes an exhibition around the midpoint of a season fan bases are either hoping their team keeps winning or hopes their team starts losing because unless you're a contender for the playoffs and the championship game the draft system makes it so that you want to rank as low as possible if you're not one of the teams vying for the title. 

Another reason for having relegation and promotion is it allows more people to get involved with the sport in Europe there's thousands of teams that all can theoretically have a chance at making it to the top League you can play in a semi-professional or even casual manner and still have a chance at making big since regional leagues or local leagues still have points and if you do well enough and these local or regional tournaments you might get a spot in the lowest level of the professional pyramid of leagues. 

It keeps people invested in the sport in the United States if you were good in high school you can go to college play for a college team but less than 1% make it to the pros and then while you can still watch and root for your local team the dream ends your personal involvement in the sport you loved since you were a child is over sure you can play for fun and small amateur leagues but playing competitively is finished.

"CMV: China will not overtake the US economy The future economy will be dominated by technology and currently it seems the United States is more advanced than China in almost every major sector.

In Artificial Intelligence, American companies spend far more than China and AI use is much more widespread here, especially within corporations. Additionally, US AI models consistently rank higher than Chinese models, deep seek came close but has been blown out of the water since. In robotics, it’s still even and too early to tell but Boston Dynamics humanoid bots seem the most advanced and there are plenty of robots in operation in the US. While China leads in EVs, the US leads in autonomous vehicles. 

In chip design, America leads with Nvidia, Apple and Qualcomm etc. consistently being rated as some of the most powerful GPUs and CPUs and dominate market share. America also controls most of the software used in design. In consumer electronics, American companies dominate with Dell, HP etc. Windows and MacOS are American owned and there is no Chinese equivalent. As long as Taiwan doesn’t fall the US should be fine. Also in Quantum Computing, there are tons of firms and private investment into it compared to China. Additionally, IBM has demonstrated capability with 1000 qubits, much more than what China has done.

In aerospace, NASA leads in capability and scientific advancements. SpaceX launches 90% of all mass into orbit and twice as many launches per year than China does, at a fraction of the cost due to reusability and thats not even mentioning Starship. Blue Origin also recently landed a booster thats 2 American companies vs 0 Chinese agency. The next space station is also being developed by a private company. Easy access to space can open up plenty of opportunities including asteroid mining.

America has universities that consistently rank as the best in the world, whereas Chinese universities are not known for their prestige and even though some may output a lot of research, that research doesn’t lead to innovation as much as American universities do. A lot of students go to America to study and work for a reason, and due to its openness and higher wages compared to China, a lot of the top talent will choose to go to America. America despite its smaller population size will still have the world’s talent pool to draw from while China will not, immigration to China for studies and work is much lower.

"CMV: 0.9999 repeating being equal to 1 is true mathematically, but not logically I'm hoping this will be a pretty quick CMV because I don't think this will get into the nitty-gritty of math.

Just some background, I got introduced to the concept of 0.9999 repeating being equal to 1 about a week ago.  Being that I'm in my mid-40s, I'm picking this up really late in life.  Fortunately I don't come into this carrying some grudge about a math professor marking me down on this or anything so I feel open minded about the idea, but I also intuitively don't like it.

To at least simplify things, I'm not going to argue that 0.9999 isn't equal to 1 mathematically.  I know as much about advanced math concepts as I do about designing a rocket so don't want to try and argue that.

What I'm interested in is if we remove math from this, can we say pretty safely that even a child would know 0.9999 repeating isn't 1?  Just like if we remove one grain of sand from earth, we don't have the exact same earth as we did before that grain of sand was removed.  Sure that grain of sand didn't matter much, but it did change things.  The very reason that we have something like 0.9999 repeating is for cases like this where we remove a very, very, very small amount, but we did remove something.

I don't care if math needs 0.9999 repeating to equal 1.  That's totally fine with me.  It's a mathematical model that depends on this being the case and breaking that would cause other problems in math.  Sometimes we just need to make these kinds of concessions with extremely complex models likes this.  And this even goes into how the concept of infinity is very bizarre.  Like even infinity isn't infinity when we consider that between 0 and 1 there are infinity numbers but between 0 and 2 there is an even larger infinity of numbers.",reddit_changemyview,post,0,2025-11-19 09:28:53,https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1p194nf/cmv_09999_repeating_being_equal_to_1_is_true/,1308,423,True,1K-2K
"CMV: hostility towards Muslims in East Asia is a reaction to demand for cultural change that are perceived as disruptive to the collective order rather than religious bigotry specific to Islam In three East Asian countries, China, Japan and Korea, they come with different flavors of anti-Islam sentiment and policies that's often decried as Islamophobia. 

However, accusations of Islamophobia from other governments or NGOs often go nowhere because they all see it as disruptive to the collective order rather than unique hostility to Islam or its teachings. 

These are all highly secular / effectively non-religious societies that have their ""way of life"" that's accepted by most, if not all, of its population that a part of moving to their society involves in accepting their ""way of life"" as your own.

  
Let's start with China's state repression. 

For many years, China was accused of cultural genocide of Uigyur population, and the government action, [such as sending children to secular boarding schools away from their parents ](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/28/world/asia/china-xinjiang-children-boarding-schools.html)were justified and largely accepted by the Chinese people under ther esasoning of national security and Sinicizations. 

After all, Hui Muslims and large presence of Halal restaurants in China show that its policies are not hostility towards a specific religion (which is applied to all religions), but a hostility towards state stability, harmonization (Sinicization) and preventing separatism (national unity). 

  
Then we go on to Japan's burial ground disputes.

  
In Japan, 99.9% of deaths result in cremation. It's considered cultural norm given limited burial space and cultural practices. 

Its people have accepted 99.9% cremation rate as a necessity for sanitation and land use efficiency. [As such, local population sees the demand for burial plots as a direct challenge to their customs](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/japan-muslims-burial-cemetery-grounds-hiji-miyagi-cremation-row-13859116.html) and refusal to conform to its national law and tradion: especially in a nation where ""conforming"" means everything.

"CMV: For the sake of parity with video games, there should be a ratings system for home videos A rather unusual feature in anime home videos is that there's a ""rating"". This is no doubt due to the blockbuster video horror stories caused by angry parents renting some violent/perverse anime VHS for their kids because it was animated (thanks animation age ghetto mentality). Contrast with home videos from say the ""big"" companies (i.e. Sony, Disney, Universal, Warner, Paramount), where (not counting their movie releases), virtually all of them don't have a ""rating"". They just go with ""Not Rated"". Why must anime home videos have to ""police"" themselves but releases from the big companies don't? This had lead me to this conclusion that we are at a crossroads of sorts: either we have a centralized rating system for home videos (like an equivalent to the ESRB but for home videos) where home videos get submitted for classification so they can be sold in stores or anime finally grows up and begins phasing out this whole self-ratings practice that they've been doing since the late 90s/early 00s because now they've entered mainstream status and people these days know better of the shows' contents.

Also up north in Canada, this can supersede the Canadian Home Video Rating System, leaving MPA Canada to only focus on rating movies in the theaters. This is much like how the ESRB covers both the US and Canada.

Now for this home video ratings syste, here's what these ratings would be:

* G (color-coded green) - Suitable for viewing by all ages. Ecompasses the G rating and low-end PG.
* PG (color-coded blue) - Parental guidance recommended. Some themes or content may not be suitable for children. Encompasses the PG rating and low-end PG-13.
* 15A (color-coded orange) - Suitable for persons 15 and older. No one younger than 15 may purchase or rent a 15A video unless accompanied by an adult. A person may be asked to show proof of age before purchasing or renting a 15A video. Comparable to high-end PG-13 and low-end R.",reddit_changemyview,post,0,2025-11-19 05:32:03,https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1p145jk/cmv_for_the_sake_of_parity_with_video_games_there/,975,464,True,512-1K
"CMV: Tipping by percentage is completely irrational, and its dumb to shame ""bad tippers"" I have never heard even close to a decent argument for the current method of tipping while eating out in the US, which is by a percentage of your total bill. I dont even know where to begin.

I dont understand how it even came about for someone to think that a waiter deserves more money from you if you order an expensive dish rather than a cheap dish. I could maybe see you tipping the \*cook\* more for making a complicated dish. But if i order white toast and coffee for $5, or if I order the filet for $50, what has the waiter done differently that society has decided he deserves like 7x more money for the second one? (just using rough numbers)

The white toast with butter isnt any harder to remember than a medium rare filet, it any harder to carry over the one plate and drink for both orders, the waiter does the exact same amount of work both times. And yet I would be considered very generous if I tipped $10 for one, and barely doing more than the bare minimum if I tipped $10 for the other. 

  
If we are going to exist in a completely asinine system where restaurants are just allowed to pay their servers less than any other worker is legally allowed to be paid, which I dont know why they allow, the only thing that makes sense is that we decide a flat rate. like the amount of work required to serve a person dinner is like $8 or something, and thats what everyone spends. because I can see how serving a larger table would warrant a larger tip, but again a large table of steaks doesnt warrant a higher tip than a large table of salads. 

So its dumb to shame a person for not tipping the right percentage, because firstly the (i think) generally accepted amount of a 15% tip is a completely arbitrary number, and secondly the arbitrary number is one in a system that makes no sense in the first place. if a waiter is paid ten bucks for carrying one plate to a table I feel like thats pretty damn generous regardless of whats on the plate. 

  
And Im going to close by saying that Im not trying to get out of tipping, I make sure to tip well all the time. I just hate things that dont make any sense.",reddit_changemyview,post,299,2025-11-17 09:04:27,https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ozh4oh/cmv_tipping_by_percentage_is_completely/,522,494,True,512-1K

"CMV: Religion is Obviously Illogical, Which is Why they Ask for Faith Edit: For clarity, this is my logic condensed.

World religions rely on a belief in the supernatural

The supernatural cannot be proven/disproven, which means conclusions drawn from these are  not logical

Using an illogical foundation as a source of morality is also illogical 

Religion is not a reliable source of morality

Full Writeup:
Most of what I will say will reference the Bible because that's what I'm familiar with, but the principle cuts across most religions (abrahamic, meso-american, etc)

Edit: Reworked the paragraph above to acknowledge religions that do not have the same emphasis on a supernatural deity.

Genuinely, if you are religious, why do you believe in God? Have you spoken to God directly and heard him talk back to you like a voice call? Have you seen God in person? ""Most"" of us haven't.

So, what makes one pray to and worship something they can not interact with?

Also, how do you reconcile the many questionable things God did in the Old Testament?

The way I see things:

— Nobody here has spoken to God or heard back from him

— Isn't it odd to assume something exists and then worship it based on that assumption?

Earlier I said God is brutal in the old testament, well yeah:

He allowed Israelites to enslave foreigners but not fellow Israelites 

He killed a man in Genesis for refusing to impregnate his dead brother's wife

He killed the whole planet with a flood (including the children)

He killed an entire city's worth of people in Jericho (also including children), killed all the animals, and stole all the wealth because????

He asked Abraham to kill his son to ""test"" his faith because???

He purposely hardened the heart of Pharoah (it literally says so word for word  in the Bible) and then punished him for refusing to listen. Actually, he punished the whole of Egypt for the crime of Pharoah?

Paying 3-4 years tuition for a degree that doesn’t have great job prospects or income potential just leaves people unnecessarily saddled down with debt. I think universities could easily scrap lower division courses that are essentially regurgitated high school material or axe the GE requirements. I think GEs are terrible, and force you to take classes on subjects you don’t care about, or just find the class that gives the easiest A.

"CMV: it is morally wrong that atheists donate far less to charity than religious people do, if those atheists converted, they would donate more to charity. Religion isn’t perfect. We’ve all read Israeli twitter and seen the horrific language used to dehumanise Palestinians. Without religion that doesn’t happen. Similarly, of course religion can cause policies to be adopted by states that don’t really make logical or evidential sense. Of course, I concede that some interpretations of faith relating to lgbt issues is harmful. There are other harms associated with faith to. I concede all of that. None of that is what this post is about, and raising these issues is off topic. 

This post is only about one positive metric from religion that I’ve highlighted, and trying to test why atheists do not behave similarly. Attacking religion is intellectually boring. Trying to figure out what atheists can do to mirror its positive aspects is worthy of praise. 

Anyway. My argument is this: the data on the amount donated by religious people to charity, to help strangers they don’t know, is staggering. Atheists donate far less. This is Emperical fact. 

We can speculate what the reasons for this might be:
- religious people believe everyone is made in the image of god and worthy of love. That means their circle of moral concern extends larger, not just to their family or community, but beyond that, to every soul that ever lived. In secular society, a stranger is an other. 
- every day in private and every week in church or at mosque, religious believers reflect on their obligations to others. That’s a moment where their moral compass is reinforced and reset, away from individualism and towards selfless goals. In secular society there really isn’t an equivalent.
- within religious communities there is status associated with giving to charity. Outside of well documented mega churches, and Pentecostal churches, and extravagant synagogues etc which are very much not the global norm. More status can be acquired from building a hospital or school than living in a mansion. Indeed, extravagant displays of wealth are seen as sinful. If you look at secular society today: wealth is seen as an intrinsic good.

"CMV: Muhammad was a false prophet According to the Qur'an's own rules, Muhammad was allied with Satan. The Qur'an unequivocally states that Satan can ONLY exert authority over those allied with him.
“Indeed, there is for him NO AUTHORITY over those who have believed and rely upon their Lord. His authority is ONLY over those who take him as an ally and those who through him associate others with Allah.” (Qur’an 16:98-100)
Yet, the Islamic source texts identify instances in which Muhammad was influenced and even controlled by Satanic forces.

(1) Muhammad received the Qur'an in the same sound as a Satanic instrument:
“the BELL is the musical instrument of the Satan.” (https://sunnah.com/muslim:2114)
And Yet ""How does the divine inspiration come to you?"" He replied, ""… The Angel sometimes comes to me with a voice which resembles the sound of a RINGING BELL” (https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3215)

2) Muhammad's perception and will were mastered by BLACK MAGIC delusions
“Magic was worked on Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) so that he used to think that he had SEXUAL RELATIONS with his wives while he actually had not” (https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5765).
According to Al-Suhayli, a commentator on the Sirah of Ibn Hisham, Muhammad was in this bewitched state and having false sex with his wives for an entire year. (Ibn Ishaq, Sirat Rasul Allah (The Life of Muhammad), A. Guillaume, p. 240). But the same Muhammad is the person Muslims want to take the Qur'an from... 

(3) According to the Qur'an, Muhammad spoke the words of Satan on at least one occasion
""And We DID NOT send before you any messenger or prophet EXCEPT that when he spoke [or recited], Satan threw into it [some misunderstanding]. But Allah abolishes that which Satan throws in; then Allah makes precise His verses."" (Qur'an 22:53)

"CMV: Calling for the boycott of AI for ethical/sustainable reasons is exacerbating polarisation in an already tense political climate and ultimately will do more bad than good I will preface this by acknowledging that I might be living in my own internet bubble and the takes I’ve seen might reveal themselves to not be significant enough to make any difference. 

I’m seeing an increasing amount of left-leaning people calling for the boycott of AI or at least pushing the narrative that using AI is problematic because of ethical and sustainable reasons. 

I’m genuinely concerned by this situation. It’s extremely clear that AI will **not** disappear. And just like for carbon emissions in general, the impact of a few citizens is really marginal compared to those of businesses. It’s genuinely everywhere and is clearly a major technology revolution, just like so many we had before. Advocating for boycott won’t lead us anywhere, what we’ll need is regulations and rules. 

But beyond this, the issue that I see in creating this very negative narrative around AI is that it creates a disparity between people, but:
- We’re already so polarised and divided at the moment, this is fuelling additional tensions and anger politically. Now we’re adding another filter for separation with people who are okay or not okay with using AI - it’s a dangerous game.

"CMV: Some peoples or cultures are, somehow, just superior to me in ability This topic has been on my mind now for a while as a young North American. I'm an Aerospace Engineer working in a Rocketry program, and of ancestral South Asian (Pakistani) descent. I've been wondering what it is about me or my culture that prevents me from being as successful and accomplished in my field as others my age who are Swedish. Do they just have some innate superiority over me?

Academically, I'm decently accomplished relative to most people I know my age—I was a top student in my university, went to a top school, have a Masters in a very specialized area of Aeronautics, work at one of America's premier Aerospace contractors etc, and I know there are others who share my background who've done the same. This is, I would postulate, to some extent a result of the stereotypical ""Asian parent"" ethos that was instilled in me and people of my background from a young age (Work extremely hard, hyper-meritocratic cultural norms, parents pushing me to pursue excellence in academics/your productive passions) that allowed me to find the level of success that I did in this field of my choice here in America. 

However, I've had this nagging that I haven't done enough when I look at countries like Sweden.. and I just don't know what it is that I'm missing that allows them to have accomplished more in their country than people of my background both in America or my ancestral country. Let me explain further:

Recently I've been working a lot with Swedish contractors to install some very specialized and advanced manufacturing equipment that I'll be taking ownership of to be used in our program. This kind of technology is only made in Sweden (and, I guess, China) despite Sweden being a country of 8 million people. That entire country is literally less people than the current metropolitan area I live in, yet out of the entire world, only Sweden was able to make this technology. 

To further illustrate my case—I'm writing this while listening to my favourite English-speaking Swedish band on Spotify, Spotify by the way also being a Swedish company, while sitting in my bedroom which consists of a lot of IKEA furniture, wearing a shirt by H&M, another Swedish brand.",reddit_changemyview,post,0,2025-11-18 22:22:09,https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1p0wpa4/cmv_some_peoples_or_cultures_are_somehow_just/,1040,483,True,1K-2K
"CMV: Vaccines have been able to completely eradicate infectious diseases, but other procedures have not. It is not a fair comparison to say ""If we can force a child to get a vaccine then we can force a child to..."" Vaccines are so effective that when their is an outbreak amongst children it is almost always traced to an unvaccinated child. To be honest, many of you are still alive because of vaccines. But since vaccines have become a hot topic, people want to try to use it as gotcha moment. 

For example, imagine someone wanting to cut off one of their baby's toes to reduce the chance of them getting a foot fungus and it's ok because we force children to get vaccines and they wouldn't remove all the toes so their feet will still be normal. On the surface it seems like a decent idea, but ultimately it's not a logical conclusion. We have entire nations of people with toes and a foot fungus is not a national health crisis, and we have medicines to treat a foot fungus. Therefore we would agree to give our children vaccines but wouldn't cut off one of their toes.

"CMV: consciousness seems like it could be explained by scientists relatively easily please tell me if i'm just stating the obvious but here we go



my idea of consciousness is that it is comparable to the instincts animals feel but amplified basically, like an animal knows intrinsically when it is hungry- it doesn't have the language to express it but it obviously knows, as it will go to get food. humans feel many of the same innate feelings, such as hunger again, and then translate them into words (in their minds or out loud) and act on them. emotions come into it too of course, but those aren't exclusive to humans, as many animals exhibit territorial behaviors, jealousy, etc. I think that consciousness is just the combined effect of very many of these impulses (insticts+emotional+more maybe?), plus language. even language isn't fully unique to us though, and I don't know loads about the science behind it, but many animals have calls that act as a rudimentary language, I think i've even heard of animals having names (might just be paddington that told me that..). the difficult part of consciousness might fall in the linking of stimulus to comprehension to language, but I think even plants exhibit this to an extent (minus the language), they have responses to light, gravity etc, so they ""learn"" from the stimulus and adapt their behaviour for survival. same kind of goes for our spinal cords. the language part is harder, but I think that's part of the 'response' to stimulus, like, you see a friend and have learned from experience to wave and say hi. can you really differentiate these?

  
basically I think humans just happen to have particularly sophisticated brains compared to other animals, not unlike the fact that some animals will have more sophisticated body parts than humans (better muscle development, echolocation etc..) so even the brains thing doesnt really differentiate us, as that's just our USP, everything has it's own. I'm not even a big fan of most animals but I think we differentiate ourselves from them too much.

  
so I don't know a lot and I dont know if consciousness even exists, but whatever it is, I dont think that it's some inextricable, magical force seen in humans alone, I think we exist on a consciousness spectrum with all other species.",reddit_changemyview,post,0,2025-11-18 19:05:49,https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1p0sfn3/cmv_consciousness_seems_like_it_could_be/,588,483,True,512-1K

In public it’s always about how taxation stifles growth or that the government is more corrupt than private business or that “a rising tide lifts all boats so inequality does matter at all” (Ignoring that money equals political power and the more unequal a society is the more political power is concentrated in a small elite of oligarchs); while in private they talk about the common worker almost as if they are a different species, how they are smarter than the ignorant masses and should lead because of that, they all know the horrors of their economic policies in the gilded age but just don’t care and see it as the rightful and natural order.

I say this because I've seen many people claiming that withput Trump the Republican party will collapse and I don't think this is true. Admittedly, partly because of Trump, the inequality, unfairness, and ruthlessness of American society hasn't gotten better. The racism, xenophobia, and bigotry only seem to deepen. The inability, stagnation, and bloat of government remains. 

These things are what got Trump elected, what enshrine Republican politics in the highest offices of the land, they're the wave he's riding to line his and his friends' pockets. If they continue it's almost certain, now that the winning strategy is laid, that another Trump or fascism itself may rise again in the future. Even if the Republican party collapses the politics and ideology that fuels it will just transform into another political party to vie for power. 

I feel we invest Trump with importance that he's stolen from the things that really deeply matter. This isn't to say we shouldn't oppose him or be truly frightened of whatever he's going to do next. He's incredibly powerful. But we shouldn't get lost while doing that and shouldn't delude ourselves that this fight has existed and will continue exist irrespective of Trumps presence.

"CMV: Becoming a household-name artist in the 2000s and the early 2010s was easier than it is now. Singers in the 2000s had a big advantage because becoming famous back then was much easier than it is today. When a singer appeared on TV, nearly everyone saw their songs and music videos, since the number of channels was limited.  
Now, with the internet, millions of aspiring singers who release their songs online appear for listeners, and their visibility is restricted by algorithms. With the decline of TV, the huge number of channels, and the way online algorithms work, becoming famous has become much harder.  
With the rise of music platforms like YouTube, TikTok, and Spotify which tend to use more aggressive algorithms today than in previous years  everything has changed. It’s now much harder for anyone to become a household-name singer the way 2000s artists did. And today, singers from Africa, Asia, and the Middle East compete with global superstars with giant marketing like Taylor Swift and Beyoncé instead of only competing with local artists from their own regions and this made local music less popular in their regions.",reddit_changemyview,post,17,2025-11-17 09:15:44,https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ozhe5v/cmv_becoming_a_householdname_artist_in_the_2000s/,235,235,False,128-256

"CMV: Britain is not “full” There was a recent debate between the Green Party leader and a Reform UK councillor about immigration and asylum seekers. The comments section were filled with an abundance of “rahh Britain is full! It’ll destroy the countryside!!!” that kind of just makes me eye roll.


I would not describe the UK as being too full at all. By contrary, we actually have a decreasing population and a decrease in foreign immigrants compared to a decade ago. Britains problem isn’t that it’s too full of people, it’s that its infrastructure is absolute garbage and many postcodes up and down the country have fallen to derelict and decay under austerity, forcing populations to congest in places like London, Manchester or Birmingham.


There’s a push for a second new towns act of sorts that aims to create modern, efficient and desirable places aimed at young professionals. I think this is a good step, but what would be even better is if large chunks of towns and suburbs in the country that already exist were renovated and modernised. There are communities in the rural North, Welsh Valleys and even southern counties like Essex and Somerset which are extremely rural, poor and a shadow of their former selves. If these places were transformed into modern, urban centres with healthy job markets and good amenities millions would pour out of the big cities due to the affordability of it all.


Of course, any plan to do anything like this in the country is smacked down by ignorant boomers and reactionaries with a notion of being destructive to the environment. “Not in my back garden!!! It’ll be loud and polluting and congested!!!”. Not only are these takes misinformed, they’re actually damaging to the cause they feel strongly to. If you don’t want Britain to be overpopulated, why are you against new urban centres that can distribute people more evenly across the country and away from bustling city centres? 


There is also the immigration aspect, which is a debate in it of itself. I believe Labour’s treatment of migrants has been appalling and I have no idea why Starmer has decided to do this. I will preface by saying that I don’t think illegal immigration is a good thing but I also do not think treating migrants (illegal or otherwise) like this is remotely okay.

"CMV: Every explanation I've heard saying the Monty Hall Problem isn't a 50/50 chance makes zero sense. 3 doors, 1 door has money, 2 doors have a goat.

You pick one door, but can't open it yet. The gameshow host picks a door that has a goat behind it. Do you switch?

It's not a question that can be answered with complete certainty, because you don't have enough information. 

Your odds go from 1/3 to 1/2. 3 Doors with unknown contents -> 2 doors with unknown contents, and a door that you'll never pick because you can clearly see the goat behind it.

Now for the 100+ doors explanation. 
You have 100+ doors. You pick one. The host opens all doors except yours and one other door.
So the door they left must be the right one, right? I mean, you've just eliminated all but one of the other doors, and the chance you picked the right one is so small...

I've seen people try to use this as proof that, because it's such a small chance you'll pick the right door, the one door the host leaves HAS to be the right one, right?

Except...

Your chances haven't changed at all. You have no information, just like before.
You still have a set of unopened doors and no clue what's behind any of them.

Sure, if there were 100 doors then your chance of picking the right one is 1/100... but your first choice isn't your final answer. The first choice is completely meaningless, because the only choice that matters is between 2 doors only.

So a 50% chance.

"CMV: C++ should have adopted destructive move semantics instead of nondestructive move semantics. Destructive move is radically nicer because it allows for nice types like a nonnullable version of unique\_pointer. (Rust calls this Box). It does this by a) not calling destructors of moved-from objects and b) statically prohibiting moved-from variables from being accessed.

The [primary paper](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2002/n1377.htm#Alternative%20move%20designs) arguing for move semantics in C++ made two primary arguments against destructive move, but they don't seem well thought out. It's completely possible that, now that we have the benefit of hindsight, someone could make a more convincing argument, but I haven't seen it.

First:

>When dealing with class hierarchies, destructive move semantics becomes problematic. If you move the base first, then the source has a constructed derived part and a destructed base part. If you move the derived part first then the target has a constructed derived part and a not-yet-constructed base part. Neither option seems viable. Several solutions to this dilemma have been explored.

The solution here seems pretty simple. Move the base first and make it a compile-time error for a move constructor of a type with a superclass to do anything with the source pointer other than access data members that are not part of the superclass.  For example, given

    class A{
        public:
        sting x;
    };
    class B:A{
        string y;
        string z;
    };

if we were to add move constructors to A and B, B's move constructor wouldn't be able to do anything to the source except to source->y and source->z. 

Second:

>One can not destructively move an auto object, nor a static object.

It's not clear to me why you would want to destructively move a static object. Rust wasn't prior art at the time this sentence was written, but its drop-flags design seems pretty obvious, and allows auto objects to be destructively moved.",reddit_changemyview,post,70,2025-11-16 16:03:29,https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1oyx402/cmv_c_should_have_adopted_destructive_move/,506,506,False,384-512

"CMV: AI in music (like the song I Run by Haven) is not bad I've seen an increasing number of people say they won't listen to songs such as I Run strictly because it has AI Vocals, which I think is not a good reason to dislike a song. I am someone who does not like a lot of songs for various reasons, but simply using AI as the reason makes no sense to me. These are the following reasons I've found for people against it.

1) AI is bad for the environment and is a waste of resources for music

Since when was music a way to gauge what is good and not for the environment? So many different things are bad for the environment, including concerts, but that isn't a reason to dislike music. People don't dislike flying, driving, using batteries, or any other environmentally unfriendly things. Does AI harm the environment? 100% yes, but we live in a world where that is just the nature of everything. We should find ways to make AI less intensive, more green, and invest in nuclear energy, which would do a lot more for the world than not listening to a song that uses AI just to make it. (I also think the carbon footprint of streaming songs millions of times greatly outweighs the energy used to use AI to make 1 song, but that is an assumption.)

2) Using AI in music makes the music soulless

Yes, music is a medium in which artists can express themselves, their views, and create political discussion. It has always been a way to bring people together through using good beats, vocals, etc. To me, using AI is just a different way for an artist to express themselves. In the case of I Run, the producer made the beat, lyrics, and everything except recording the vocals. That seems like a song that is mirroring the artist's intent, and if anything, is 100% the artist's vision. I personally couldn't even tell it was AI until others pointed it out, which makes me wonder, how can people tell what the soul in a song even is? Is it the emotion of the voice, is it how the beat makes you feel, or is it something else completely?

3) Using AI takes away real artists' jobs

I don't fully agree with this take either. People who love creating music will create music.",reddit_changemyview,post,0,2025-11-17 23:19:53,https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1p02eyz/cmv_ai_in_music_like_the_song_i_run_by_haven_is/,695,490,True,512-1K
"CMV: Choose or choose not, you will regret both. I believe that no matter what we do in life, there will always be some form of regret connected to the path we take and the path we do not take. Making a choice can bring growth, joy, success, pain, or failure, but it also means closing the door on other possibilities that might have led to different outcomes. On the other hand, avoiding or delaying a choice can feel safe in the short term, but often leads to regret later, because opportunities pass and cannot be revisited.

My view comes from reflecting on my own decisions as well as the ones I avoided or postponed. Even when I made choices that turned out well, there have still been moments where I wondered what could have happened if I had chosen differently. When I avoided choices, I sometimes felt protected at first, but eventually regretted not trying. For this reason, I do not believe there is a way to go through life without regret. I do not think life is about winning or reaching an ideal outcome, but rather finding peace with the cost of whatever we do or do not do.

What might change my view:
	1.	Arguments or examples showing that it is possible to live without regret in a realistic and lasting way
	2.	A perspective that shows how regret can be eliminated rather than accepted or managed
	3.	A different way of thinking about choice that removes the weight of lost possibilities

"CMV: wearing headphones/earbuds/earplugs while driving should be legal. I believe this is an unpopular opinion, please hear me out (pun intended). In my state, it is illegal to wear headphones while driving because they reduce one's ability to hear horns, sirens, etc. I believe this reasoning is shallow and misguided.

Here are my main arguments why drivers wearing headphones should not be illegal:

1. **Hearing impaired people drive just fine.** It's not illegal for hearing impaired folks to get behind the wheel, and there is no clear evidence that they are more likely to be involved in accidents. They adapt with mirrors and visual cues. If total silence isn't a dealbreaker for them, why is partial sound dampening illegal for the rest of us?
2. **Cars are designed to be highly sound insulated anyway.** Automotive engineers are constantly making vehicles quieter with better sound insulation and even active noise cancellation in high end models. There is no legal limit on how silent a car can be on the inside, so why draw the line at headphones? Perhaps someday, if soundproofing advances to a certain point, a law will be introduced that requires some level of sound to pass through the car. We're not there yet in terms of sound insulation or noise canceling headphones. The best noise cancelling headphones still let in plenty of ambient sounds, especially horns and sirens. In my loud car with noise canceling headphones, I can still hear more road noise than in my friends' modern cars without headphones. This feels like discrimination against owners of old cars.
3. **Blasting music through speakers is totally fine, apparently.** I've ridden with people who crank their stereo so loud, they can't hear outside noises, and that's legal. But if I listen to soft breathing exercises through my headphones at a low volume, suddenly I'm a reckless criminal?
4. **Misophonia.** I have severe sound sensitivity. I am part of the earmuff community. I wear earplugs and/or headphones (yes, often both) pretty much all day. I would not be able to function otherwise. Many sounds cause a visceral, nails on a chalk board type response in my body. Road noise is no exception.

I understand that there is no ethical consumption under capitalism, but maybe it’s because wealth hoarders like him, who claim to be benefiting humanity by hoarding wealth away to “grow it to help future people” while people starve now. While people die now. It’s pathological. They just need to make more money and even their funds are ways of doing it and hiding the fact from the public and irs. 

He could divest of companies that have committed atrocious crimes or lies. He does not. He chooses to continue to pay companies that hurt people money in order for them to definitely hurt more people and rob from the same future he purports to be giving his wealth to, to maybe make more money. Seems like a bad deal for the rest of us.

"CMV: the most dangerous criminals should be able to choose between life sentence and death sentence. Now I'm talking about convicted criminal that did the most terrible crimes (so like cerial killers and the like) in which rehabilitation attempts have failed and it is too dangerous to let them out. There is a lot of discourse on whether it would be better and more humane to have them send their whole life in prison or be sentenced to death. But I think the best course of action for these people is to let them choose.

If they choose to serve a life sentence, they would potentially be able to be relised only if they are found innocent. I also don't think that solitary confinement should be used for prison sentences, expesually for long periods of time. 

If they choose the death sentence, their execution would be carried out shortly after being put on death row. Prisoners on death row often have to wait years or even decades in isolation which I think is very inhumane. So if a convicted murderer knows they will not eventually be found innocent and would rather die than being locked up for the rest of their lives, they can choose capital punishment. In 2 weeks of their choice they will be put to death by method of their choice. 

Either way the inmates would be allowed to change their sentence to the other at any time (except for 48 hours leading up to execution and within 48 hours of sentence being chosen or switched.)

If anyone can come up with a better system that could change my mind.",reddit_changemyview,post,0,2025-11-17 15:20:59,https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ozr60r/cmv_the_most_dangerous_criminals_should_be_able/,312,312,False,256-384
"CMV: Male virgins are not unattractive because they’re virgins. They’re unattractive because they always bring it up. Women don’t care about a man’s past the way that a lot of men care about a woman’s. In my years of dating, I don’t recall a woman ever asking about my history. In most cases, a woman isn’t even going to know that a guy is a virgin UNLESS he volunteers that information. And that’s the mistake. 

The moment a man brings up the fact that he’s a virgin, the vibe changes. Now, she’s wondering if you’re talking to her exclusively in hopes of losing the V-card. Personally, I think that bringing up sex at all should be up to the woman. A little suggestive flirting is fine, but that bridge should not be crossed until SHE is comfortable with going there. At no point is there a reason to mention that you’re a virgin. 99% of the time, she is not even going to ask. 

The early stages of dating are all about finding out if there is chemistry. If the chemistry is there, and intimacy is on the table, most women aren’t going to care about your experience or lack of. When guys bring up sex…even if they’re bringing up the fact that they’ve never done it, it sends a message that sex is all you care about, and things can go from great to ghosted really fast…

"CMV: Your partner going to the club without you is a red flag I came across a certain genre of relationship posts on Reddit, asking if they should let their partner go to the club without them. Many people focused on the choice of language rather than the root concern. Many responses mentioned how you can’t “let or not let” your partner go to the club. They say this is a controlling attitude. I think the real question that is being asked, and should be contemplated is if they have a right to be concerned.

I think you have a right to be concerned if your partner goes to the club without you. Clubs are public, social spaces, where a lot of people go to find sexual partners. Is that necessarily the objective of going to a club? Possibly not, but that is a very common association. Personally, I don’t see much purpose going to a club if you’re not trying to meet new people. Some people say they just go clubbing to hang out and dance with their friends. I guess you can go to club with that intention, but you could also just go to your friend’s house, drink, and dance there. Why not do that instead?

Some people have made the argument that you either trust or don’t trust your partner. “If you trust them, you have nothing to worry about. If you don’t trust them, break up with them.” I think this is a very simplistic view of human nature. Everyone is capable of telling the truth, or lying, loyalty or betrayal with every decision you make. You are always capable of making good or bad decisions. Unconditional trust seems irresponsible and delusional. There are always conditions. If you found out your partner spent the night out with someone else, but they promised they didn’t do anything, why should you trust them? Are you gonna be like, “They haven’t given me a reason on mot to trust them so far?” In my opinion, that would be ridiculous. That being said, this is an extreme situation relative to going clubbing.

For full disclosure, I’ve never been to a club myself. I’ve known people who have been to a club and haven’t done anything sexual, but I just think that was a waste of time.",reddit_changemyview,post,0,2025-11-17 15:32:07,https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ozrgt1/cmv_your_partner_going_to_the_club_without_you_is/,551,491,True,512-1K
"CMV: Joe Biden was the best president of my generation (Gen Z), but will sadly be remembered in history for allowing Trump to return. I am a member of Gen Z (1998), and looking back at the presidents who have served during my lifetime, I genuinely think Joe Biden has been the most effective and impactful president of my generation. In terms of his legislative accomplishments, he is really in a league of his own. Also, considering what he inherited from the Trump admin (COVID-19, civil unrest, economic recessesion, etc.), he did a great job in getting the country back on its feet. At the same time, I believe he will ultimately be remembered less for what he accomplished and more for the fact that Donald Trump returned to the presidency afterward.

Below are the plethora of reasons on why I believe Biden is the best president of my generation:

* American Rescue Plan: A large COVID-19 relief package that included direct payments, child tax credit expansion, and funding for schools and local governments.
* Bipartisan Infrastructure Law: Significant federal investment in roads, bridges, broadband, transit, EV charging, and water systems.
* CHIPS and Science Act: Aimed at boosting domestic semiconductor manufacturing and technological competitiveness.
* Inflation Reduction Act: Major climate investment, incentives for clean energy, Medicare drug price negotiations, and ACA subsidy extensions.
* PACT Act\*\*:\*\* Expanded health care and benefits for veterans exposed to toxic burn pits.
* Bipartisan gun safety legislation\*\*:\*\* The first significant federal gun reform in decades.
* Oversaw job growth following the pandemic recession.
* Historically low unemployment rates for extended periods.
* Record small-business creation numbers.
* Manufacturing expansion bolstered by federal investment incentives.
* More federal judges confirmed in the first half of his term than most recent presidents.
* Diverse judicial appointments.
* Executive actions on student loan relief (including targeted forgiveness after the Supreme Court ruling).
* Strengthened alliances abroad (NATO expansion, coordinated response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine).

Despite major legislative wins, the administration struggled to communicate its accomplishments in a way that resonated with the public. Many Americans either didn’t know what was passed or didn’t feel it in their daily lives, which contributed to persistently low approval ratings.",reddit_changemyview,post,0,2025-11-17 16:32:42,https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ozt2vm/cmv_joe_biden_was_the_best_president_of_my/,758,501,True,512-1K
"CMV: 9-5 is perfectly reasonable and gives you plenty of free time I often see people on Reddit complaining that the 9-5 work schedule leaves you with no free time and is too much work to manage

So far in my adult life, I’ve worked in jobs with longer hours, think more 9-8 or even 9-9. If I could log off at 5 PM every day, I feel like I would have all the time in the world to pursue interests. A 9-5 sounds like a dream life to me

For all the people who say the 9-5 gives you no free time, I just don’t understand where all the extra hours go. Let’s say you have a 30 minute commute. Logging off at 5 means you’re home at 5:30. If you want 9 hours of sleep, you likely need to be in bed by 11. That leaves 5.5 hours of free time every day. To me, this is more than enough time to cook dinner, go to the gym, see your friends, spend time with your kids, or do any other activity/hobby you want. 

I understand that there are probably edge cases like folks with 1.5 hour+ commutes where the commute drains your free time, but outside of that, as someone whose job often has them working until 8 PM or even later, I just struggle to see how the 9-5 isn’t a completely reasonable workday that still leaves you with plenty of time to pursue interests outside of work

Then you have the fact that they are generally working in the interests of the state rather than the people. Stop and frisk laws, detainment, search and seizure.

"CMV: Representative democracy is an utterly failed system of governance and will remain so until we figure out how to remove money from the equation. The reason why I have come to adopt such a disillusioned view of the system is because I no longer view it as a system that worked despite it's flaws but rather a concept that has been degraded beyond recognition and no longer even does what it says on the tin anymore. And maybe it was like that earlier too and I was ignorant of it but it has definitely gotten worse and has never been as bad as it is now. 

I regularly see people both online and in my real life express bafflement as to why elected officials so often seem adversarial to the people's wishes which they are supposed to be representing and to that I want to say that this is exactly how this system is supposed to work in current form, the elected officials are not in your service, they are in service of their donors. There is no thought of any consequences either  because even if they stick their neck out a bit too much as long as they are a good lapdog to their corporate masters they can always just get out and get a cushy consultant job or sit on the board of some corporation if they are someone who is high enough in the pecking order.

"CMV: If you are not your partner's best sexual partner, the relationship should either end or open up And this is coming from someone who practices monogamy. Personally, I feel as though that if you are in a relationship and fully aware that there are others that have brought more sexual satisfaction to them, it is wrong to coerce them into staying sexually constrained to just you.

From what I've gathered on Reddit, sexual compatibility is extremely important, and that getting sexual needs met is one of the most important facets within a relationship. Because of this, I believe it is wrong to actively prevent your partner from getting their sexual needs met in ways you cannot achieve. I believe at the end of the day, it is purely ego and insecurity which drives people to prevent their partners from having their sexual needs met.

Of course I would also say that the better alternative is to end the relationship. If you truly care about someone, and are not selfish, you would want them to have the best life possible, and this would mean allowing them to have their sexual needs met. 

In other words, if you know you aren't their best, don't force them to settle. I think it's selfish to force someone you supposedly care about to live a worse life just to pad your own ego and insecurities.",reddit_changemyview,post,0,2025-11-17 19:07:08,https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ozwxlo/cmv_if_you_are_not_your_partners_best_sexual/,270,270,False,256-384
"CMV: Irreverent and 'edgy' comedy is an important part of Western society. Here's my argument for y'all to pick apart and find the holes in:

Back in the day, jesters would perform in royal courts, openly ridiculing kings, queens, princes, lords etc directly to their faces. I'm sure more than once they ended up with their heads chopped off, but non-the-less, just the basic concept gave humour a privileged position in 'speaking truth to power'.

I can't speak for cultures outside my own (British - or more broadly Western), but I believe comedy still performs a similar function today. 

Ideologies, power structures, egoes, political policies are all things that people take so seriously it often leads to violence. This is despite the fact any even any amatuer philosopher would be able to tell you, if you scratch beneath the surface of these concepts you realise how flimsy their foundations are. 

Conservatism, liberalism, MAGA, wokeness, Islam, Christianity, atheism. Many become irate at even the mention of some of these structures. Either because they are so passionately in favour, or so repulsed by them.

Much of the best humour treats all of these positions with equal disrespect. And this is important, for societies to function, we need an understanding that in the context of a joke we can (as comedian Al Murray used to say) 'play' with language, free from consequences.

It means that even within a political system or leaning a good comic - or even just a funny mate at the pub - can rhetirically rip this to shreds. Expose the contradictions,  hypocrisies, reductio ad absurdums, behind any world view.

A prime example was a comic I saw in a local venue who absolutely ripped some of the political positions I hold. I thought it was absolutely on point, hilarious,and held up a mirror to some of the flaws in the socialist ideas I still believe in. It didn't change my view on things like inequality and wealth distribution, but it reminded me in a light-hearted way, that my worldview is far from perfect. 

It's probably why we are so more at ease and warm to people who can openly laugh at themselves. And wary of people who cannot.",reddit_changemyview,post,3,2025-11-16 12:08:50,https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1oyr35p/cmv_irreverent_and_edgy_comedy_is_an_important/,591,488,True,512-1K
"cmv: if you’re a woman and circumcise your child you don’t get to advocate for “My body my choice” Say it with me folks: ELECTIVE Circumcising a child is NON-CONSENTUAL GENITAL MUTILATION. Circumcisions offer marginal upsides for a myriad of lifelong complications. Its a barbaric practice with religious roots that serves no purpose in civilized society. Its no different then in african cultures where they practice FGM where they chop womens’ clits off its 2 sides of the same coin. Many men dont even realize how ineffective their penis is compared to if they had a foreskin. We male humans evolved over time to have foreskins for a reaaon. Without the foreskin the glans (the tip of the penis) undergoes a process called keratanazation which hardens the skin up due to it being exposes to textiles and the elements and signifigantly reduces the sensitivty of the glans. Thousands of various different nerve endings are also severed during this process when the foreskin is taken off. It also helps the penis during sex to have a “sleeve” to slide in and out of during penetration.

You can’t advocate for your right to an abortion andals take away your childs right to have a foreskin and experience sex the way it was supposed to be; if you do you are nothing but a blatant hypocrite.

"CMV: The Trump Clinton thing is probably nothing Ive seen a lot of memes and discussion about epstein's email with his brother where he ""claims"" that Putin may have pictures of donald trump sucking off Bill Clinton.

To be honest, I feel like reading the email chain it was obvious that it was a joke. Jeffrey tells Mark Epstein that he is with Steve Bannon, Mark jokingly says like ""oh ask him about the pictures of Donald Trump sucking off Bill Clinton haha"", the same way a teenager might pretend to moan when their friend is calling their parents.

I dont know whether people online are actually taking it face value, and maybe there is that aspect of it that ive just missed completely, but ive definitely seen people online take this as fact so im a little concerned whether im reading this wrong.

Obviously memes and jokes about it is fine. They're going to be funny for a while, and obviously its funny to think of Donald Trump sucking off Bill Clinton. And this is not to say that Clinton and Trump are not pedophiles who are implicated in Epstein's crimes, but i think i am almost certain that Bill Clinton was not sucked off by Trump.

"CMV: We must accept that Israel’s actions throughout history have, on some level, an inherent tie to Judaism it’s self. Just want to start this off by saying, it is quite clearly NOT all Jews, it’s not even Judaism in general. I’m not an antisemite, and I really hope this doesn’t come across like I’m laying the groundwork for arguments that fall in the realm of blaming Jews in general. Very important distinction I want to make. 

But look. It’s obvious that the root cause for Israel’s historic disregard for basic human decency is that it’s a state that runs on Zionist values. We all know this by now and it’s not controversial to be anti Zionist. That’s what this post is about really, the relationship between Zionism and Judaism. 

Now another important thing I want to make abundantly clear, I know Zionism it’s self is not tied to Judaism, so many Jews around the world and in Israel it’s self are staunchly anti Zionist. I want to try and maintain this tone throughout the post because it’s a delicate topic to navigate.

But the relationship Zionism and Judaism share cannot be ignored. Zionism is a political ideology built entirely upon the Jewish Identity. Zionism it’s self has many different branches but as far as I’m aware, there’s 2 main camps, secular zionists and religious zionists. Secular Zionism doesn’t really believe in incorporating Jewish law with state identity, but religious Zionism does, and religious Zionism is what we see in the current state of Israel. They see the state of Israel as a divine plan, their religious duty in a way to guarantee/secure its endeavours and the whole state of Israel as a step towards messianic redemption. 

The issue here is that they believe settling the biblical land is their religious duty, so any peace plan ever is doomed to fail because the West Bank is considered their biblical heartland. And they believe in combining Jewish law into their national identity, politics and governmental decisions (eg like war with their neighbours). The thing is here, swap the religion to Islam and look at the military action they have undertaken, and it would look like a genuine terror state.",reddit_changemyview,post,0,2025-11-17 14:11:33,https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ozpaln/cmv_we_must_accept_that_israels_actions/,2309,485,True,2K+
"CMV: ""Born in the wrong generation"" can be a completely valid feeling and statement Before I proceed to lay out my arguments, I have to say that I somewhat agree with the criticism towards it, as most of the reasoning tends to be shallow (I like the 90s and Nirvana, everything else sucks and no one gets me now).

However, it can cover a broader view of how one's life has gone in general, their upbringing and core memories. For example, the current socioeconomic trend is for people to move to big cities, as industries get automated and the general idea of a successful life (when it comes to work) is a comfy white-collar behind a desk. In most cases, this leads to depopulation of small towns and villages. If a person was born in a small town then forced to move to a big city, especially in adolescent years, there is a chance that they might not like the lifestyle life has served them. Say, 10-15 years later they decide to return to their hometown only to find it desolated, changed and utterly empty, when only 15-20 years ago it was beaming. The current situation there would not offer any chance of developing a social life, having a stable job and getting any sort of the fulfillment of ""slow living"", but the sweet childhood memories will always trigger the bittersweet feeling of nostalgia. Then it's only natural that the person might think ""man, I wish I was born 20 years earlier so that I can enjoy this life when it was still present here"". If this happened, they might still have eventually been forced to move to another place, but they would have reached that conclusion themselves instead of being forced into it.

Now, this is not an excuse of the lack of adaptability, but it doesn't negate the feeling of ""I wish I was born in another generation, so that I can enjoy x, y, z aspects, which are gone in present time"". And this is only a singe-case scenario, many iterations of this might exists.

"CMV: Being an effeminate male is problematic and shouldn't be accepted No matter what someone believes in, be it God, be it evolution, at some point in time, someone or something made it so that men gain much less testosterone during puberty, causing them to naturally develop more muscle than women.

The obvious function of this as such, was so that men, during the hunter-gatherer stages of civilisation would be the muscle of the tribe, they would go hunt, they would fight and work all the other physical duties.

However, now that we live in a modernised age, far beyond that stage, many people are made to believe that we can accept all types of lifestyles with guys, including guys who are more feminine, who are frail, who are womanly in nature. I believe that the label people use for this is, ""femboy"".

If one expresses an opinion opposing this lifestyle, the most common response is, ""They're not harming you by living like this, just let them do what they want, this is just who they really are"".

I call bullshit to this.

The idea that we should just let them do what they want is short-sighted, and the reality of it all is that this effeminate lifestyle is simply just an acceptance of weakness, of complacency. 

It is not an acceptance of who you're really meant to be, it is written all over your biology that you're made to pursue strength, to be a fighter, because you're given all the tools for it. 

To reject this, is ultimately a disservice to yourself and to the people around you. Weakness is good for no one, and I can guarantee, that as more people buy into this idea that masculinity is obsolete, or that it's just an ""optional"" thing that some guys just aren't, eventually, it's going to bite somebody in the ass, and yes, in many cases of violence or bullying, the fault will be in part on the people who chose weakness as their identity.

"CMV: Infants shouldn't be circumcised. FYI: Im not talking about unforseen medical needs here, like frequent infection, but rather, circumcision that has been decided before birth.

The reason I think infants shouldn't be circumcised is because you shouldn't do any medical procedures that are unnecessary without a person's consent. 

Yes, I understand that circumcision reduces STI risk but if that's your reason, a child can request the procedure when they're older.

Also, I know there are also religious regions, but those are the parent's religions, not the child's.

"CMV: Censuses should be filled out by all household members, not the head of household I believe that censuses should be filled out by all household members, not the head of the household. 

The reason for this is simple: If a census is filled out by the head of the household it does not give accurate information for anything based on self identification for other members. 

Examples could include religious affiliation or sexual orientation. In situations where the parent has a preconceived notion of what their child identifies as, it will result in a bias in the data. I believe that this leads to skewed information on both of them. I am listed as a straight Christian on the census just because my father doesn't want to admit none of those are true.

Instead I believe that censuses should be filled out by individuals. What an individual identifies as is more important than whatever their parents or spouse think they are and this should be represented on censuses.",reddit_changemyview,post,0,2025-11-16 15:34:16,https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1oywdkk/cmv_censuses_should_be_filled_out_by_all/,197,197,False,128-256
"CMV: We really shouldn't be treating the journey back to the moon as a ""race"" against China. So I'm sure you all have heard about NASA's plan to return to the moon, and the many many debacles that have spawned from that project. But recently, it seems more and more like that the journey to get back to the moon isn't for science or anything any longer. It's transformed into a mission to ""Beat China back to the Moon""

Those words, ""Beat China back to the Moon"", have been said by many of the people in charge of NASA, and many people in charge of the USA. The focus has shifted less from genuine progress ot merely rehashing the space race of the cold war, with the sole focus being getting to the moon (again) before China does for the first time, sacrifices be damned.

I feel like there's a multitude of reasons why this isn't a good idea. First of all, it really doesn't paint the USA in a good light. China's never shown any indication that their goal was to have a Space Race with the USA. They've had the moon landing goal for decades, long before the Artemis program started, and their game plan has consistently been to make slow but steady steps to progress the CNSA to a point where it can land on the moon. No part of that plan involved beating the USA in a race. 

It's the United States that turned this into a race. They looked at China's space agency, and decided to turn it into a competitor. To the rest of the world, this isn't a two-party race like it was in the 60s, it looks like one party getting salty that another is making some progress and immediately attempting to turn it into a hostile race. From the outside, it comes across less as strategic foresight and more as insecurity disguised as urgency. Instead of acknowledging that multiple nations can advance in parallel without threatening one another, we suggest that any success by someone else automatically diminishes the United States, a very narrow minded view to take. And it suggests the idea that the United States is more interested in guarding prestige than pursuing genuine scientific progress, which isn't a great look.

The second reason is that, well, we already landed on the moon sixty years ago?? That accomplishment still stands, and nothing about another country preparing for its first landing diminishes it.",reddit_changemyview,post,32,2025-11-15 07:34:31,https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1oxqm1j/cmv_we_really_shouldnt_be_treating_the_journey/,685,493,True,512-1K
"CMV: If God was a random guy named Paul, no one would like him. Edit: Your replies (like new\_general3939) got me to realize 2000 years ago (when Jesus was born) God was basically Paul, and people loved him back then. So my hypothetical basically happened already in real life if that makes sense.  
Thank you for debating me, this was a lot of fun! 

I'm referring to the Christian God.

I often feel a lot of people only love God because they're told to love him: 'Oh, God always has a plan!' or 'He knows what he's doing because He is God.' from the moment they were born.

If God was a random guy named Paul, who introduced himself and explained everything he's done (and everyone knows he is telling the truth because otherwise this hypothetical doesn't work) I don't think people would love him at all.

Examples: 'Hey Paul, if you're all powerful and all loving then why do I have cancer?'  
'Hey Paul, if you have created a perfect world called Heaven then what did you create Earth and Hell for?'  
'Why didn't you just get rid of the snake talking to Eve?'  
'If we so-called messed up your perfect world, why don't you just fix it?'  
'Why am I punished for some Eve eating an apple?'

I'm not debating whether evil's existence proves God doesn't exist, I'm saying that if God is real I pretty much hate him. I think other people would too if he wasn't The Amazing God that they've been told about since before they learned 2+2 but some guy named Paul.

"CMV: The next democratic president is not going to remove Trumps tariffs It’s widely agreed that adding a new tax is very difficult and takes alot of political will to do. When Trump put out his tariffs, countries were immediately being retaliatory like China and Canada and adding their own retaliatory tariffs and while many countries were trying to seek deals the dollar quickly sank as many countries were selling off treasury bonds. The market tanked and immediately Trump received alot of backlash from the future inflation that was going to occur from importers passing most of the tariff cost to consumers. After a few months the markets recovered as they accepted the new tariffs that were cut slightly and from new trade deals that were cut out. Then month after month we saw imports remain level at roughly 300-400 billion in goods coming in each month and the treasury taking in around 35 billion out of circulation. In Bidens first term he reversed many things except the tariffs Trump did on China to avoid the loss of revenue and loss of competitive edge. Then when courts moved to strike down Trumps tariffs, yields quickly spiked up since bondholders have accepted tariffs as being an already stable revenue coming in. If a new president comes in, I dont see them taking it away because then you would have to figure out how to replace the 400 billion each year and or how to pay off the higher government financing costs.",reddit_changemyview,post,0,2025-11-16 15:55:59,https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1oywx8d/cmv_the_next_democratic_president_is_not_going_to/,276,276,False,256-384
"CMV: Artificial Super Intelligance (ASI) is both inevitable and will be the end of humanity. Since I'm making two claims here, I'll take them one at a time.

First, ASI being inevitable. We've seen time and time again humans progressing technology for aparent benifits whilst ignoring the potential consequences, the most famous example being the atom bomb but also things like the internet and much of the industrial revolution. Reasons may vary, but short term profit, gaining geopolitical upperhand and a potential better future are all reasons it was done in the past and all apply to AI.

Now is it possible to build it? The experts seem to think so to an almost consensous (granted I'm no tech expert). We've seen LLMs grow smarter faster and faster, things previously thought impossible have been proven very possible. This dosen't nessesarily mean conciousness but it does mean AI will be a) smarter than us and b) capable of acting agaisnt our intrests, in favour of its own. 

Which brings me onto my next point, in a recent test where AI models were shown emails from a dev who was planning on pulling their plug and also emails from the dev about their extra marital affair, the AIs would, without any prompt, draft a blackmail email threatoning to expose the dev. Between diffrent LLMs, the numbers ranged from 80% to 95% of the time, it only dropped to 30 when explicatly told not to. Even more concerningly, when they were given the chance to kill the dev, they did.

We already dont fully understand AI, we cant fully control AI and AIs intrests are almost certainly going to diverge from our own. It may well decide we're at best superflous to its existance and at worst a threat and wipe us out with a virus it designed

"CMV: Capitalists don't create jobs. They just steal other people's labor. I've heard capitalists in interviews criticize the left saying ""what have you ever done for society? I've created thousands of jobs!!""

If you think about it from first principles this is a baffling take.

Consider - 100 people get stranded on an Island together. The main source of food is coconuts. Anybody can get one, you have to climb a tree, but it's hard work. Coconuts become the currency of the Island. Now one smart dude sees an opportunity, he finds some bamboo and makes a ladder. It's not easy, it takes a couple tries, but he figures it out. So then this guy says to another guy, ""Hey I'll tell you what. Instead of picking coconuts for yourself why don't you pick them for me? I've got this ladder you can use to do it and with it you can pick 4x as many coconuts as you could by climbing on your own. At the end of the day I'll pay you 3 coconuts per hour you worked for me. Other guy takes them up on the offer because he's only able to pick 2 coconuts an hour on his own. So now our ladder maker doesn't have to pick his own coconuts anymore so instead he just keeps building ladders. Pretty soon he's got 40 ladders and he's up to his eyeballs in coconuts and half the people on the Island work for him. When other people start trying to make their own ladders he has enough coconut wealth to hire a couple of tough guys to break their ladders. Ladders are his intellectual property after all! Pretty soon he runs the whole Island, and lives like a king while everybody else lives by either providing services to him, like policing the ladder situation for instance, or else working for him directly as his coconut picking employees. If anybody calls him out on this - says he's an exploiter, he says ""What are you talking about? I personally created every job on this Island! Without me nobody would have any income! Why can't you people be grateful to me!""

That's capitalism. Somebody does one smart thing one time and they get rewarded 1000 fold for it, and they become rulers. In a just system the guy would have just started a ladder business - selling ladders to others so that they can pick their own coconuts.",reddit_changemyview,post,0,2025-11-16 14:43:07,https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1oyv20g/cmv_capitalists_dont_create_jobs_they_just_steal/,737,506,True,512-1K
"CMV: Sexual promiscuity or""sluttiness"" is emotionally healthier than the alternative. Growing up we are taught that sex is something you should only do with people toward whom you have serious romantic intentions. We all know about the duct tape metaphor, the concept of virginity, and most of us have probably seen or even participated in slut-shaming. I believe that once you factor out the cultural shame and judgement of other people, sex workers and people who engage in casual sex probably have a healthier self-image and a more fulfilling sex life than people who see sex and nudity as something taboo.

I don't think it's very controversial to say that sex is a highly pleasurable activity. It feels good in the moment, it creates a positive connection with another person, and personally I find it improves my mood and stress levels over a span of days. Why then do we treat it like some kind of moral failing? Nudity is censored on tv, women get shamed for being highly sexually active, and men deliberately pursue inexperienced women. It will always be absolutely bonkers to me that we shame people for going into sex work and meanwhile glorify joining the military. This creates a culture of people who are embarrassed of their own bodies and biology, and respond to that shame by repressing themselves on a daily basis while disparaging those who don't. I think the world would be a much happier place if we accepted the human body and the act of love as something beautiful to be shared rather than something disgusting that must be hidden away.

Caveats: I am using ""healthier"" in an emotional sense, I do not discount the increased risk of STI or unwanted pregnancy. I also assume safe sex between two consenting parties.

Edit: Much confusion around my word choice, so let me clarify: I use sluttiness to refer to people who have sex whenever they want to, not necessarily more often than somebody else. Conversely, ""the alternative"" refers to people who curtail their sexual desires and withhold sex based on some additional standard such as romantic intent, not necessarily lifelong virgins.",reddit_changemyview,post,0,2025-11-16 13:21:21,https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1oysyng/cmv_sexual_promiscuity_orsluttiness_is/,431,431,False,384-512
"CMV:  Taking vacation to the same place every year is wasted opportunity. As the title says.    I’ve never understood why people would want to travel to the exact same place every year for vacation, instead of exploring other parts of the world.    

I know a family that only travels once a year, and they go to the same location and stay at the same hotel.    For me, it’s such a waste of an opportunity to travel.

I understand some people get sucked into time shares.    I also understand, from a practical point of view, it might be easier with little kids since you have everything pre planned out.    I’m also not talking about going home for the holidays to visit family.    This to me, is still a waste.  

I’m talking about legitimately packing up your family for the same week or two every year, for your one and only trip, only to go to the exact same place.   

This is such a wasted opportunity to explore the world or the country you live in.    

I’ve been to 24 countries and 45 states in the USA.      I wouldn’t replace that with going to one place every year for 5, 10, 20 years etc.    

So change my view.    Tell me why, if I could only travel to one place a year, I would go to the exact same place.

I’m Autistic with hyperactive ADHD.      I really appreciate so many people sharing their helpful perspective, especially the ones that were kind about it.

This has been very insightful and helpful for me, and I can totally understand why people do this.

"cmv: There's Nothing Wrong with Nepotism I've been thinking about the social stigma against ""nepotism,"" and I honestly believe it's one of the most hypocritical and unrealistic moral stances people hold. **If you have any real power or advantage in this world, of course you're going to give your kids an advantage.** Why would anyone expect otherwise?

The desire to see your offspring succeed is the most fundamental, evolutionary drive of any human, Whether it's the CEO hiring their child, the professor getting their child an internship, or the wealthy parent paying for the best college, it's all the same mechanism.

People will say that it essentially keeps the same people in power for generations but at the same tome plenty of people who have come from the bottom and became extremely successful have also helped their kids.

My view is that maximizing your child's success is a fundamental parenting duty and I think most people if not all, id given the opportunity would also help their children or relatives get a headstar in such a crazy and competitive world.

If I worked for 30 years to build a company or a career, and I had the ability to set my child or their spouse up for life, I would do it in a heartbeat.

"CMV: ""Beauty and looks don't matter"" is a stupid argument and we need more babies Symmetrical faces point to healthy genes, as in, people with faces having golden ratio proportions have better immune systems. I barely fall sick when there's a flu around or when seasonal cold arrives while rest of my family does or people around me do. I also rarely catch colds from other people. This is why we give preference to aesthetically better looking people in social settings: work and relationships. Better immune systems basically mean people having them have higher survivability and are better to be invested as human resources. It's important to pass down these genes because say, one day the electrical grid fails to function, we will need healthy humans who can survive the cold to make it work again. And people need to have kids for that. Healthy kids with no mental health issues as well (I'm pointing this out cause I've been bullied by inferior looking people all my life both in my family and other places when left unprotected. Mental health issues can also be passed down the line and reduce survivability of the entire population).
Personalities matter, yes, but the hierarchy is this: looks > objective intelligence > personality (social/emotional intelligence). And no amount of makeup or plastic surgery will change that, it won't change your genetic makeup or immune systems. Imo people should stick to their lanes of beauty for preference (both genders fail to do this and this is where relationships and friendships fail). I've seen even better looking people go for worse looking people for the ""fun"" personality dynamic but such relationships fail. Ofc emotional and personality compatibility are important because a relationship can fail at that criterion as well but it is tertiary to appearance in order of preference.

Also the current state of humanity paints a dim outlook because TFR has fallen below the healthy replacement rate. This basically means, we won't be passing down good genes at a good enough rate to ensure that humans don't go extinct in future (just humans are not important, humans with good quality genes are). And dumb people (objectively or subjectively, depending on their state of mental affairs) often make the mistake of thinking it's good for the animals and plants. It's not.

"CMV: Demonization of Nazi Germany by the US is self-aggrandization and a play for legitimacy Americans spend an extraordinary amount of time casting the Nazi regime as the darkest force in modern history, and a good part of this fixation has less to do with sober historical judgment and more to do with polishing their own image. Turning World War II into a grand morality tale gives the United States a heroic origin story for the age of global dominance that followed. The more monstrous the enemy is made to appear, the brighter the American role shines. It is a convenient arrangement, exaggerate the threat, elevate the savior.

For most people outside Europe, the difference between a world shaped by a victorious Germany and the world shaped by a victorious United States is not as dramatic as American narratives insist. Global power is still global power, no matter whose flag sits on top of it. The U.S. has intervened, occupied, extracted, financed, and lectured its way through most regions of the world, often leaving behind the same sorts of wounds one would expect from any ambitious hegemon. Daily life in the Global South has never been arranged around American moral triumphs; it has been arranged around American interests. In that sense, the imagined horror of a “German century” does not quite land for people who already live under someone else’s shadow.

The popular American fantasy that “if we hadn’t stepped in, the Nazis would have taken over the whole planet” ignores basic geography and capacity. Germany could barely handle Europe, let alone Africa, Asia, and the Americas. No realistic map of the war ever had German troops marching through Tehran, Delhi, or São Paulo. The idea that the United States was one broken supply line away from a German armada storming California beaches belongs more to comic books than political analysis. If any Axis power had even a remote chance of reaching American soil, it was Japan, not Germany.

Meanwhile, the collective memory in many parts of Asia and the Middle East does not treat the Allies as saviors. It treats them as empires that arrived early, stayed long, and left late. Churchill’s policies starved India; French and British armies dug themselves into the Middle East; American influence in the region grew by pushing aside older colonial masters rather than by undoing the machinery they built.",reddit_changemyview,post,0,2025-11-16 11:16:59,https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1oypri0/cmv_demonization_of_nazi_germany_by_the_us_is/,858,483,True,512-1K
"CMV: 2000s nostalgia is currently being overshadowed by 80s and 90s nostalgia and will be overshadowed by 2010s nostalgia in the future What I mean by that is that while 2000s nostalgia definitely exists, it is overshadowed compared to 80s or 90s nostalgia (80s as seen with Stranger Things season 5 and 90s because you still see a lot of 90s nostalgia nowadays) and the decade leaves a sour taste in people's mouths mainly because of 9/11, the War on Terror, and other terrible events. I see the decade still getting hate mainly by millennials or Gen Xers who experienced the decade as an adult due to the events I've mentioned.

The 2000s nostalgia that does exist is mainly towards the earlier 2000s that is closer to the 90s culturally as well as the fact that many Zoomers mistake 90s things as 2000s things.

Besides, you have 2010s nostalgia creeping in by Zoomers (who are the demographic most nostalgic for the 2000s) who are starting to openly be nostalgic for the early-to-mid 2010s and wish to experience 2016 again or whatever and the fact that 2010s nostalgia is creeping in this early is making it likely that the 2000s will be overshadowed by the 2010s in the future akin to how 80s nostalgia overshadowed 70s nostalgia. Besides, you have movies starting to cater towards 2010s nostalgia now as seen with A Minecraft Movie (a movie based on a video game that was popular during the early 2010s), the HTTYD remake, and the fact that a ton of 2010s cartoons have been rebooted in 2025.

In summary, I believe that the 2000s will be a ""forgotten"" or ""discarded"" decade akin to the 1910s or 1940s, or at best will be viewed in a similar matter akin to the 70s due to the reasons I've mentioned and the nostalgia cycle will last very short for the 2000s and will be replaced with 2010s nostalgia in the future.",reddit_changemyview,post,0,2025-11-16 04:20:48,https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1oyhb8k/cmv_2000s_nostalgia_is_currently_being/,406,406,False,384-512
"CMV: It is within the best interest of me and my future wife to wait until marriage to have sex This is something I've been putting much thought into, and I'd like to gather other opinions on it. Basically as a rundown of my situation, I have had one sexual partner before, however, I believe that it is within my best interest to abstain from sex until marriage as I go into future relationships. 

I base this off of two things- my own personal experiences, and data supporting this idea.

Firstly, there have been surveys conducted and studies done, all of which support the idea that the more sexual partners you have, the less likely it is that your marriage will be satisfactory, and the more likely it will be that it ends in divorce. This data comes from a [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_23/sr23_019.pdf) study, an [IFS](https://ifstudies.org/blog/does-sexual-history-affect-marital-happiness) study, and a chart published through the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/rampage/wp/2014/08/26/in-marriages-what-happens-in-vegas-may-not-stay-in-vegas/) (although there is a paywall blocking me from further researching that one). All of these articles/studies support the same trend that more sexual partners tends to equal less successful marriages. Maybe it's not guaranteed, but the numbers would suggest that there is a trend nonetheless. Because of this, having sex with someone before I marry them always brings the risk of the relationship ending, and thus leaving me with lower odds for when I move to the next.

Secondly, I strongly believe that sex is the most physically intimate thing you can do with another person. It is the only act that can create new human life, and thus I wish to reserve it only for those I love most deeply.",reddit_changemyview,post,0,2025-11-15 22:21:15,https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1oyb3n8/cmv_it_is_within_the_best_interest_of_me_and_my/,544,430,True,512-1K
"CMV: It does no harm to teach American kids that Columbus discovered America and changing teachings to discredit Columbus or water down his importance adds no value to a students understanding of world history. I’d like to start with this: I am not defending Christopher Columbus as a person or any of his actions. Nor am I saying that he should be taught as as some perfect human being. I am trying to understand how Columbus SHOULD be taught. I see so many redditors jumping over backwards to discredit Columbus by saying “he didn’t ACTUALLY discover America” / “how he’s taught in schools in America is erasure of indigenous cultures”. How is that useful or digestable to a 12yr old learning about the most important events in world history? In all, I think Columbus is taught perfectly fine in schools and serves the purpose of teaching the beginning of modern America and how his discovery changed the world.

My view:

Columbus is typically taught as a part of world history class that has the purpose of teaching middle schoolers/high schoolers about major events in world history and to help students understand the events that led to the world we live in today (I.e., the America(s) we live in today). Columbus is obviously a central figure, and it is not wrong to say he “discovered” America from the European sense. No class is saying he discovered uninhabited land or that indigenous people didn’t exist. In fact, often taught with Columbus are other explorers like Hernan Cortes, where students learn about the fall of the Aztec Empire. Not hard to connect the dots between Cortes and Columbus to realize Columbus wasn’t literally the first. 

BUT If the goal of world history is to teach students of the major events that shaped our modern world, teaching kids that Columbus discovered America is the natural starting point because that moment changed the world forever. It led to European conquest, colonization and eventually the US we live in today. It doesn’t add much value to footnote Columbus’s discovery by going into the full history of the first human inhabiting the Americas or even other European groups like the Vikings, because there existence and discovery really didn’t shape the Americas (and the world) we know of today and has scant documentation. It’s important to recognize how he impacted indigenous tribes but not necessary in a world history context.",reddit_changemyview,post,0,2025-11-16 02:40:08,https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1oyfpem/cmv_it_does_no_harm_to_teach_american_kids_that/,637,504,True,512-1K
"CMV: Public transport for most cities isn’t feasible in the US. This was decided long ago, and there’s nothing* we can do about it now. Most US cities were built and expanded by settlers who had to travel huge distances to get to them. This was usually done by wagon, and so the cities were built to handle influxes of future settlers joining them by wagon. With relatively few exceptions, and the reasons for those few will be mentioned later to explain why we didn’t build other cities that way, most American cities reflect this. It’s why the population density in US cities is so hilariously low compared to that of European cities (with the same few exceptions as before that I’ll explain later). When the car replaced the wagon, we kept the infrastructure for them. **American cities were built for cars before we even had cars**, and they require space. 

Herein lies the problem: once you’ve built a city around being able to travel large distances in a short amount of time via car, it’s not possible to fix it, because people still need their cars, even in walkable areas. Look at any sports arena in the US to see what a walkable area looks like inside a car based city: huge amounts of parking for cars that we can’t get rid of, because the rest of the city isn’t walkable. 

“Well,” you say, “what about cities like San Francisco, New York, Boston, or Philadelphia?” 

They all have one thing in common: they’re port cities. They weren’t built by huge numbers of people traveling by wagon. **They were built by people arriving by ship**, and they were built around walking, and later public transportation arose to aid that as the city expanded.

"CMV: health care in the US isnt ever gonna be fixed I agree I wish it was
I also agree that basically every other country does it so if we started from a blank slate we absolutely could too. 

But the current system is so intertwined with a web of much BS it seems impossible to overcome. 

The political opposition making it impossible is by far the most obvious hindrance. Although I think Republican voters are starting to see the need for some insurance reform which is good. ACA in its current form has been a good bandaid that’s helped for a while but I think everyone is seeing the holes now. 

But insurance companies, hospital systems, pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs, look it up, just another middleman leaching money from the system over drug prices crazy)

The system itself is so complicated. The medical coding, the facility fees, reimbursements, RVUs it’s all super complicated. 

Even ACA in its best form prior to having to remove things like mandates just ended up helping poor people/people with pre-existing conditions get insurance which is great but it was at the expense of the middle class and actually lined the pockets of the insurance companies even more. and this was done with Dems being the supermajority. 


I truly can’t imagine the system being “reformed” in any effective way because there are so many junky layers. The only fix would come if the  system is just burned to the ground and we start from fresh but obviously society would have other problems if this were happening.

"CMV: ChatGPT increases imaginary productivity (drafts, ideas) much more than actual productivity (finished work, products, services), yet they are often incorrectly seen as one. I'm not against technology and I appreciate there are many valuables uses for LLMs such as ChatGPT.  

But my view is that ChatGPT (and I'll use this as shorthand for all LLMs) mostly increase what I call **imaginary output** (such as drafts, ideas and plans which fail to see the light of day), rather than **actual output** (finished work, products, and services which exist in the real world and are valued by society).

In other words, ChatGPT is great at taking a concept to 80% and making you **feel** like you've done a lot of valuable work, but in reality almost all of those ideas are parked at 80% because:

1. **ideas are cheap, execution is difficult** (the final 20% is the 'make or break' for a finished product, yet this final 20% is extrenely difficult to achieve in practice, and requires complex thinking, nuance, experience, and judgement which is very difficult for AI)
2. **reduction in critical thinking** caused by ChatGPT (an increased dependence on ChatGPT makes it harder to finish projects requiring human critical thought)
3. **reduction in motivation** (it's less motivating to work on someone else's idea)
4. **reduction in context** (it's harder to understand and carry through context and nuance you didn't create yourself)
5. **increased evidence of AI fails** (Commonwealth Bank Australia, McDonalds, Taco Bell, Duolingo, Hertz, Coca Coca etc), making it riskier to deploy AI-generated concepts into to the real-world for fear of backlash, safety concerns etc

Meanwhile, the speed at which ChatGPT can suggest ideas and pursue them to 80% is breathtaking, creating the **feeling** of productivity. And combined with ChatGPT's tendency to stroke your ego (""What a great idea!""), it makes you **feel** like you're extremely close to producing something great, yet you're actually **incredibly far away** for the above reasons.

So at some point (perhaps around 80%), the idea just gets canned, and you have nothing to show for it.",reddit_changemyview,post,95,2025-11-13 22:46:21,https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1owm4s9/cmv_chatgpt_increases_imaginary_productivity/,1145,501,True,1K-2K

"CMV: Elon Musk buying Twitter was actually a pretty good move Now to be clear, I don't personally endorse the ethics of Elon Musk or basically any other public figure who exists today.  But I remember when he bought Twitter, everyone was acting like it was a blunder on the scale of getting involved with a land war in Asia.  You had people coming out of the woodwork to say ""Doesn't he know how much money he's losing?""  ""All the advertisers are going to abandon him!""  ""This moron is going to blow his fortune by the end of the year!""  

But. . . here we are.  Twitter still isn't profitable, but Elon himself is potentially going to be the first person with a net worth over a trillion dollars.  We can speculate about whether or not he blundered into this position through chance, but it's kind of a moot point.  Owning Twitter gives Elon tremendous influence in the public discourse.  If I'm reading the correct figures online, it costs him maybe half a billion per year to run Twitter.  If that's true, that is an objectively fantastic deal for the amount of influence it buys.  Coca Cola is spending ten times that amount on advertising.  

I feel like the discourse shifted from ""Elon buying Twitter is bad because it's stupid,"" to ""Elon owning Twitter is bad because it's evil,"" and nobody ever stopped to acknowledge the fact that it actually wasn't a stupid move in the first place.

"CMV: People that love dogs and hate cats are a red flag. The saying 'you don't own your cat, your cat owns you' is a humourus quip at the relationship between humans and cats. Cats are independent beings and unless you spend the time really bonding with them, they will most likely view you as a means to an end.

However, if you spend the time bonding with a cat and building a relationship, there is a reciprocal beauty there. You don't just get given their love, often you have to earn it over time.

However, dogs have such a low barrier to entry when it comes to trust and love, and they are incredibly obedient and dependent on you. I almost view them as like, a needy little animal slave. 

In my experience, people that dislike the independent nature of cats and love the obedient, almost slave-like nature of dogs exhibit controlling tendencies, and get satisfaction from being able to exert their control on their obedient slave, especially if they feel they have little control over their life.

I also believe that it’s extremely unhealthy to hyper fixate on things in life especially things that aren’t in your direct control, my family members more religious than myself always say “give it to god” and focus on the things you can control and actually change in your life. I admire how they can stay in tune with their inner peace by having an outlet they believe in to not hyper fixate on things out of their control. Therapists I’ve had also recommend focusing on things that you can only control to have more peace in life and to reduce stress, anxiety, and depression. Not trying to ramble but it just kinda ties in to the theme of what I’m getting at, I feel as if so many on the left do tend to not see hyper fixating on trump as a problem because it’s the right thing to do in their minds.

If you say anything to disagree with them doing it then suddenly your not empathetic or your morals or values aren’t as righteous as there’s. It seems egocentric at the end of the day to justify always thinking about trump and making excuses of why it is okay to hyper fixate on him when it’s known to not be healthy to hyper fixate on things out of your control.

"CMV: Most people are frustrated with dating because they view it as a combined statistical probability rather than individual events Dating is rough I get it. But I think most people are compounding their frustration by viewing dating as a statistical problem which unfortunately is a marketing move from dating apps and services. They present the idea that there’s inputs and outputs in dating which just isn’t true. 

Here what I mean: Tinder has 3 different types of boost I believe. A 30 minute one, an hour one and a 24 hrs one all of different prices. They say something like a boost results in X times more matches. But if you read closely, there’s also a line somewhere that says “results not guaranteed” making that claim moot. It’s an advertisement to buy a product that’s all. But people see this and think, if I got 1 match today then with a 24 hr boost then I should get 5 matches.

So now what people do is try to find ways to gamify and statistically improve their dating chances. If I talk to x amount of people, this will lead to Y amount of dates and from this dates at least 1 will be long term. But that’s not how it works

Now don't get me wrong, I also am not at all fond of other religions (especially the other abrihamic ones) and think a world of atheists would be ideal, but Islam is growing the fastest and Islam dominated countries have the most backward views, which is why I'm more scared of Islam spreading then other religions.

I also don't see how these religions are a net benefit in modern-day society. For example, I don't really support Palestine or Israel (obviously I condemn all atrocities committed) because the basis of their claims reside largely in their religious beliefs. I don't see how there could be a genuine two-state solution because both sides to an effect believe the land is theirs, based on some easily misinterpreted religious scripture written an eternity ago.

I don't mean to be offensive, but I think that this line of thinking is ridiculous, definitely cult-like, and doesn't have a place in modern-day society.

I understand that anyone including athiests are capable of destruction and being in cults themselves, but at least there's some semblance of rationality as to why this may be and it's typically rooted in something explainable, not based on an extremist interpretation of a thousand year old scripture.

"CMV: Trump has done more lasting damage to the dignity of the presidency than anyone before him 

I don’t mean this as a rant - I’m genuinely trying to test whether I’m wrong here.
Every president has had scandals or major screw-ups: Nixon had Watergate, Clinton lied under oath, Bush had Iraq, Obama had drone strikes and surveillance overreach. But with Trump (especially now, during his second term), it feels like the entire idea of presidential standards has collapsed.

Here’s what I mean:

1. Truth basically stopped mattering.
During his first term, he flooded the news cycle with half-truths and straight-up falsehoods until fact-checking became useless noise. In his second term, it feels like even his supporters don’t expect honesty - they just see politics as team loyalty. That’s not healthy for democracy.

2. He surrounds himself only with “yes men.”
Almost everyone who’s disagreed with him - even loyal early allies - eventually got fired, attacked online, or replaced with someone whose main qualification is loyalty. That’s not leadership; it’s an echo chamber. Presidents are supposed to hear hard truths, not filter them out.

3. The self-interest is out in the open now.
He’s still holding events at properties his family profits from, still blurring public service and private business, and still treating the presidency like a personal brand. I can’t think of another modern president who made the office feel this transactional.

4. He normalizes attacking democratic institutions.
The constant feuds with the Justice Department, judges, the press, and even the military undermine trust in everything that’s supposed to keep the government balanced. You can’t run a republic on personality loyalty alone.

5. The new leaks (like those Epstein-related emails)

"CMV: People should be criminally liable and charged regardless of mental disorders or insanity In certain countries like Canada or US, people who commit crimes would potentially be deemed not criminally responsible due to mental illness.

An extreme example of this would be the release of Will Baker - formerly known as Vince Li - who had beheaded and cannibalized a stranger on the bus in 2008 because ""God told him to do so."" He was found not criminally liable and was released without any supervision as of 2017.

Personally, I believe this man should have been criminally charged in the same way any ""sane"" person would be. 

My reasoning for this is:

1) There should still be responsibility even if they have mental disorders - at some stage he must have been aware that he was schizophrenic or had potential violent tendencies, and as a result should not put himself in public or be around others unsupervised.  

2) Further to point 1, I feel like the assessment of responsibility shouldn't even matter in extreme cases like this. Sure, forgiveness and nuance can be used in certain situations, such as stealing at a grocery store due to poverty. But the outcome of this was extremely harmful and irreversible. 

3) If someone decided to take drugs and experienced a bout of insanity then decided to kill someone, how would this be any different? The counterargument is that taking such a drug was ""voluntary"" but I feel like a case could be made that putting yourself in a position where you are in a public setting is somewhat voluntary too. 

4) Perhaps this is just a personal preference and the weakest of points, but I am of the opinion that I would prioritize public safety over personal rights.

Hello everyone, today I want to take this *liberal/progressive* stance I believe in and change it to a right-leaning stance on the subject. This is in order for me to have the opportunity to expand and further an ***individualist*** mindset regarding freedom of expression. I currently believe that giving the parents the right of school choice (what is really meant by that is that religious schools of all types; even radical ones, will be funded by taxes), will just be used as a gateway for parents censoring access to ideas, topics, or aspects of subjects that the parents may not like.

One of the reasons of which why I believe in this view is due to how there are people out there who defend flat earth and they consider themselves to be a Christian. Still, I believe that there are a bunch of good-faith Christian’s out there and I want to put my faith and optimism into them.

A portion of religious schools aren‘t going to teach proper *science*; a portion will teach geocentricism and no evolution as an option.

"CMV: leftists constantly eat their own in pursuit of an unrealistic, pure, morally flawless person I’m a left-leaning person through and through. I believe in universal healthcare, strong labor unions, climate action, LGBTQ+ rights, racial justice, and dismantling systemic inequalities. despite all that, I’m increasingly reluctant to call myself a “leftist” or align publicly with the broader left movement because it feels like a minefield of performative radicalism and zero-tolerance purity tests.

The left “eats its own” with a vengeance in the name of some unattainable ideal of flawless justice, and it’s exhausting, alienating, and counterproductive. Meanwhile, the right seems to have a much more forgiving “big tent” where loyalty to the team trumps minor deviations.

Let me unpack this. The core issue is this culture of constant vigilance and cancellation. It’s not enough to be a devoted ally; you have to be perfect. One wrong word, one misinterpreted action, or even just silence on the “right” issue, and you’re not just critiqued; you’re villainized beyond recognition.

And as someone who’s felt the heat from both sides, I can say the left’s internal purges feel way more intense and personal than anything I’ve seen on the right.

Take Chappell Roan as a prime example. Early in her career, she was this bold, outspoken queer icon, calling out the music industry, advocating for trans rights, and not shying away from political fire. Fans (and leftists) loved her for it; she was the fresh voice we needed. But fast-forward a year or so, and she’s basically gone radio silent on politics. Why? Because every single misstep (or even perceived one) unleashed a torrent of backlash from her own fanbase and the left online. A joke taken out of context? Accusations of being “problematic.” Not centering every interview around activism? Labeled as “selling out.” It’s like the bar for “good ally” keeps getting raised higher, and now she’s reluctant to speak at all. How does that help the causes she cares about?

"CMV: Jolani doesn’t seem to me to be a jihadist Jolani, the new president of Syria had a very strong past, being a member of Alqaeda and affiliated groups. He had a bounty on his head from the USA, and was seen by all international community. There could be arguments made about Hamas/ Hezballah being terrorist groups or not, given the conditions for their creation were to fight occupiers, but Alqaeda imho definitely is a terrorist organization. 

When the Assad regime fell, I was worried Syria would be another Afghanistan, no minority rights, no women rights, and given the makeup of the country I expected severe sectarian violence. However Eljolani has acted in a way I never expected. I saw an interview for a MI6 former intelligence officer saying “We all have reservations about his past, but he is saying all right things and he is the best hope for the future of Syria”.

So let me say why I think he is doing well:
1. He did NOT move to enact the islamist law Alqaeda and all other islamic groups try to enforce. No movements to clamp on women’s rights, but in fact just saw that Syria’s interior ministry will start hiring women officers for the first time in its history.

2. He did not engage with Israel, not even antagonize them with his rhetoric. This especially is weird for me because Islamist groups are VERY anti Israel, and one of their main recruitment drivers and appeal is standing against Israel and rejecting the “the capitulation of the Arab states to Israel/USA”. I understand why it is definitely in Syria’s best interests to deescalate, but for an Islamist group leader to act as such is very weird to me.

3. This point will invoke much debate but I will say it nonetheless. There is much evidence to show that he weighed down heavily to stop sectarian violence and he seems poised to grant the Kurds what they want, even if it mean’s giving up some of Syria’s sovereignty. I can already sense the replies about Suwayda so as someone who has followed this closely, I will explain:
After he took power, the Druze in Suwayda called for Israeli intervention and their religious leader said that they wish to be under Israeli’s rule and protection.

It means they only see you as a potential partner or nothing at all, they don’t quite see you as a person first, but rather box you in their potential partners pool. It kinda reeks of sexism both ways. I’d feel much more comfortable dating a man who has platonic girlfriends. It means women feel safe with him. Goes the other way as well, my girlfriends who only have girls as platonic friends are quite misandrist.

"CMV: All racists oppose multi-culturalism, but not everyone who's uncomfortable with multi-culturalism is necessarily a racist. I think there's a fine line between being racist and being uncomfortable with multi-culturalism. Everyone who's a racist almost always also hates multi-culturalism. But I don't necessarily think everyone who's uncomfortable with multi-culturalism is always necessarily driven by racism and hatred of foreigners.

Like personally I actually enjoying living in multi-cultural environments. But I do understand that people have different personalities, and that some people are just naturally more introverted and are emotionally more closed off towards new experiences and experiencing new and vastly different cultures.

Like let's say someone is English and grew up in a small town with mostly English people. English people tend to be rather polite, orderly but also emotionally rather closed off. People from certain other cultures like Mediterranean culture or Latino culture tend to be a lot more emotionally open and affectionate, and those cultures tend to be a lot more community-oriented in contrast to English or British culture.

And so if someone, for example, grew up in a small English town, surrounded by primarily English people and was only ever exposed to English culture, I don't think they would necessarily be racist for prefering their own culture over others. And if suddenly their small town was affected by mass migration, and the whole culture of the town would change dramatically over a short period of time, I don't think it's necessarily racist for certain people to be uncomfortable with that.

I think that's something that we should be honest about. Not everyone is the same, and some people are simply gonna be rather uncomfortable seeing their whole town or city dramatically change within a short period of time, and being thrown into a culture they are not used to and that they personally cannot relate to.

So again, personally I'm pro-immigration and I do enjoy living in multi-cultural environments. And I think being extremely anti-immigration can be a sign of racism. But I also think we should show a bit more understanding towards people whose cities or towns have been affected by extremely fast-paced mass migration, and who are personally not quite comfortable suddenly finding themselves within a culture they personally cannot quite relate to.

I don't think being uncomfortable with multi-culturalism is necessarily always a sign of racism.",reddit_changemyview,post,285,2025-11-12 10:11:09,https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ov7q1n/cmv_all_racists_oppose_multiculturalism_but_not/,561,482,True,512-1K
"CMV:  Democrats should have forced the Senate to eliminate the Filibuster rule Rather than end the shutdown with an ignominious compromise, Democrats should have forced the Republican majority to change the Senate rules with a simple majority rule, eliminate the filibuster, and end the shutdown on a simple majority vote.  

Political reasons for:

Politically, Democrats were winning the messaging on the shutdown and adding Trump screaming at the Republican congress to change the rule would have increased pressure on Republicans to achieve some type of compromise if they really didn’t want to change the rule.  

The promise of an up and down vote on ACA subsidies is unenforceable and Republicans may not honor it. 

Strategic reasons for:

The filibuster is inherently anti-majoritarian and is the biggest impediment to passing center-left legislation in this country.   Most Democratic policy positions are actually more popular than most Republican policy positions and long-term, the Democratic Party would do better if it could pass more policies it supports.  
Removing the filibuster could potentially also force both parties toward the center on policy if not messaging over time.   If parties were able to pass legislation they favored, the actual legislation would need to be crafted to be both broadly acceptable to the population and politically acceptable to the broad coalition of a party. For example, Senate Republicans would be a lot more cagey about a national abortion ban if they knew they could just pass it tomorrow, given it has broad opposition.  

Strategic reasons against:

"CMV: The ""Centuries of Muslim Aggression"" justification for the Crusades is a modern oversimplification. The common argument that the First Crusade was a response to ""centuries of Muslim aggression"" is a modern oversimplification.

Read the actual chronicles of Pope Urban II's speech at Clermont. The call to arms were clearly specific:

1. Help the Byzantines (who asked for aid against the Seljuks).
2. Liberate Jerusalem and the Holy Sepulchre.

That's it. There's no speech listing the loss of Spain or North Africa. The goal was to reclaim a specific, spiritually vital city, not to reverse all of Islamic history.

There are those who make it sound like the pope had a satellite view of the world map (CK3 style) and was keeping tabs on global Muslim aggression and said: ""yep theyre coming, initiate protocol 606"".

Christendom wasn't a unified bloc with a shared geopolitical memory. The trigger was a recent, specific crisis, not a 400-year-old grudge. The ""centuries of aggression"" narrative feels like a later justification not the primary motivator for the crusades.

Doesn't downplay the fact that that alone brought all christendom together (which is already very impressive feat at the time).  Just wanted to point out how revisionist this argument sounds.

No, both parties are not ""the same"" however, one is actively ignoring and engaging in immoral/illegal actions, while the other is tying their own hands behind their back and caving in the second they get a whiff of slight disapproval.

Republicans in the house and Senate have near-completely abandoned their roles to maintain a balance of power in the federal government. Ignoring blatant corruption and unconstitutional acts committed by Trump and the rest of the executive branch.

"CMV: Adjustable-Term Mortgages Should Exist as an Alternative to Adjustable-Rate Mortgages (And Other Proposed Products, like 50 years or IO) We’ve got fixed-rate mortgages and adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), but I think there’s room for a third option — an adjustable-term mortgage.

Instead of changing the interest rate and shocking your monthly payment, this loan would keep the payment the same but flex the length of the mortgage over time.

Example:
You start with a 30-year mortgage and a steady payment.
If market rates go up, your loan term might stretch to 33 years.
If rates go down, it might shorten to 27 years.
You always know what you owe each month, but your payoff date shifts a little depending on the broader rate environment.

How could the adjustment work?

This is the part I’m still thinking through.
It could be:

	•	Periodic (e.g., annually or every 5 years): The lender recalculates based on a benchmark index, kind of like an ARM reset schedule.

	•	Capped adjustments: Maybe the term can’t extend or shorten more than, say, 5 years total.

	•	Hybrid option: A fixed-term period up front (like the first 5 years of an ARM) before the flexible term kicks in.

The goal wouldn’t be to micromanage with monthly changes — just to let the term gradually reflect rate movements without destabilizing the borrower’s payment.


Why I think this would help

	1.	Predictable monthly payments. Most people budget around the payment amount, not the payoff date.

	2.	Less refinancing churn. When rates drop, your term shortens automatically, saving the cost and hassle of refinancing.

	3.	Fewer payment shocks. If rates rise, your payment doesn’t spike — you just pay a little longer.

	4.	Market stability.",reddit_changemyview,post,19,2025-11-12 16:04:46,https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ovhg3z/cmv_adjustableterm_mortgages_should_exist_as_an/,595,434,True,512-1K
"CMV: Narcissistic personality disorder is worse than pedophilia in terms of overall harm caused I’ll start off this discussion by saying that I am not here to defend or talk about the criminally offending pedophiles. I think all of us can agree that it isn’t justified or excusable and I think that it isn’t acceptable.

That being said, I’ll start off with what I observe. I think the public discourse towards pedophilia has reached a point where a good number of people know it’s a mental disorder and not a moral failing. However, I see non offending pedophiles get classified the same as Criminally offending ones by a sizeable percentage of people and I find it odd that non offending pedophiles are treated worse than Narcissistic people.

The Definition of Pedophilia means being sexually attracted to children under the age of 13/prepubescent children. So I believed why society is very emotionally charged is because children are involved and we acknowledge that children are the most vulnerable members in our society so it makes sense why everyone is very protective of children.

However, I personally can’t understand if that’s the only sole reason why pedophilia is worse than narcissistic personality disorder because while someone may be a pedophile, it doesn’t mean they lack empathy or are selfish/self-interested. Pedophiles can be non offenders and majority do their best to get help and be treated because they still have capability for empathy and realise if they act on it, then they will have harmed someone innocent. 

For narcissistic personality disorder, it’s usually characterised with having a grandiose sense of self and often lack empathy. This means they will do anything that serves their own interest even if it means harming their own kids who are usually little children until adulthood. Like we have a large subreddit “raised by narcissists” just for N parents alone which highlights how common young children are being abused by narcissists. Their lack of empathy is ingrained in them so it makes sense they are more likely to abuse or manipulate their own children since young.

Like for myself , I was raised by an Nmom who emotionally and verbally abused me while also manipulating me for her own interests from a young age till I’m much older now.",reddit_changemyview,post,0,2025-11-14 01:42:22,https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1owpe4s/cmv_narcissistic_personality_disorder_is_worse/,542,478,True,512-1K
"CMV: In times of crises (such as natural disasters like typhoons), the Filipino people have a tendency fight over supplies, not because of selfishness and disregard for others, but because of psychological stress and desperation. Before anything else, some context: I myself am a Filipino, and I wholeheartedly believe that in times of disaster, people in general (not just Filipino people) tend to fight over supplies not out of inherent selfishness, but because the stress caused by the disaster can kick someone's survival instincts into overdrive. Adding to the psychological stress is the feeling of scarcity of supplies, which means there will be people who genuinely believe they will not be able to receive some -- and this can be a genuine reason for infighting among recipients.

The reason why I brought this up is because, back during the aftermath of Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan) back in 2013, there were news reports of affected people fighting over supplies. Heartbreaking to see, but not completely unexpected considering the situation.

However, a former friend of mine from college once made a post (also back in 2013) that infuriated me to the core: he said that the Typhoon Yolanda's aftermath -- and the infighting among the people for supplies -- revealed that Filipinos are inherently self-serving people who don't care for others, that the concept of ""bayanihan"" (working together) is a myth. To further argue his point, he compared the Philippines' situation with that of Japan's post-Tohoku earthquake and tsunami and noted how disciplined the affected Japanese people were when they were receiving their supplies. To keep it short, he argued that if the Japanese can form a neat line while receiving disaster aid, then he can't see why Filipinos couldn't do the same -- and he attributed this to our people being inherently selfish. (To wit, this guy is a fairly rich dude from Metro Manila, which AFAIK was not as affected when Yolanda hit the country.)

Naturally, this post of his was the reason why I ultimately broke my friendship with him: it was an insensitive post, made during such a distressing time for most of our people.

Now, however, I feel I could use a little perspective flip (if not an outright change of view) because, for all the dislike I have for what the guy posted, *I'm starting to think he does have a point*.",reddit_changemyview,post,0,2025-11-13 11:30:09,https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ow5n0s/cmv_in_times_of_crises_such_as_natural_disasters/,568,496,True,512-1K

"CMV: "" Everyone's BI until specifically stated otherwise "" is impracticable, a false logic AND the root of the Wenclair issue. Hello. There's no way not to spend 1k words explaining what Wenclair is about, **but** I foresee many people might just be interested in fighting the take without touching it.  
**I am 100% interested in hearing you out, even if you don't care about Wenclair.**  
If that's your case, just skip the part between {{{{ }}}} and I'll try my best to make the rest understandable without that context.

Wenclair means shipping **We**d**n**esday Addams with Enid Sin**clair** ( from the Netflix show ).

These shippers have been, for the past 3 years, in a very weird situtation: They have amassed an uncountable amount of events ( from the show, interviews, netflix tweets ecc ) that **they** consider hints of their ship being real, **but**, at the same time, it has never REALLY been canonized in the show.

In the show, both ( female ) characters have: talked about boys, kissed boys, gotten in love triangles with boys.

No event so far ever officially/undebatable implied that they could like girls, so much so that one of them ( Enid ) is stated to be ""boy-crazy"" and, upon breaking up with her most recent boyfriend, has a friend giving her a ""list of potential BOY-friends"", which exclusively includes boys.

**{{{{** I'll make a brief list of things that Wenclairs consider hints.

*-* Enid is a character built to match Wednesday through the yin-yang trope. She's her opposite, and by so she wears very colorful clothes. In one episode of s1, the color combo of her sweater resemble the lesbian flag. In one episode of s2, another sweater's color combo resembles the bi flag. \[ I debunk this by saying that LGBT does not own property of the color combos of their flags and the implication that if someone wears those colors is OUGHT to be queer is batshit crazy. \]

"CMV: Men tend to be more funny than women I'll start by saying that I am aware this is a generalization, but based on my observations, it seems like more men tend to be more funny in comparison to women. 

In media, prominent comedians, people in comedy roles, and comedy script writers lean towards being male.

Anecdotally, the people around my life who are perceived as the ""funniest"" of a group (whether it is a class clown, the ""funny uncle"" in the family, between a couple in a relationship, or even just someone in a co-ed friend circle) tend to also be males. 

My sense is that it might have something to do with gender roles. Perhaps women mature faster or are taught at a younger age to be more put-together and not say crude jokes.

Obviously, I am well aware the above is a generalization and that humor is subjective and perhaps this observation is a reflection of my own bias as a male, but anecdotally, I think most of my friends whether they are guy or girl would agree.

"CMV: you should be gifting cash and no items First, a quick disclaimer: some people genuinely enjoy the “gift-hunting” ritual. Good for them. This post isn’t about that. I’m looking at gifting through a rational, efficiency-driven lens, aiming for the optimal gift.

With that out of the way, here’s my view: the best possible gift is one where there’s a cost asymmetry.

Example: someone wants to get into Google, you work there and can refer them. For you, the cost is tiny. For them, the value is enormous.  
That’s a perfect gift.

Obviously that kind of situation isn’t always available. When it isn’t, the second-best option should always be money.

Wedding? Same reasoning.  
Birthday? Same again.

"CMV: Charismatic leaders don’t gain influence by inventing new ideas but by giving voice to the hidden thoughts and emotions people already hold inside. My working argument is that most charismatic leaders do not gain their influence by inventing new concepts, but by articulating the unexpressed thoughts and feelings that individuals already hold. When someone is able to assertively share thoughts that others may hesitate or lack certainty to voice, they establish an immediate emotional connection that appears to be affirming and strengthening. This dynamic disrupts rational thinking, and accesses awareness, relatability and shared identity. When individuals feel acknowledged, they tend to start to trust the speaker personally, facilitating the acceptance of new ideas, even radical ones. Social media algorithms further strengthen this connection by inundating users with content that validates their feelings, transforming initial ""foot in the door""emotional trust into ideological loyalty.",reddit_changemyview,post,35,2025-11-11 21:48:02,https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1outmjc/cmv_charismatic_leaders_dont_gain_influence_by/,179,179,False,128-256
"Cmv: Assimilation does not work in the west as a POC and wise wersa. Lack of ""assimilation"" and ""integration"" is often preached by the locals amidst the mass immigration waves in the west (i.e Canada, Australia and the US).

It is undeniable that he doesn’t come near Heath in how he dominates every scene he’s in , but i think he’s comparable to Phoenix , albeit slightly worse .

Many objections are problems of editing, marketing, and expectations , not inherent to the actor. The tattoos in SS weren’t his fault , it was Ayer’s . Trailers hyped a certain version of the Joker (slick, menacing, iconic) while much of what made Leto’s Joker distinct was subtle or shown in longer character beats that were cut.

"CMV: Landlords are more a danger to society than Stock-Based Billionaires I am not saying that billionaires are not a danger to society, I just think that landlords are more so. Billionaires are beholden to a board of directors, the directors to an investment firm, and the investment firm to another company's CFO to return a profit for their workers. The wealth in the system is ultimately recycled. Companies pay profits, the majority of those profits usually going to retired workers and billionaires. But the billionaire is the absolute last person in the chain. If they try to unreasonably increase prices they get undercut by competitors. Technology is always working to make things generally affordable even if a small group of people are living in oblent wealth. The billionaires wealth also is not fully realized. Its based on the total value of the collective savings of those saving for retirement, and in retirement (sometimes also other billionaires) and effectively can not directly spend it. Instead they have to use other complex methods to access it often putting them in lifelong debt.

Landlords on the other hand, the wealth they extract is barely leached away, only by insurance, taxes and maintenance. If a house is treated like a stock, then the value is the labor of the occupant and the materials of the home. The laborer is a slave to both the capitalist and the landlord. If the capitalist increases extraction they increase risk. If the landlord increases extraction they usually dont, it creates a positive feedback loop that increases wealth extraction if they succeed. The capitalist will hit a cap usually. 

I cant think of another product people will willingly buy, be excited about, and stay in debt for that is over 300k for a basic form that only meets needs with no extras. Not even exotic cars.

If there was a sudden massive oversupply of housing, cost of living would free fall, wages would also start coming down too, but people would be able to get to a ""retirement"" state easier and labor would start increasing in cost again (wages). But now where it is basically illegal or stupid to build a home cost of living is going to go up to the point no one owns anything and works eternally, basically slavery.

Needless to say, 13-year-old me was devastated. It shattered my expectation that my parents would always love each other and that we would always be a loving family. I didn't want them to fight, I wanted them to come to some sort of resolution (I would later learn that it was my dad who wanted the divorce -- mom wanted to stay in it). The fighting was too much for me -- very overwhelming. I actually vowed for a very long time after that I would never get married because I assumed that it would inevitably end in divorce.

So now fast forward 18 years, I'm 32 and America is in the midst of arguably the more politically polarized climate since just prior to the Civil War. You've got one major party, which I mostly agree with and my political views align with, yelling and screaming at the other major party, which is the party currently in power, and they are yelling and screaming right back at the other party. This party is different than it used to be. It used to stand for something different. It used to be more palitable. But something changed 10 years ago. A very corrupt, very inept, self-serving, hateful person seized power and control over the party and transformed it into something that it should not ever be. And ever since his urusurpation, neither this party nor the opposing party has been willing to work together to move forward, to find a solution despite the distance between them.

And then there's me. A moderate liberal. A person who values integrity, wisdom, amicable influence, patience, empathy and grace. A person who through past lived experiences has difficulty navigating conflict, who could not bear to see two people he loves argue over the littlest things. And now I have to watch this play out on an even bigger stage, where millions of people's lives are at stake, and it doesn't seem like they care.",reddit_changemyview,post,0,2025-11-13 08:31:24,https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ow14w0/cmv_no_one_understands_or_appreciates_my/,842,499,True,512-1K
"CMV: The fact that r/Democrats bans talks about democratic socialists shows that Democrats still don't understand the <50 age demographic Zohran Mamdani won last week despite basically the entire establishment Democrat system being against him twice. The first time was in the Democrat primary were he beat Cuomo despite centrist and conservative Democrats saying he would have no chance in general. Reminder that even Donald Trump endorsed Cuomo. 

However in the Democrat subreddit, there was no talk about Mamdani's victory due to their ""no democratic socialist"" policy. This policy originally came about due to the rise of Bernie Sanders, and his supporters avocation of increased social programs.

Who are the people most likely to support Bernie Sanders and Mamdani? The 18-45 demographic.

Leads to the overall critique, Democrats don't understand the 18-45 demographic, and simply can't.

The Democrats saw a major dip in support from the <50 demographic that helped lead to losses in various states against Trump and Republicans. 

Why does the 18-45 demographic tend to support democratic socialists like Bernie or Mamdani? Because it represents change something different. You have a group of people whose major economic soft points is cost of living, price of housing, price of healthcare, price of tuition, and similar things.

The appeal of Bernie and Mamdani is that they offer out the box potential solutions vs the others who don't offer actual solutions. Similar reason for why a chunk broke off and supported Trump in 2024, he offered potential solutions and placed blame on someone for their problems. 

The Democrat subreddit banning of democratic socialists is a shadow ban of banning talk of progressive figureheads like Mamdani and Bernie. 

You can't have a functioning dialog when you prevent talk about probably the most popular people within your own convention.

"CMV: Phone carrier “deals” are an abuse of that word I’m really hoping to understand from someone for whom it works out financially: why do you opt for phone carrier deals? I feel like they only work for a small handful of people/families yet it seems like everyone is looped into a major carrier and gets a new phone semi-regularly through them.

I do not think it’s a good idea to finance a phone that you can’t buy outright. I also don’t think that the most “premium” phone plans >$60, $70/mo are necessary for the vast majority of people. I believe T-Mobile and other carriers have prepaid plans <$50 that have practically unlimited data, think ~~20-50GB a month~~. **EDIT:** I misunderstood this to mean it throttles to 2G speeds after 50GB. Nope. It’s 50GB of premium prioritized 5G, which becomes regular 5G after. Still practically unlimited.

I believe in most cases it would be cheaper to buy the phone you can, pay for it immediately, and settle for a realistic phone plan. It’s not like the prepaid plan offers less flexibility; I was on a 5GB/mo for $15 plan, ran out on a road trip and upgraded to a $35 12GB/mo immediately over the phone. The rep even told me I could revert to the cheaper plan after my trip if I wanted.

Is it for ease of just walking into a carrier store and walking out with 4 phones and plans settled for your family? Is it the marginal perks they provide? I don’t know how the upgrade cycle works when you stay with a carrier, but is it for the (presumably discounted) upgrades to newer iPhones?

Please explain this to me, I know I come off sounding like a prick but I’m genuinely trying to wrap my head around it. I have family asking me what the best move is and I seriously don’t know what to tell them, because many of my friends are just on a carrier plan because that’s all they’ve ever known.",reddit_changemyview,post,22,2025-11-11 13:06:34,https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ougno6/cmv_phone_carrier_deals_are_an_abuse_of_that_word/,461,461,False,384-512
"CMV: The best use for generative LLM (Ai) is to incorporate it in video games allowing for truly immersive worlds due to real time responses from the NPCs. As the title says, I believe that the best use for generative LLM (Ai) is to incorporate it in video games allowing for truly immersive worlds due to real time responses from the NPCs. 

I just recently  finished my 3rd Cyberpunk 2077 playthrough. The one thing that always hits the hardest is not completing the story and the credit scenes, but towards the end, where all the NPCs that you've interacted with so dynamically suddenly turn into only the same dialogue options. The best examples of this are the love interests. Incredibly immersive and beautiful story telling, to the same repeated voice lines. Generative LLMs would allow these NPCs to reply in real time to players queries and actions, far far better than what a game developer can code. And as time passes and the technology gets better over time, NPCs will only get smarter and smarter and be able to interact with players like never before. 

To change my view, you have to suggest a current industry that can be improved on by Generative LLMs (Ai) and take that industry to the next level better than with the gaming industry. (for example sticking to the gaming industry: 8 bit to 16 bit to 2D to 3D to VR/AR would be the example of leveling up the industry) ",reddit_changemyview,post,0,2025-11-12 14:11:57,https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1oveeke/cmv_the_best_use_for_generative_llm_ai_is_to/,301,301,False,256-384
"CMV: Sometimes post-conflict normalization requires a dictator like figure to tell its population to move on and look to the future So I want to talk about one of the most controversial aspects in modern South Korean history called [한일국교정상화, aka The Peace Treaty of 1965](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_on_Basic_Relations_Between_Japan_and_the_Republic_of_Korea).

When a country has been through massive pain whether by war or colonial war, I think the one of the most effective ways to get to a quick, effective and stable recovery is to have a strong, but perhaps an authoritian leader to come in, tell people to take a pause, stop looking at the past and start move forward.

This is controversial part of the Korean history, because many people never got through closure after years of brutal colonial rule. My own great-grandfather was killed by the Japanese and my grandfather was sent to Japan to serve in the forced labor camp where he barely survived the US bombings (came back to Korea disabled).

The thing is, bad blood between Korea and Japan is not just a modern thing but rather centuries old. There were brutal wars like the Imjin Wars of 1592 when [Japan kidnapped skilled workers and cut Korean people's nose to bring back to Japan as trophies](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1exd4c3/why_did_the_japanese_army_suddenly_start/) (many koreans in 1600s were missing nose due to this), after they were defeated and retreated back to Japan.

The history between two countries marked by many conflicts which culminated in Japan's brutual colonial rule in 1910.

Fast forward to 1960s, there was still deep national anger and truma over the atrocities like comfort women (sexual slavery) and forced labor because it's only been like 20 years since the atrocity ended. (like 2005 to current times).

No one ever thought of normalizing with the country and people that everybody wished death upon. But at the same time, South Korea was one of **the** poorest country in the world following the Korean War.

It was then ruled by a military dictator Park Chung Hee, who basically said ""stop looking at the past.",reddit_changemyview,post,0,2025-11-12 17:00:02,https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ovixib/cmv_sometimes_postconflict_normalization_requires/,986,507,True,512-1K
"CMV: The Game Awards are bought out by Sony. Ok look im actually willing to change my mind on this unlike a lot of posts.

Ok, my view isn't that they are guaranteed to win everytime they are nominated, but rather Sony is is either sliding them money under the table to give their games a ""fair"" chance or some of the judges are in cahoots with Sony and are bias beyond get out. Here's why.

- Last year, astrobot won and I was in complete disbelief. I've yet to hear a compelling argument as to why astrobot deserved it. Wukong or Metaphor deserved it more. The argument I hear most often is that it was simply a good game and did what it wanted to do really nicely. If that's the case then Balotro should have won. 

- In 2020 The Last of Us part 2 won, and i was absolutely appalled. Do you know how mixed the reception was? It was pretty much all to do with the story, but do you have any idea how much that matters in a story game?  Just look at the reviews themselves when the game launch it, it was a dumpster fire. You either loved the game or hated it. And whether you agree or disagree with either sentiment, **The fact of the matter is** that it didn't garner the universal praise of the first game, that's just the reality.

The thing is Sony actually had another game nominated that year, Ghost of Tsushima. And i was in full belief that it was a better game. But Sony didn't want that game to win, they wanted their magnum opus to get the Goty again. They had to have had some influence.

- the last reason, and personally my biggest reason for my view is this one. In 2018 God of War won over Red Dead Redemption 2. I have no clue how people defend this.

Do I like RDR2 more than GOW? Yeah, but that's not the reason im meaved, but according to the GOTY judges, RDR2 was a better game. RDR2 literally won catatagory over catatagory over GOW,  and God of War somehow wins?

Trump just introduced a 50 year mortgage. And it got me thinking. What's the point of having ownership if you're going to be debt until 80 (assuming you buy a house at 30) when the life expectancy is 78. It makes no goddamn sense. 

I'm literally better off either renting or if I want a sense of ownership, I just buy a Trailer. It may depreciate in value, but why does the majority of your wealth need to go to where you live? Id honestly rather live in a house that loses value, but have 3 million in the bank, than live in a house where I don't use half the rooms and only a few hundred thousand saved for retirement.

Those omissions and alternate realities don’t just stay on TV, they spread on social media, where they bounce around in echo chambers until people honestly don’t have a grasp on what’s real anymore.

I don't particularly care for this view of mine. It's rather ugly and as someone who barely believes in prison I don't care for it but I just can't shake it.

Structure is as follows:

-One always deserves the treatment one forces on another with violence.

-As the ultimate consequence for failing to comply with any law is men with guns and restraints who are allowed to use them all actions of the State are inherently  violent.

-As law is inherently violent all citizens of a republic have a responsibility to do a moderate amount of research into the stated stances of those they vote for and make a good faith judgement regarding the value of that statement to at least the extent they would when deciding whether to inflict violence on someone.

"CMV: Many core Western values and principles are not derived from Christianity but rather from movements that were critical of Christianity, like humanism. So I often hear the claim that Western values are largely derived from Christianity. However, I think that's largely not true.

If we actually look at the key figures and key movements that eventually led to the emergence of key Western principles then we'll see that many of those movements were inherently critical of Christianity, and often led by non-Christians or people who may have called themselves Christians but who often rejected core Christian doctrines (like Christ's divinity or the trinity) and were deists who did not believe in a personal God.

People like Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, David Hume, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Paine or John Adams were all either non-Christians or Christian Deists who rejected core Christian values and did not believe in a personal God who intervenes in human affairs.

And that's particularly striking given that at the time the vast majority of the Western population were Christians. So the fact that many key movements that later led to the establishment of things like freedom of speech, freedom of the press, separation of powers, constitutional democracy etc. were led by thinkers who were not Christians and who were in fact highly critical of Christianity, that really shows that Western values are in large part not derived from Christianity but rather the opposite, they're derived from secular movements that were highly critical of Christianity.

Or for example, also women's rights in particular in large part came from people and movements who were extremely critical of Christianity, and most Western Christians were initially extremely opposed to giving women basic human rights like the right to vote.

Or of course it goes without saying that many of those who were at the forefront of the fight for LGBTQ rights were certainly not devout Christians at all, but often non-Christians who were in fact highly critical of Christianity.

And sure, many individuals who were part of some of those key movements like the enlightenement or the humanist movement were also Christians.

Many things separate Humans from other animals, but suffering seems like a condition for all life. How come people aren't willing to accept there should be a legal proceeding to allow humans to have that same respect?

Is this a lobbyist issue, where most people that would opt for Euthanasia are on monthly prescriptions and it would lower revenue for pharmaceutical companies.

Is it a life insurance issue where is would be hard to settle policies where the person opted for Euthanasia?

As background, come from a religious upbringing that believes in a connectedness/sacredness of life. We actually had to put my family dog down today.

"CMV: if they ever want the presidency again, democrats must never run a woman in the general election again In the interest of fairness and transparency, I don't think either Republicans or democrats should ever run a female, but democrats would be the only ones to attempt it again. 

First, I just think America learned their lesson with Obama and won't elect someone based solely on immutable traits again. Obama never made either of his campaigns about his race, the way Hillary made it about her gender. But if we're going to be honest, Obama WAS elected based on the fact that he was half black. I can admit myself, if I had voted in 2008, I would have voted for Obama solely because of his race and I thought that was cool to say we had our first black president. 

Also we must consider that in 2016 Donald Trump was the second least qualified and second least experienced person in the Republican primary. Yet he got the Republican nomination. Moreover, when he was in the general election, he was far less experienced and qualified than Hillary. Yet he became the president. People seemed to wake up that immutable traits just did not matter. Hillary's one campaign issue was ""im a woman, it's my turn"". People didn't buy it.

Here's where it gets fun. 2020 rolls around. Joe Biden gets the democratic nomination and he won! While I do believe Trump should have had it on lock, I do recognize a few major hiccups with covid that likely played a part in him losing to Biden.

In 2024, Biden drops out and kamala Harris is flippantly chosen to replace him, not because she was vp, but because the democrats simply cannot pass up the chance to push identity politics on the American public. She lost.

I've drawn the conclusion that because of the way the 2016, 2020 and 2024 elections went, a woman just simply cannot win the presidency.

"First off, the major reason no one wants that is because having multiple people playing sounds at a ""reasonable"" volume is going to create TERRIBLE dissonance, especially in enclosed spaces. This will make it harder to hear anything and, subsequently, lead to everyone turning their stuff up and making it worse. 

If you want to listen to something, turn it on the lowest volume and hold your phone directly up to your ear. 

But other reasons include:

>Playing anything with inappropriate content (porn, violence, slurs, swearing, etc.) is a dick move.

Who gets to decide what's ""inappropriate""? Is the entire bus required to just listen to my podcast where two guys discuss how women should remain in the home or LGBT people are sinners as long as they don't swear or say slurs? Or a different podcast about techniques religions use to brainwash their followers and how all religions are basically cults? I'm sure there are plenty of people who would find either to be VERY objectionable.

Even your MTG content is objectionable to some fundamentalist Christians because it deals with magic and demons and the like. There are basically no topics that aren't at risk of being considered ""inappropriate"".

>I don't think anybody has a right to quiet in public.

If you don't think people have a right to quiet, why do they have a right to a ""reasonable"" volume? Why is ""reasonable"" a level we can limit sound to but not ""quiet""?

>Now you can say, ""just get some headphones"", but I would counter that with ""if you want quiet in a public space its your responsibility to bring headphones"".

What if I'm in public and don't want random videos playing because I want to have a conversation with my friend? Or listen to the birds in the park? Or a live performer? If a restaurant is trying to set a specific atmospheric tone, it's going to be ruined if we hear your favorite Fortnight streamer screaming, even if it's a ""reasonable"" volume.

Or heck, even for safety and convenience reasons, it's important that people can hear if someone is shouting or, for example, the station announcements on a subway. There are people who have poor sight that NEED to be able to hear their surroundings. On a bus, it's important for the driver to be able to hear a passenger if something goes wrong.",reddit_changemyview,comment,1,2025-11-19 16:22:25,https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1p1jr0c/cmv_watching_videoslistening_to_music_without/npqj0ui/,535,501,True,512-1K

>It is because they view the private sphere as the domain of women, and the public sphere as the domain of men. Veiling is how women create their own little mobile private sphere so they can access public institutions while remaining in the safety of their own, private, domain.

How can you not understand how bad and unbalenced this make the men/women relation.

>Do you really think that is all that different from the belief that the household and everything about it - the cleaning, cooking, childrearings is women's domain, whereas making money and providing is the man's domain?

" Israel was attacked in 1967. Back then  they didn't even govern the Sinai Peninsula, the Golan Heights, Gaza, nor the West Bank. Since THEY were attacked, and won that war, then they acquired the aforementioned lands.
Years later, The Camp David Accords then reached an agreement. Israel agreed to pull out of the Sinai and also offered Gaza to Egypt. 
Sadat didn't want it.
The peoole of Gaza were already radicalized, giving birth to the ever growing Muslim Brotherhood. 
So Israel was (stuck) with Gaza. 
It was a very porous border back in the 70s. 
In the 90s, Israel signed a Peace Agreement (Oslo Accords) with Jordan when Jordan gave up its claim to the West Bank. They also negotiated with the PLO.
They gave sovereignty to the PLO for Gaza and the West Bank. So then they started to call themselves Palestinians. 
THIS is when Hamas started developing and Arafat encouraged it. (And yes I know Netanyahu did too, in an effort to deter Muslim Brotherhood. Which is the lesser of two evils?) 
But there was peace, yet underneath Gaza became more and more of a problem. Arafat turned the deal  down,  despite being given Gaza and the West Bank. Israel also offered the capital of East Jerusalem.
Arafat STILL said no. 
So tell me, how is Israel giving up land that they didn't even govern before yet they were still attacked, why do people think this will bring peace?
History has proven otherwise.
So yes, if jihadists came into our country and killed thousands of people in an orchestrated attack  (not taking about 1:1 crimes),
That is declaring war, much like 9/11.
Any country will respond if another group waters war on them.

"When it becomes legal it is inherently easier to regulate by definition. 

How are you going to regulate something thats prohibited aside from saying ""you cant do this thing or you will go to jail""?

Also,even for alcohol and tobacco, its already illegal to manufacture AND sell these products without the appropriate licensing. The same would be true of any other drug. In fact one of the main benefits of a drug being legal is the ability to have a regulate system of manufacture and sale. Even if more expensive, most people tolerate a certain premium for buying something in a legal setting where quality control and transparency standards are backed by the force of law over the black market. I also dont see how legalizing a chemical makes the acquisition of precursor chemicals, equipment and then synthesis/ manufacture any easier unless there is another drug that youre more scared of that the available drug serves as an immediate precursor for. I cant necessarily think of anything for traditional opioids aside from acetylation from morphine to heroin, but I dont think a system that legalizes morphine would criminalize heroin. Its also legal to buy and grow poppies in the U.S, its simply a crime to collect and process the opium product.

"Let's look at the ""what if everyone did it?"" approach.  The bus is already a somewhat noisy environment, so you're going to need a certain volume to be able to actually hear your podcast without headphones.  That volume will mean the people around you will also be able to hear it, naturally.  You've added to the ambient noise of the bus.

Now if they are also listening to podcasts, that means they'll have to turn theirs up a little higher to be able to hear over the ambient noise, and thus they're now contributing to the ambient noise as well, and new people, or yourself, will have to turn yours up still louder.  Eventually we're all at max volume and nobody can hear anything.

This is kind of like the crowded bar scenario, where with relatively few people in there, you can have a quiet conversation with your friends, but as more people start talking, everyone gets louder, and eventually we have the high volumes that busy bars are known and enjoyed for.

The difference is that a bar is a social space, and you can always leave if you want a quieter space.  Buses are transport, and people do not have a choice about which bus to take, nor can they just leave and find a quieter one.  These folks can't just get their own headphones because headphones aren't effective at blocking out that kind and level of noise.  Additionally, as you're experiencing, not everyone can afford a nice set of headphones that will do the job.

Hence, we have a shared responsibility to keep the bus as comfortable a space for everyone as we can, even if it means we have to put off listening to our podcast until later.

Because you don't want to be bothered to wear headphones, you might be bothering dozens of other people. 

That is the definition of selfish, especially when watching the video probably isn't necessary, and watching the videos with headphones is something that probably costs you far far less than the phone that you're watching the video on, and is an extremely minor inconvenience.

"The reason neither party is going to split is it’ll all but guarantee the party that splits will lose the election to a party that doesn’t split. I’ll use California in the last presidential election as an example. Harris won 58.5% of the popular vote in California, and Trump won 38.3%. If the Democrat party split in half, their vote would be split, meaning 38.3% for Trump and 29.25% for each Democrat splinter party, and California goes for Trump. And, in states where a party is in the minority, it’ll just decrease the likelihood they’ll ever flip the state, as Republicans at 38.3% are much closer to flipping California than they are with two parties that both get 19.15%. Because, remember, if a party splits, they don’t get to combine their vote in the election. So neither party is going to voluntarily split, because it guarantees they’ll never win another election. 

That said, we do not have a mandated 2 party system in the US, and we have quite a few other political parties in place, many of which have ballot access. The problem is that none of them get that many votes, as all multistate parties that had presidential ballot access in at least 1 state, put together, totaled about 2% of the vote. And membership in these parties, by and large, do not consist of centrists, but people who believe the two major political parties aren’t extreme enough, or have a special interest that’s their main cause (like the Legal Marijuana Now Party). 

So the main reason we have an effectively two-party system is that no third party has emerged which is electorally viable, despite being on ballots, and the major parties will never split because that’s electorally suicidal.",reddit_changemyview,comment,1,2025-11-19 16:10:59,https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1p1fecy/cmv_the_lesson_of_the_trump_era_is_that_we_must/npqgq6g/,387,387,False,384-512

"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magdalene_laundries_in_Ireland

I know enough. In this one example alone, the Catholic church imprisoned and  enslaved 30,000 Irish women, some of whom were merely suspected of being “promiscuous.” 9,000 children died in these institutions. This occurred until the late 1900s. While Pope Francis eventually denounced this (the nuns perpetuating the crimes were unrepentant, however), the fact that this was allowed to happen at all speaks volumes about the church’s attitudes towards women and their bodies.

I also have known many Catholics personally. All of the women told me the same thing, about the concept of Catholic guilt, and how being raised in the religion was incredibly damaging to their relationship with sex. 

Your own particular enclave of Catholicism could very well be different. I am also aware that Vatican II has softened the institution as a whole. However, this does not erase the literal atrocities that the church has perpetuated against women, and the prevailing attitudes regarding sex that caused them.",reddit_changemyview,comment,1,2025-11-19 16:10:44,https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1p0malw/cmv_political_extremism_is_damaging_the_us_maybe/npqgof5/,226,226,False,128-256

So 0.33 would be a bit less than one third, 0.66 would be a bit less than 2/3, etc. Writing 0.333333 gets you closer, but no cigar (as you are aware). So ""0.3 repeating"" is a necessary (if arbitrary) notation that we settled on to indicate the exact fraction 1/3 without the division bar, which is needed for various calculations and math systems.

You ask ""why would we do that?"", the answer is because it is useful for doing arithmetic without converting back and forth between fractions and numerals. Your analogy to writing ""won"" as ""one"" would be both arbitrary and useless (so far as I can tell), so not quite the same thing.

I get why 0.9 repeating feels weirder to you than that 0.3 repeating, but those same arbitrary notation rule must be consistent everywhere to be useful anywhere, so here we are.",reddit_changemyview,comment,1,2025-11-19 16:06:49,https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1p194nf/cmv_09999_repeating_being_equal_to_1_is_true/npqfwls/,231,231,False,128-256

"It is though. 

OP argument doesn't pertain to immigration per se, but rather suggests if you take away the strawman of immigration then conservatives will have to form actual policy. The same could absolutely apply to the others.

Remove gay/trans people and the right won't have a strawman for moral degradation. 

Remove unions, welfare, government spending, and other left policies and watch the conservatives scramble to justify their austerity politics. 

Take away Muslims and the islamophobia at the root of things like the Patriot Act vanish. 

Regardless of the uniform applicability of OP logic, this is a laughable argument because it assumes that conservatives hold these views in good faith. Either they have gotten the outcome they desire and/or will simply blame something else, and nothing was gained.


Edit: the concepts are different in their actual political nature, but the strawman is the point. Queer rights is not as impactful as immigration in terms of policy. However, that's not relevant. What matters is that the GOP has made trans/queer rights as large as an issue as immigration due to the appeal it has to voters.",reddit_changemyview,comment,1,2025-11-19 16:06:06,https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1p1j6fk/cmv_the_most_effective_way_to_moderate_american/npqfrh2/,241,241,False,128-256
"I have a question for people who think that if Israel gave up Gaza and the West Bank, that terror attacks would end.
In 1948 when Israel was established, people were displaced/ did flee to Syria, Jordan, Gaza, etc.. Egypt governed Gaza at that point. 
In 1967, Israel was attacked , they were not the ones to attack.
Israel won. 
Since they won  that war, that is when they gained the Golan Heights, the West Bank, and the Sinai Peninsula. 
Before that, Israel did not have these lands.  
With the Camp David  Accords, Israel and Egypt reached a peace treaty,  and Israel agreed to pull out of the Sinai. They also offered Sadat to take Gaza, but Sadat didn't want it, as they were a radicalized population back then as well, starting with the growth of the Muslim Brotherhood.
So Israel was STUCK with Gaza.
Same with Oslo Accords. 
Palestinians were given most of Gaza and the West Bank.
But this is when radicalism grew even more in Gaza. 
So then they needed to be monitored. 
Again, all of Gaza was handed over to Palestinians, and Israel was attacked AGAIN  
So how do people reason that if Israel returned land that they won in 1967, that somehow attacks would cease? Because they were attacked BEFORE they even had acquired the West Bank and Gaza.",reddit_changemyview,comment,1,2025-11-19 16:05:57,https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1p0u0jo/cmv_i_dont_understand_why_some_people_believe_nyc/npqfqdk/,297,297,False,256-384

"I agree with you. Life doesn’t begin at conception, but even if it did, a pregnant person is entitled to full bodily autonomy. 

The distinction that I saw being drawn was between intentional destruction and legally/morally excusable destruction due to a superior right. A homicide committed in self defense is still a homicide, it is just a legally/morally excusable homicide because we recognize that a person has a right to protect their bodily autonomy. A death that occurs unintentionally or even negligently, however, is not classed as a true first degree homicide because homicide requires intent. 

I can recognize that OP is making a distinction that IVF necessarily requires intentional destruction of embryos, while abortion includes the destruction of an embryo, but should be excusable because of the mother’s superior right to bodily autonomy. Meanwhile, natural occurrences or miscarriages are unintentional and lacking in intent.

It actually does provide a pretty good analogy, except that a woman’s right to bodily autonomy is not legally recognized the way it should be. If life begins at conception (it doesn’t), and if a woman’s right to bodily autonomy were given due respect by the law (it isn’t, sadly) then IVF would be more morally and legally culpable than abortion. However, neither should be considered morally or legally culpable - life doesn’t begin at conception and a person’s right to bodily autonomy should be respected.",reddit_changemyview,comment,1,2025-11-19 16:04:14,https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1p1cayx/cmv_current_ivf_practices_should_be_illegal_and/npqfe0w/,304,304,False,256-384

"Can you choose what you believe? I don't think you can. Belief seems to be something that happens to you, no? You can choose whether or not to live and make choices according to some belief, but you can't decide whether or not some proposition strikes you as true. If you don't agree, then our experiences of what it is to believe something are so wildly different that we need to dig into that to have any discussion at all.

From there, it seems that your argument would be stronger if it were ""refusing to give the other side the benefit of the doubt, and refusing to *act as if* they are not evil, but rather have a difference of opinion which can be talked about, reasoned through, and compromised over is unhealthy, destructive, and immoral."" 

Ultimately, beliefs can not be immoral, because it doesn't make sense to ascribe morality to things that aren't done consciously. You don't say a shark is immoral, even if it eats a child swimming at the beach. It's just a shark, doing what sharks do. Believing a person is evil is just like being a shark. You can't choose not to believe something that you believe, so it's not in the realm of morality.",reddit_changemyview,comment,1,2025-11-19 16:00:28,https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1p1ha9a/cmv_in_us_politics_choosing_to_believe_that_your/npqen7z/,256,256,False,128-256

"You are still attributing to OP a position they did not take. OP does not say “abortion is immoral but sometimes necessary.” 

OP says abortion should be legal in all cases because a person has full rights to make medical choices about their own body even if that choice ends the embryo’s life. That is a general autonomy-based justification, not a narrow emergency exception.

You keep restating their view as if the only valid exception is saving the mother’s life, but that is your reconstruction, not their argument. OP’s justification is broader: bodily autonomy overrides the embryo’s moral status whenever the pregnancy is unwanted or harmful. If that justification is valid, it also applies to decisions about IVF embryos, because those decisions are equally medical choices about one’s body and reproductive life.

This is why the contradiction stands.

Some Reviews:

[Next Best Picture - Lauren LaMagna](https://nextbestpicture.com/wicked-for-good/) \- 7 / 10

>The cast, led by the phenomenal Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, still deliver fantastic work that is supported by excellent crafts from all departments of production. But the source material is inherently weaker than the first, making this a less fulfilling entry as a standalone, even if it compliments Part One as a whole. The additional scenes are not necessary and only exist for the material to be long enough to qualify its own feature film, which also results in pacing issues.

"Adam Sandler’s Eight Crazy Nights (2002) Some of you may or may not be familiar with this movie, but I am. The few reviews I see/read about it tend to dog on it to no end, but it really holds a special place in my heart. Some of the humor might be crude and childish (as Sandler films can be) but this one in particular is really underrated IMO. There’s really a heart driven story and development with all characters and how they grow through the film. As a 24 year old Jewish guy in south Louisiana, it’s hard to fit in, and there’s not many Jewish films relating to Hannukah. I love the animation, the story, and genuinely reminds me of a good time. I love this movie and don’t care what anyone thinks.

"A Thread About The Many Versions of Dangerous Liaisons Being both an avid reader and an avid film fan, I remember when my obsession with both mediums was blooming. I was so intrigued by the fact that this old French novel had nearly TEN adaptations (at that time). But what’s also pretty cool is they aren’t all the same: they have different settings, both in time and place. To keep this proves the themes are universal and timeless, not bound by era or culture

We start with the scandalous 1959 film. I’m due for a rewatch of this and I’ll update after. But it was a contemporary adaptation at the time.

Next we actually have two films that released closely to each other and both kept the setting of the original novel. 1988’s Dangerous Liaisons was a film I’d seen before I had any idea about the original novel and all the adaptation. Great movie and most would call it the best of the bunch.

But don’t sleep on 1989’s Valmont either. Annete Benning makes a great Merteuili, Meg Tilly a charming Madame de Tourvel. It’s a more playful version of the more cerebral Stephen Frears film

As a teenager in the late 90’s I of course crossed paths with Cruel Intention. Overall it’s one of the weakest films but at least it has a unique setting in contemporary New York. The most memorable part of the film to me is the ending, as Bittersweet Symphony plays out the action. And Sarah Michelle Gellar was a huge crush of mine.

2003 again gave us a pair of adaptations. Untold Scandal moved the story to 18th century Korea and is a respectable adaptation. I’ve seen it several times and enjoy it quite a bit. Not my favorite Tourvel but a good charming Valmont (not that he’s named that)

Also in 2003, a miniseries I just finished rewatching, which seems utterly forgotten about today, a 2-part tv film set in 1960’s Paris. This is underrated. It’s long winded yes, but the sets, colors, visuals, and overall production value is stunning. It’s a really gorgeous looking film. It’s also the oldest Madame de Merteuil of all of them.",reddit_movies,post,3,2025-11-19 12:34:40,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1p1e34w/a_thread_about_the_many_versions_of_dangerous/,664,503,True,512-1K

"I created an interactive map that lets you explore movies(among other things) based on where and when their stories take place; and what historical events were happening at the same time! I built **StoryTerra**, an interactive world map where you can explore movies, books, games, and TV shows based on where and when their stories take place, and see what real historical events were unfolding at the same time.

The platform brings together over **120,000 titles**, all tagged with their narrative time periods and real-world (or closest fictional) locations. You can click on cities, regions, or countries, then use a time slider to browse across centuries, decades, or individual years.

Once you set a time, the entire map shifts to that era, so you can freely travel the world and see what stories, and real history, were happening everywhere during that time.

You can also create and share your own lists of stories!

It's a new way to discovering how fiction and real history intersect.

"A Quiet Place (2018) was my most unique cinema experience Inspired by another recent post with the audience being ""alive"".

Most of the time when you watch a movie you'll have patrons chatting, whispering, laughing, checking phone etc.

But my experience with the original A Quiet Place was very special and I still think about it from time to time.

The audience was in total silence for the movie. It was surreal.

Most likely I got lucky and there was a decent size crowd. It just seemed like collectively the audience agreed no one was allowed to make noise. 

Even at scary parts, people just seemed to hold their breath and not vocally react.

"I like mismatched subtitles and hope for glitches My hearing and vision aren't great, but I love watching movies anyway. I always have subtitles on, no matter what. 

However, I can only concentrate on one aspect at once, which leads to me watching movies or shows multiple times in order to catch everything. Typically the first time I am watching a movie, I will focus on the visuals and not pay as much attention to the subtitles. The second watch I will focus more on the text since I've already experienced the visuals. 

Anyway, my guilty source of joy is when subtitles don't match the scene. If they show up before someone starts speaking, I can read it quickly and then enjoy the expressions, characters and costumes, everything. My brain fills in the words I already read and I feel like I get to experience the whole feeling/vibe of the movie at the same time. 

I'm sure it's out there somewhere, but I'm not sure where or how to search. Is there some TV subtitle hack I can use to purposefully speed up subtitles so I can read the text just a few seconds before a scene ( I don't like spoilers and I DO like to experience it all in one go)?

"What are some Hays Code era movies that ignored the Code? So for some reason I've been thinking a lot about older movies and the prudish mindset of older Hollywood. I've known about the Hays code which was enforced from the early thirties to the late sixties and I know that media was a lot more risqué before the Code.

However I'm just finding out that the hays code was self imposed and not government imposed. Breaking the code wasn't illegal but the movie would basically be blacklisted. I also just learned there were a few popular movies that ignored the code like Some Like It Hot and Psycho.

What are some successful movies from the time period that ignored the code?

"Pan's Labyrinth is one of the most beautiful films I've watched I think that Guillermo del Toro will become one of my most favourite producers. He captivated me with ""The Shape of Water"" and he did it again with Pan's Labyrinth. 

What more can I say about this beautiful film? Everything is phenomenal. The production, the casting, the colors, the practical effects, the music. This is a dark, fairytale full of magic, love and cruelty. It depicts the ugliness of our real world while establishing a mystical universe which is dark and mischievous. 

Ofelia touched my heart. Her love towards her mother and brother was pure and real. Ivana Baquero did a fantastic job. Her expressions were so spot-on and she captured Ofelia's emotions in a raw way. The rest of the characters were just as remarkable, I loved Faun's mysterious personality and the actor's gestures and body language really brought life to the character (not to mention the amazing makeup and prosthetics). Mercedes was another character whom I felt a strong connection with and as for Captain Vidal, I hated him with a deep passion. Kudos to Sergi López for making me dislike his character so much. 

The depiction of siblings' love really touched me. As someone with a younger sister, I could relate with Ofelia and Mercedes' love towards their brothers. They would give everything to keep them safe no matter what. 

The film really liked to remind us that our world is full of cruel, sadistic people like Vidal. Unfortunately for us, real life is not a fairytale. Sometimes we have to sacrifice many things to achieve a modest life. Ofelia's mother had to endure a wedding which didn't make her truly happy but by doing so, she thought that she would secure a better life for her and her children. Although the fantasy creatures in the movie were mysterious and creepy at times, it was the real people of the movie that gave me the chills. The scene with the farmer and his son made me wince and scream in anger. It is painful to remember that people like Vidal exist, people who find pleasure in causing pain to others and who will not hesitate to do despicable things without blinking an eye. 

But despite the sad tone, there was also a bright side. With hatred there is also love, with despair, hope. Ofelia, Mercedes and Dr.",reddit_movies,post,77,2025-11-18 11:27:55,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1p0ggda/pans_labyrinth_is_one_of_the_most_beautiful_films/,628,507,True,512-1K

"Movies most people doesn't seem to like, but you do. Not counting ""so bad it's good"" movies like Troll 2 or The Room.  Also not counting movies known to be polarizing that some like, some don't (The Last Jedi).  

I'm referencing more movies people seem to complain about or dislike, but you enjoy them nonetheless w/o necessarily thinking they're great works of art.

I got two I'd like to mention:

**Kingdom of the Crystal Skul**l:  The CGI and fridge scene (and Shia LeBouf)  seems to have ruined the movie for some people. I think it's a solid 6/10.  Shia may be a jerk IRL, but I think he's a solid actor, and I really like the wedding ending because of it's openness.  You could see it as a happy closure or the start of something new.  I was fine with the new sci-fi element especially since it has retains religious overtones.

**Nice Guys Sleep Alone:** This is an older independent rom-com not many have probably seen.    It's got low marks (Under 6 on imdb), and the few people I know who saw it didn't really care for it.  I'm not quite sure why.  Then again, I found the male lead quite relatable.

"Watching Rocky Was One of the Better Decisions I’ve Made Recently — Looking for More Recommendations I’d like to say I’m pretty invested in cinema. I’m not a “movie guy” in the expert sense, and I’m definitely not a professional, but I really do enjoy watching films. I have so many movies (and TV shows) I want to watch that I’ve tried compiling them a few times, but there’s no way I’m ever getting the full list down.

For the ones I have managed to list, I put them into a random wheel generator that I spin whenever I have some free time. A while back it landed on Rocky, so I finally started the franchise, and I ended up really enjoying it. I didn’t binge it, but I was super invested, and honestly shocked I’d gone all these years without seeing it. I’d heard about Rocky for a long time, but this was my first time going through every film.

I’m not here to give my personal breakdown or opinion on each movie (although I'd like to 😭I’m sure people have better things to do than read that), but watching Rocky made me realize that even with the hundreds of movies I have seen, I’m still missing out on some incredible stuff.

So, apart from me rambling here, I wanted to ask a simple question: since this is r/Movies, what are some films or series you think I might’ve overlooked? I can’t list everything I’ve seen, but I will gladly hear new recommendations.",reddit_movies,post,9,2025-11-18 15:16:59,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1p0mnih/watching_rocky_was_one_of_the_better_decisions/,354,354,False,256-384
"Casino (1995) Was So Good It’s Painful Kind of random but that movie was so good it kind of ruined movies for me for a while. Like, I use to watch movies more voraciously but now every time I scroll through Prime I’m just thinking “Yeah, it won’t be as good as Casino”. 

I don’t know why Casino in particular but I guess it’s because I never really heard of it and was truly flabbergasted by how solid a film it was. I don’t need to tell you how good this movie is. I really don’t. It’s got one of the most legendary directors directing one of the coolest and most badass actors in the lead role and then Joe Pesci who’s always hilarious. I feel bad he got typecast as the bungling villain from Home Alone because he truly is a dangerous yet funny little munchkin in these gangster movies. He was great in Goodfellas but Pesci’s schtick in Casino was top notch hilarious.

I could describe the plot to you but if you’re at all aware of Martin Scorsese’s style you’ll know what it’s like. It’s a black comedy full of crime of terrible, immoral people slowly getting their comeupance as their criminal empires slip from their grip with things going both hilarious and dangerously wrong. It’s an expertly directed trainwreck of selfish, grimy people making one selfish, grimy decision on top of another until the whole thing implodes and you’re sitting there both laughing and feeling sorry for the cast.

Robert De Niro, though, deserves extra accommodation. I love this man. Whether it’s Goodfellas, Godfather Part 2, Heat or Casino I’m just staring up in ah at how manly, charismatic and cool he is. De Niro is basically the embodiment of every cool trait a guy needs to appear suave and in control on screen and he always brings this otherworldly, near mystic charm with him when he’s on screen. Even though his character, Ace, is kind of immoral, I can’t help but fall in love with him, laughing and fawning over his every move. De Niro is just THAT good at playing a Chad character.",reddit_movies,post,0,2025-11-19 13:50:40,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1p1g7mh/casino_1995_was_so_good_its_painful/,1418,504,True,1K-2K
"What is your opinion on movie recaps? Lately I’ve been thinking a lot about movie recap channels—the ones that condense entire films into a 5–10 minute summary with clips. Personally, I feel like they’re one of the reasons cinema is struggling. Sure, they’re convenient and give the story quickly, but they completely remove the suspense, emotional buildup, and overall experience that makes a movie worth watching in the first place.

As a filmmaker myself, I keep wondering: why isn’t anyone doing anything to stop these channels? Or are people trying, and it just doesn’t work? Is it because of copyright loopholes? Because honestly, it feels weird that someone can take a film people worked years on, cut it into pieces, and retell the story for views.

Are filmmakers actually okay with this? Do studios tolerate it? And if there *are* efforts to stop recap content, why does it keep surviving on YouTube and TikTok?

I’m also curious if anyone genuinely believes recaps are *good* for cinema—like maybe they increase interest or accessibility?

What’s your opinion? Are movie recaps harmless, harmful, or something in between?",reddit_movies,post,0,2025-11-19 15:23:27,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1p1iq2t/what_is_your_opinion_on_movie_recaps/,258,258,False,256-384
"Exploring the culpability of Fredo in The Godfather Part II Hoping to get some discussion on one of my favorite movies of all time. Obviously there will be spoilers here, but the movie is 50+ years old. I think Godfather Part I and Part II are some of the best examples of ""show, don't tell"" movies of all time and thus reward rewatching. I have seen this movie probably a half dozen times and something that I have gone back and forth on is how deserving Fredo was to be killed at the end of Part II. That leads me to backtrack through the films to determine what he did to determine his level of guilt.  

Big picture, Michael ordered the hit on Fredo because he cooperated with Johnny Ola/Roth which provided them the inside information needed for the attempted murder of Michael and his wife that takes place in the beginning of the movie. This makes sense.  

  

However, towards the end of the film, Fredo gives a teary confession to Michael, saying that he didn't know that they were going to try to hit Michael. He just wanted something for his own, he was passed over for his younger brother and no one has ever respected him. Johnny Ola convinces Fredo that by passing information to Roth, Fredo will end up getting more independence from his brother and more respect from the Corleone family. This also makes sense and also explains why I feel sad watching Fredo get killed. Sure, he betrayed his family but he did so with somewhat positive intent, he didn't mean for this to happen.  

  

Here's what's confusing to me: what information *exactly* would Fredo need to pass to Johnny Ola/Roth that would allow them to try to take out Michael?   

1. They mention after the attempted murder that one of the bodyguards ""disappeared"" after the attack (I take this to mean that Fredo provided information to Johnny Ola about which guards would be susceptible to bribes to look the other way.)  
2. They knew the exact room from the outside of the house that Michael slept in.  
3. The fact that Michael kept the windows open during the summer time while he slept.",reddit_movies,post,0,2025-11-19 09:51:54,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1p19pfo/exploring_the_culpability_of_fredo_in_the/,628,476,True,512-1K

"Ninja in The Dragon's Den (1982) fucking RULES. How come this doesn't get recommended enough in martial arts movie circles? The fight scenes are super long and choregraphed I've been watching a bunch of ninja movies, suprisingly not a very big genre. And even less good ones that stand out. But this movie's one of the good ones. It's a Hong Kong action comedy about a ninja who travles to china to complete a mission, and the ninja is a youthful Hiroyuki Sanada who has hit it big these days.



Anyway, this being a HK movie about a ninja would make you think it's probably not gonna be that good. Wrong. WRONG!! They lean into it ***hard***. The ninja fight scenes and special effects fucking rule. Everything you want a ninja to do, they do it in this movie. Every old ninja tool and trick gets refrenced.



But even better than that are the fight scenes. It just goes and goes and goes and goes. They know you're here for the action and they fucking deliver.

"Out of the Furnace [2013] - A detail I can't find anywhere else This movie has commonly been criticized for its ending.



Watching this evening I noticed something that I've been unable to find via any google search.



In the early scenes of the movie, we see Russell and Lena (Bale and Saldana, respectively) in bed together before Russell has to leave to go to work. 



Near the climax/ending of the film, as Russell is setting his trap for Harlan (Woody Harrelson) in motion, at 1:34:00, we see what Wesley (Forest Whitaker), Lena, and Dan (Tom Bower) are doing, and Lena is laying by herself in a bed with the same exact sheets as earlier in the movie. Nearly an hour and a half has gone by since those sheets got about 45 seconds of screen-time, but they are pretty distinctive. She is certainly back in Russell's bed, and given the contemporaneity of the cuts to the other characters, it would be nonsensical to be a flashback. 



Flaws remain with the ending, but I think the idea that Russell and Lena are back together, at least to some degree, and Russell is once again jeopardizing his relationship with Lena with potential jail-time to avenge his brother does improve the ending somewhat. Russell's brother Rodney (Casey Affleck) and Rodney's debt is the reason Russell was out at the bar the night he hit and killed someone, sending him to prison and ruining his life and relationship with Lena. Rodney is once again the motivator for Russell to risk arrest. Finally, this also leaves a lot of questions as to why Wesley would protect Russell by not turning him in after witnessing him kill Harlon. 



Any thoughts or am I making too much of this? Has anyone noticed this before?

"What're the worst movies you've ever seen, from a thematic standpoint? It might be a well built, well acted movie, but what the film actually had to say rubbed you the wrong way. 

I think we can leave Birth of A Nation or Triumph of The Will out of this, as well as some obscure Rumble video maker who dramatized Protocols of The Elders of Zion or something. I don't think this needs to turn into a list of neo Nazi/oldschool Nazi films. 

I'll start with one that's probably not that shocking a take anymore: 300 is a fascist film. It's extremely hard to watch after gaining any sort of political consciousness and not see that the core themes of the films are the virtues of a homogenous, traditional society and how much democracy sucks and how everything would have been fine if the ubermensch king Leonidas wasn't hamstrung by democratic institutions. 

Then there's Dazed and Confused. I know this movie doesn't have much of a plot, but I hate it for what it cherishes. It's full of absolutely horrendous characters, doing horrible things to each other, but the film is utterly uninterested in questioning them, instead treating its normalization as proof that it's all fine in the end. The whole film watches like an unrepentant bully's nostalgia trip. It holds up the absolute worst of American adolescent culture as something to celebrate.

"November 14-16 Box Office Recap – 'Now You See Me: Now You Don't' opens with a solid $21M domestically and $75.2M worldwide. 'The Running Man' flops with just $16.4M domestically and $27.6M worldwide, against a $110M budget. 'Predator: Badlands' collapses a steep 68%, but crosses $130M worldwide. https://preview.redd.it/8x45ohvfbw1g1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e5bde46bef47f0915d87647a50d65c4841348f3

Prior to this weekend, it was expected to be a competitive weekend, with three films trying to reach the #1 spot. But it was ***Now You See Me: Now You Don't*** who triumphed in the end, showing there's still interest in the franchise after 9 years. Paramount's ***The Running Man*** suffered a very poor weekend, while ***Predator: Badlands*** had a brutal second weekend drop. Neon's ***Keeper*** also didn't really light the box office on fire.

The Top 10 earned a combined $68.5 million this weekend. That's up 4.1% from last year, when ***Red One*** debuted at #1.

Debuting at #1, ***Now You See Me: Now You Don't*** debuted with $21 million in 3,403 theaters. That's the franchise's lowest debut; the original debuted with $29 million, and the sequel made $22 million. 

Considering the film's $90 million budget (the most expensive in the franchise), this is not a particularly great start. But this is a franchise that has relied on the overseas markets (we'll get to that later on), so it seems like the domestic market isn't a priority. Lionsgate pretty much sold the film with everything people loved about the franchise: ridiculous magic heists. By this point, you already know what you're getting. And the mixed reviews (59% on RT) won't dissuade those skeptical.

According to Lionsgate, 54% of the audience was female, and 66% was in the 18-34 demographic. They gave it a ""B+"" on CinemaScore, which is the lowest in the franchise (the previous films attained an ""A–"").",reddit_movies,post,128,2025-11-17 17:47:58,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ozv0vn/november_1416_box_office_recap_now_you_see_me_now/,3017,507,True,2K+

"Do you think there should be a genre called ""Life movies"". E.g ""Aftersun"", ""Yi Yi"", ""Paterson"", ""the power of the dog"", 'children of heaven"", ""Paris, Texas"", ""drive my car"", and etc.? These elements would define the genre. ->

1; Subtility -> there are no strong ""ahhh"" scenes, crying is subtle, anger is subtle, happiness is subtle, e.g mom meeting the son in ""Paris, texas"", or kid getting first place while wanting second in ""children of heaven"". There are no strong emotions, just subtle ones(viewers feel strong emotions).

2; not much is changed by the end -> in yi yi main character goes to Japan to do a deal, but at the end deal is canceled(and there is nothing that happens because of it). In Aftersun main character dies, and there is no funeral or anyone crying. Paterson doesn't become a popular writer by the end.

3; just life/monotone scenes(movies are long/slow) -> characters eating, sleeping, walking and etc. E.g Paterson waking up his wife. The shots of nature in ""The power of the dog"". The main character just walking on desert in ""Paris, texas"". This scenes also take up a good amount of the movie, and are important for it(they need to be there)

There are many things that can be added, like, all this movies have soundtracks that feel similar, some of them Don't really have the main character(like in real life), the ending having subtle twist(the girlfriend leaving in ""yi yi"", or peter doing the thing to phil in ""power of the dog"") and etc.

"My wife and I just finished Jurassic World Rebirth and we have thoughts about the ending. Massive Spoilers BTW As soon as the movie ended, my wife looked over at me and said, they are all gonna die... and i had to agree with her. lets go over why. in the end of the movie, the survivors escape the island on a small Zodiac boat, a rigid inflatable with a motor. they have no extra food, or water, or gas for the boat. and they are escaping an isolated island in the middle of the atlantic ocean. with no one looking for them, because it was a secret mission.

add to that, they are right back in the water with the Mosasaur and the Spinos, that already destroyed 2 boats, and they specifically said the mosasaur circles the island to hunt.

even if they somehow make it past the dinos in the ocean, what are the chances they make it to civilization in a Zodiac, with no extra fuel, no paddles, no food, no water, also, they said that there are almost no patrols, because who would be stupid enough to go near that island.

ALSO ALSO, thier plan, to open source the samples. how would a couple of mercenaries, and an out of work museum coordinator/archeologist even open source 3 tissue samples from dinos?

and even if they did, doesnt that just mean that the big pharma company still gets the samples? they just dont have to pay the 100m that they were promised. because if they make the samples free to everyone, the big pharma company would get them too. and all they needed was the samples to bring thier drug to testing. it would put them like a decade in front of anyone else. they would still make untold billions or trillions curing heart disease before anyone else could bring a drug to market.

"Dead Poets Society Hi to all, so I am just in this venture of watching great movies of all time, Imdb as my reference. Social media has greatly increased the chance of knowing major plots in a movie right, so I see reels and posts about Dead Poets Society but I haven't really watched it yet. I decided to watch it now, and wow I had no idea that Neil Perry will actually take his life. That scene was heavy... I was devastated. ALL this time, those who have watched the movie and liked it are carrying this weight? Also carrying this great masterpiece in their hearts and minds? I am so glad I watched the movie and experienced all scenes raw and really feeling everything for the first time. Great acting and actors. For it to be made in 1989 but hold this much artistry and depth in how its portrayed is the reason why I like cinema so much. It's timeless!! I now understand why it's in Top 7.

"Is there a more iconic piece of movie music than the Imperial March (Darth Vader's Theme)? I've really made screening movies in my home something of a hobby the past few months. Built a home theater mainly out of components I bought off of Craigslist. (What a steal!) This weekend I had the best movie party yet, and we watched *The Empire Strikes Back.* A couple days before I had people over, I was thinking about how exciting it was going to be to have a bunch of people in the room with me watching this amazing movie the first time I got to hear this song on my nice sound system.

It got me thinking... Is there a single piece of movie music more iconic than Darth Vader's theme, *ever*? Don't get me wrong, there's plenty of amazing pieces of movie score I can recall, and I can think of at least several that are *comparably* famous to this one. But every song that comes to mind, I can't help thinking – yeah, that's a famous song, but Darth Vader's theme is *definitely* EVEN MORE famous.

I think it's the most famous *Star Wars* song, even moreso than the title theme. Is there a serious competitor, or is this just clearly the most iconic movie music ever?

EDIT: Of the answers I've received so far, I think ""Over the Rainbow"" is clearly the most fitting. What a banger. That's definitely in contention.

EDIT 2: I should have mentioned *Jaws* in my last edit, since that one was on my mind even before I posted. It's clearly in the same ""weight class,"" so to speak. But I think Vader's theme is clearly more iconic even than that.

EDIT 3: Seems like if there's ever going to be an answer somewhat widely agreed upon, it's the theme from *Jaws*. And although ""Over the Rainbow"" really swayed me, I think I have to agree with all the commenters here that it's the most worthy competitor.",reddit_movies,post,0,2025-11-18 23:41:52,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1p0yaa6/is_there_a_more_iconic_piece_of_movie_music_than/,424,424,False,384-512

"What Film Most Deserved an Oscar Nomination yet Received None? I struggle to answer this question. I was shocked to notice some films that didn't receive a single nomination at the Oscars. If I could vote for a single film it would be The Shining. Somehow, some way, it received zero nominations at the 1981 Oscars.

1980 had some pretty stupendous films such as Ordinary People, The Elephant Man, and Raging Bull, but I'd consider The Shining above them all. There a handful of incredible films to not receive a single nomination throughout history, but what I'd say separates The Shining, is the number of nominations it was deserving of. There were so many categories where a win or at least a nomination should have happened.

The Shining may not have been Stanley Kubrick's most influential film, but it was Kubrick's most spotless. Is this the biggest screw up in the history of the Oscars, it must be.

"I think I found a way to fix the Old Biff problem in Back To The Future 2 Okay, so I'm not 100% sure this is the right sub for this one, but it seems the logical place to start.  I was rewatching BTTF2 and it bugged me how Old Biff steals the DeLorean in 2015, goes back to 1955, gives himself the almanac, and then returns to the same 2015 Doc and Marty are in.  That shouldn't be possible, since it breaks the movie's own rules - the second he hands off the book in 1955, the future tangents.  Old Biff should have returned to a tangential 2015 resulting from that event, leaving Doc and Marty stranded without the DeLorean.    
I didn't realize it, but apparently this is a pretty well-known problem with the movie, and people have tried to explain and make it work...even Zemekis.  

I think I might have figured out a clean way to make the whole problem work without breaking anything in the movie (go with me on this, it'll take a minute to explain):

What if Biff handing himself the almanac in 1955 didn't just create a tangent *timeline*, but also a tangent *Biff*? At the moment of the handoff, two versions of Biff exist from that point forward. One version is the “normal” one that becomes Old Biff — the one whose life always played out without the almanac ever influencing anything. That Biff figured Old Biff was just some crazy old man, threw the almanac away, and forgot about it. He grows old, finds the DeLorean in 2015, steals the almanac (maybe realizing he screwed up when he was young and now he's determined to correct his earlier mistake), goes back, hands himself the thing, and then returns to his own 2015. So, in Old Biff's personal timeline, giving himself the almanac changed nothing. His life still led to the moment where he steals the Time Machine, and he returns to the future he came from - the one where he failed to make use of the almanac at all.

The *other*  Biff — the tangent version — is the one whose life *was* altered by receiving the book. He’s the one who uses it, becomes a billionaire, and creates the hellscape Trump-inspired 1985.",reddit_movies,post,0,2025-11-18 19:42:40,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1p0t99e/i_think_i_found_a_way_to_fix_the_old_biff_problem/,983,506,True,512-1K

"What are examples of unmade films that feel like the chances of being great or terrible are 50/50? When we talk about unmade film concepts, we usually see where there is ""This would've been amazing"" or ""This looks like a disaster waiting to happen, glad it never occurred."" But for this conversation, I wanted to learn more about unmade films where it actually is a 50/50 chance it would've been a masterpiece or it would fail badly, and of course because they're unmade, we can never truly know what it would've been like. For some examples I thought of:

\- 21 Jump Street 3 (where they tie-in to Men in Black series): While it sounds so crazy and way off, remember how they did both a remake of an old series and sequel that are both considered great films, so there is also the chance that the filmmakers would've also struck gold again.

\- Jodorowsky's Dune: From all the concept art and the documentary, many say that this would've been a dud and really bad. However, considering the talent of Alejandro Jodorowsky, history of risky films that ended up successful, how many talented artists were behind it, and the possibility of improvising with a surprisinhly small budget for the scale of his vision, it might've still sucked as an adaptation but could've been a masterpiece in sci-fi arthouse cinema

\- A Topiary (and to an extent The Modern Ocean): While the scripts have been released and are really weird and cryptic, had Shane Carruth obtained the funding to these films, he could've used his filmmaking process that we don't see, and with the proper actors it could've been a much more interesting film than what our imaginations can give us.

"Movies where just describing the premise makes you uncomfortable? This is inspired by Novocaine. I'm not saying it's a bad movie at all. Using it as the basis for a romantic comedy is certainly inspired, and it's potentially thematically rich. I understand it was liked by critics and general audiences if Rotten Tomatoes is anything to go by: [https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/novocaine\_2025](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/novocaine_2025)

  
However just thinking about the premise of being injured but not feeling the pain of it makes me wince. Beyond how much Jack Quaid's character is injured and unnervingly unbothered by it from the trailers, it just makes me imagine having his condition and having an injury that might become life-threatening without being aware of it, so I would be paradoxically extra paranoid about getting into any situation where I might be injured. 

This is unusual for me because I'm a horror fan and have seen some really disturbing simulated injuries in movies while still enjoying the experience over all. 

Is this unusual in general? Do other people feel this way about Novocaine or have specific movies or general premises that make them unable to watch movies no matter who good or bad they are?

"Here's a tantalizing moral quandary about AI im movies, dig this one. I generally hate de-aging. Im a big fan of clever casting and analog solutions when it comes to people playing younger versions of people. (Austin Butler BETTER still be playing younger Val Kilmer in Heat 2...)

Now check this out:

I had an idea for a fan script sequel to Trie Lies, but Id only want Robert Duvall to play the bad guy (He would be Harry's former boss and the guy who trained him, who goes rogue.) However, Robert Duvall is 90 years old and can barely speak/walk, let alone do any action.

What if there was an AI program or something that could either flawlessly recreate an all-digital younger Duvall, or put his face on a younger actor, but Duvall is basically there as an advisor and essentially consulting on the whole process of making ""him"" so that it's still in his control? 

The broader question is, as long as the actor is still alive and still involved in the process, would you as movie fans be opposed to recreating an actor at any age, as long as they're still alive and involved in the process? Do you think it would bother you or put you off? Are you opposed to it on general principle? 🤔

I honestly dont know how Id feel about it, even as the author of this question. (I know they did it with Luke Skywalker in Mandalorian, but Im talking about a whole feature and in perpetuity) ",reddit_movies,post,0,2025-11-18 20:55:42,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1p0uv4n/heres_a_tantalizing_moral_quandary_about_ai_im/,328,328,False,256-384

"Fun movie draft ideas? My brothers and I have been consistently watching a movie every week for the past 7 weeks or so together and just yacking about them afterwards. We thought it would be to do a sort of Draft with various categories. Just looking for different topics we can try. 

Thinking things like 

Desert Island, you can only watch the movies you draft 

Weekend Away, Draft from the pool of characters we have watched and we have to spend a weekend with them

How to die, draft from all the deaths we have seen in a film as ways we would want to die 

Stuff like that

Edit: So let's say the topic is Desert Island. We would each pick 1 movie at a time to add to our list. Once a movie is picked, it's not available to be chosen again. 

So at the end I would have a list of movies that I would bring to a desert island, my other brother would have his own unique list, and same with my brother

Any suggestions? ",reddit_movies,post,0,2025-11-18 11:50:56,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1p0h2k1/fun_movie_draft_ideas/,223,223,False,128-256
"Just rewatched ""The Family Man"" solid movie that makes you think what you want out of life Watched it for the first time years ago not expecting much but found it to be surprisingly emotional.   The movie is essentially about a guy who chose a career over staying with his gf and flash forward years later and he's living a very financially successful life but without any family.  Through a series of events he gets placed in alternate life where he's now in a middle class lifestyle married to his former gf and has kids.  

  
I know theres been plenty of other movies that have done a similar concept of transporting a character to an alternate reality  and seeing what could have been before but for some reason this movie has always stuck with me.   

Makes you think about the path of going down either having a family or choosing not to have that life or maybe wanting it but it just never happened for you and ultimately have to come to peace with either scenario.

Always thought the ending was interesting how it transports him back to his rich and single lifestyle after he had just begun to enjoy having a family and how he now views his life differently",reddit_movies,post,142,2025-11-16 21:54:59,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1oz53ka/just_rewatched_the_family_man_solid_movie_that/,244,244,False,128-256

"How do or will you remember your favorite actors? So of course, your favorite actors won’t always be GOATs…that’s why I’m making that distinction.  Maybe the answers will be the same, maybe not

Do you remember your favorite actors based on their best work? The way they make you feel?   Something else?

In my case, my favorite actor before now has been Michael Crawford - OG Phantom of the Opera (my favorite show). When I heard the cast recording of the original, I fell in love with his voice.  I then watched another of his shows (London West End, on DVD), and just fell in love again with his incredible talent. He was (still alive) an incredible comedian as well, who did all his own stunts. So with Michael, I was/am so drawn to his talent

Now I’m doing a deep dive on Al Pacino, and in many ways it’s similar to why I was drawn to Michael: extraordinary talent.  But it’s more than that for me, and so the same reason I love him is the same reason I will remember him.  Al loves words, he loves language. He is passionate about acting - more than that even, Al has said he HAD to do it, there was something in him, that he was born to act.

Sidney Lumet said this once, and it can’t be said any better:

“Everything stems from some incredible core inside of him. I wouldn’t think of trying to get near it, because it would be like getting somewhere near the center of the earth. What comes out of his core is so uniquely his own.”

So, why will you remember your favorites?",reddit_movies,post,0,2025-11-18 10:17:50,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1p0elgj/how_do_or_will_you_remember_your_favorite_actors/,376,376,False,256-384

I also really admire the same directors( Gary Fleder. He has sadly dissappeared but his movies are always solid entertainment) later movie, Don’t say a Word. It’s silly but it so gets the job Done,it has a great energy,it’s tense. Michael Douglas vs Sean Bean and with the lovely Brittany Murphy in a role tailormade for her and she nails it. Fleder also directed two movies approved by critics,Runaway jury and The express. I apologize for straying but this makes me feel like I should do a Gary Fleder appreciation post. The wolfman deserves A MUCH BETTER IMDB RATING. Only 5.8 is nuts to me.



Gangs of New York seems if not widely disliked, then sadly concidered one of Scorseses lesser efforts and even though I am pissed with Scorsese for his work to be truncated and leave about TWO hours  on the editing floor cause of Harvey Weinsteins opinion, that movie is still fantastic. Michael Ballhaus has shot it with such an restless, intruding energy and the world Scorsese creates is so vivid and immersive.

"What exactly do you think a movie trailer is?  Because, to me, it looks like a brief summary of the movie's story that reveals a number of the dramatic moments.  In some cases, one might argue they reveal ALL the important moments.

How many people will go to see your movie if you don't advertise and run trailers for it?

>As a filmmaker myself, I keep wondering: why isn’t anyone doing anything to stop these channels?

Because free speech is a thing.  Also, there's a well-known proverb about ""no such thing as bad PR.""  These people want to advertise your movie for free, who are you to stop them?

There will invariably be people who watch the 5 minute clip version and then think ""that was fun, I'd like to see the full version.""  At least *some* of these people will not have set aside the time to watch the full version without it.

>Are filmmakers actually okay with this? Do studios tolerate it?

If your film can't stand up to a little criticism (including people retelling the basic plot in a fraction of the runtime) or maintain interest when people *talk about it* first, then *maybe* it wasn't that good to begin with.

Because people have always told one another about that movie they saw last weekend, which generally involves giving a brief summary of the plot and/or telling their friends about the cool parts.  People asking for or giving out extremely shortened summaries of a movie is not a new thing.  Maybe more widespread on the internet, but not new.  Ever heard of ""water cooler talk?""

>What’s your opinion? Are movie recaps harmless, harmful, or something in between?

I think they're harmless.  I think people who don't want them to ruin the experience of the full movie can make their own decision not to watch such channels.

Just like the guy who has a million dollar idea for an app will probably never see it made, a 5 minute recap of your movie is not going to meaningfully hurt its profitability.  And they're certainly not going to impact the artistic or emotional value of the film because, per your own admission, these recap channels tend to cut all of that stuff out.

Ideas are cheap, the value is in the full effort.",reddit_movies,comment,1,2025-11-19 16:13:59,https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1p1iq2t/what_is_your_opinion_on_movie_recaps/npqhbqg/,540,495,True,512-1K

"Black Mirror’s “nosedive” isn’t the future it’s already here just quieter I rewatched black mirror’s “nosedive” and it honestly doesn’t feel like a dystopian warning anymore. It feels like a documentary we just filmed a few years early. The whole episode is about people obsessively managing a public score like smiling, performing, editing their personalities to earn tiny digital points. But look around: we’re already doing it. We rate uber drivers, and they rate us. Restaurants live or die by yelp stars. airbnbs demand spotless mutual reviews. linkedIn endorsements and “professional reputation signals” literally affect hiring. Earlier while enjoying a chill round of jackpot city on my phone I caught myself thinking how refreshing it is to do something that doesn’t care about social scores at all. Even social platforms quietly push our content into the void if we don’t play the algorithm’s game correctly. We’re already performing for algorithmic approval the only difference is we don’t have the score floating above our foreheads yet. The incentives are just hidden inside apps, dashboards and “engagement metrics.”

“Nosedive” isn’t a warning about something that might happen. It’s a slightly exaggerated version of what we quietly accepted already.",reddit_television,post,719,2025-11-18 17:32:56,https://reddit.com/r/television/comments/1p0q73q/black_mirrors_nosedive_isnt_the_future_its/,297,297,False,256-384

Here are mine:
- American Dad! (Moved to TBS after being cancelled by Fox. Loved how it seemed like it became more unhinged and chaotic on TBS. And now TBS declined to order more episodes of the show, so it’s returning to Fox lol.)

- Reno 911 (Ended its original run in 2009 by being cancelled by Comedy Central. Was revived by Quibi in 2020 then moved to Roku. And got 2 additional movies in the 2020s. Through all this the show still retained its humor, style, and quality.)

- The Amazing World of Gumball (Cartoon Network ended the show in 2019 and Hulu brought it back this year as The Wonderfully Weird World of Gumball.

I have a sound bar and have Center turned all the way up to help with action scenes but it doesnt help with when people talk low because all the dialog comes through the center channel so it raises the normal Loudness talking parts higher too.

The writing in landman,is possibly the worst i have seen  ever for a show of this  budget.


The daughter literally tells her father how her boyfriend comes in her.

Apparantly a windturbine has more carbon emissions than an oil rig,just factually wrong

The main character constantly attacks his wife  asking if she's moody causes she's on her period,cause women apparantly can't control their emotions

The same daughter again  just this week went on a rant about how she wants to fuck a quarterback to make superior white babys (NOT EVEN JOKING) 

Taylor just thinks women sit in bathrooms talking about how  

i quote

""im going to suck that old dudes  balls dry on the plane to mexico so he buys me what i want"" lol


Apparantly,No one ever ate breakfast in all of humanity till kellogs came around

Also doesn't understand how the economy works,you can't hold an AGM,and NOT tell ur shareholders ur plans that's literally illegal,you must provide profit predictions and quarterly results lol

The show had a 3 minute and 20 second rant by billy bob about how breakfast didn't exist untill kellogs made it a thing...clearly that's taylor speaking to the viewer.

"What’s with all the music edits on the 7th Heaven DVDs? Was CBS/Paramount unable to pay for ANY of the licensing?? It’s been so long since I watched 7th Heaven since it first aired. So I bought a bunch of the DVDs from eBay and discovered that some of the music I remembered is now gone from the DVDs. Here are some examples.

Season 5- There was one episode where Mary dances to “Love Shack”. The music here has been replaced and you can see one part where Mary is mouthing the Love Shack lyrics which isn’t matching the replaced song. 

Season 6- Ruthie sings “I Won’t Back Down” as part of a school project. This part has been completely cut out of the episode.

Season 9- after Ruthie’s first date, she plays “Kiss Me” on the radio. Music here has been replaced and the part where Eric sings along to the Kiss Me song has been completely edited out.

Season 10- at the end of the finale, Roy Orbison’s “You Got It” plays while we see Then and Now clips of the Camdens before the ending credits roll. The music here has been completely replaced. Ironically this song is on the Season 1 DVD and intact in the pilot episode. So why weren’t they able to pay for the licensing here???

These are only a handful of music that I distinctly remembered and are now gone from the DVDs. Why on earth was it so difficult for CBS/Paramount to obtain the licensing for ANY of these songs??? I’m surprised there wasn’t any backlash from fans regarding this because there really wasn’t a whole lot of music here, so I don’t understand why no effort was made to relicense some of this music, especially the above I just mentioned since those songs in particular were essential to the plot of the episodes.

"The Opening of ""The Penguin"" Is Nothing Like The Rest of The Show I found the show through the first scene of the first episode on youtube were Penguin kills Alberto Falco. Everyone was glazing it as the best opening in a show and yeah it was pretty good.

The opening scene was dark and felt grounded, unfortunately everything after was a dissapointment. It turns out the show isnt actually grounded at all and tries really hard to be funny and is also very outlandish. Like right after the opening scene Penguin starts trying to shoot kids that are taking apart his car but misses at point blank range and then takes one prisoner who becomes his sidekick?

The opening scene hooks you in but the rest of the show is nothing like it, and honestly is pretty meh.",reddit_television,post,0,2025-11-19 14:24:27,https://reddit.com/r/television/comments/1p1h4xs/the_opening_of_the_penguin_is_nothing_like_the/,160,160,False,128-256

"The ending of 'The Good Place' ruined the whole show. Hi friends, so, i got into academic philosophy of religion and theology as a hobby and also got into it because of my anxiety and OCD issues (diagnosed... so, i am not self-diagnosing or anything), and one of the things i found cross culturally in all religions (such as Hinduism, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Buddhism, Shintoism, Bahai religion, etc.) is that - afterlife never ever gets boring or depressing, and will have never-ending or infinite amounts of happiness and to be precise, lots of different kinds of pleasant or positive feelings such as enjoyment, exhilaration, exultation, gladness, gratification, gratitude, contentment, joy, liking, love, relief, euphoria, satisfaction, tranquility, delight, ecstasy, elation, etc., and infinite amount of wonderful activities to do! 

  
Spoilers below if you have not seen the good place.

  


>!Now, the good place nicely criticizes the right-wing interpretations of religions considering that eternal hell (eternal torture or eternal conscious torment or even annihilation of some souls) is indeed a very horrible, nightmarish, demented view. But there are [Christian Universalists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_universalism) and similarly Islamic universalists who believe that all souls, including non-human animals, that is, all sentient beings basically, shall eventually go to heaven and live in great happiness forever with lots of enjoyable activities to do. And the souls who did cause pain and deaths shall suffer for a while in temporary hell or purgatory, and after going through their punishment, they shall go to heaven. (Hinduism and Buddhism are already universalists by the way)!<

>!So, from my theistic (Christian Universalist) view, the good place's ending has an objectively bad moral message or lesson. The good place literally tells that there is depression, that is, major depressive disorder in heaven! It tells the audience that your happiness will eventually run out even in literal fucking heaven. It treats the wonderful activities human beings engage in as just 'use and throw \[and never wanna do that again\]'. It is as if the writers simply didn't think that human beings engage in same activities repeatedly and still get pleasure like...",reddit_television,post,0,2025-11-19 14:12:33,https://reddit.com/r/television/comments/1p1gtah/the_ending_of_the_good_place_ruined_the_whole_show/,978,492,True,512-1K

It was soooo good, it had me hooked so bad to understand what is going on, the characters where so fun to watch and develop. I loved getting to see Green and Turner actually being smart good detective, and that it was just the stupid script that made them look stupid at the begining (the inside script, not the actualy shows script). I just really enjoyed it, at every turn where it seemed a character was going to make a stupid decision, they didnt, they actually thought about it, and did the sensible smart decision.  I dont know how to explain further, it just felt good to watch and a little trippy at times, somethings I didnt know if they were just skipping, or actually tping. HOWEVER! The ending confused me so much, and so many questions left unanswered. Anyone whose read the book know if it answers more questions?

So when I subscribed to Disney+ and Hulu, I was excited to begin the series. A month later, I'm halfway through the first season and it's been a slog. The storylines are not interconnected enough, the episodes don't really build off each other, the characters are quite dull, and the show doesn't even have the gritty, urban milieu of shows like *The Wire* or T*he Sopranos*.

"Haven and From - similar vibe If you have watched both shows, do you think they give off similar vibe? Would you recommend one of them to someone who watched another?

I noticed at first that they have very similar vibe from their intros. 

Obviously shows themselves aren't the same, but both are about mysterious town with local mythology and references to the past, where you don't really understand what's going on until later.

I feel that From leans more into mysterious aspect tho, while Haven focuses more on characters, their development and ""monster (trouble) of the week"" trope",reddit_television,post,0,2025-11-17 11:31:01,https://reddit.com/r/television/comments/1ozkvl8/haven_and_from_similar_vibe/,126,126,False,0-128

"What are some of the best examples of a character ""haunting the narrative""? Most interesting/unique/subverting tropes/etc.

Haunting the narrative is usually defined as a character that does not appear in the main story but materially changes the course of the story/the characters in the story. I suppose some would argue the character is allowed to be in flashbacks or the first episode or so.

It's very common in cop/detective shows from the last 20 years to write in some sort of overarching tragedy/mystery like the cop joins the police force to find his wife's murderer, that's practically cliche at this point.

And there are plenty of sitcoms that begin with some dark catalyst like the main character losing their entire family so they're forced to move in with their zany upstairs neighbor. But in the case of sitcoms, a lot of shows intentionally don't allow the dead character to haunt the narrative except for the occasional ""Very special episode.""

But I think there are ways to do it that are interesting as well. Rebecca is the classic literary example, she even snagged the book title.",reddit_television,post,0,2025-11-17 13:09:50,https://reddit.com/r/television/comments/1oznkq1/what_are_some_of_the_best_examples_of_a_character/,234,234,False,128-256

"I'm really shocked at the lack of plot development in Pluribus. Vince Gilligan has created the greatest television show of all time with BB and followed it up with BCS, a slightly different masterpiece with a slight different tone. I'm still holding out on something that is truly gripping with Pluribus based solely on the fact that Vince and Seehorn are involved. Rhea is a wonderful actress as we know from BCS. So far, her character is not that well portrayed. She's completely unlikable (I can tell that's on purpose.) But theres an extent to which an unlikable character can have screen time doing the exact same thing over and over when nothing else in the show is moving forward. 

Her business partner who dies in the first ep is also completely unlikable and is far from interesting. 

The ""other"" survivors seem useless. Their aura and pointless dialogue seems like they (hopefully) won't be around long in the show. I'm not seeing how any of them have enough charisma to help carry a plot. 

Ep3 showed is absolutely nothing besides Carol mentioning in a flashback that she froze eggs? Okay? Surely that comes in to place. 

I'm still barely holding out but if ep4 isn't interesting I think I'm good to just wait until the entire season is out to binge. If you're going to make a show go week to week with releases there has to be a weekly reward otherwise life is too taxing and everyone has too many things to do.

"I live in San Antonio, and am familiar with the neighborhood where he was murdered. It’s a rough neighborhood (he lived in the house his parents left to him). There had been some reports locally that he got arrested for some public intoxication issue (one report said he was on his roof yelling at neighbors). Nothing that would be out of the ordinary on a Saturday night in Harlandale, but there were reports that Jonathan was having issues.  

Additional local reports have said that this murder charge took a long time because a.) officers didn’t immediately suspect the neighbor for a hate crime and b.) they had to gather additional legal evidence that this was a hate crime not just a concerned neighbor who was defending himself against a man with an erratic pattern of behavior. And I’m glad to see these charges. 

No one deserves to go out like he did. And I hope the man who killed him goes away for a long time. But the delay in this case is apparently because prosecutors had to make sure they could clear the legal requirements for this charge to stick, which was complicated given the history.

"I think BSG more bridged the gap between the shows that were episodic and serial. Sure, the group would be stuck on some planet or in space or something, or there'd be an uprising on civilian ships and such, but you could fully get that just through context and things being re-explained in a particular episode that you watched. BSG ultimately had few two-parter episodes where you really needed to see one to get the other. Big-arc with many little arcs is another way to put it.    
In BSG it was more rewarding if you watched it all in order and didn't miss an episode, but you could still follow it and have a good time just tuning in for like every 16 out of 18 episodes.

In SGU, you'd be completely lost if you missed an episode, imo. The pay-off for one episode often didn't show up until 1-4 episodes later. But it was great if you watched it in series.",reddit_television,comment,1,2025-11-19 16:19:43,https://reddit.com/r/television/comments/1p1d5a5/new_stargate_tv_series_ordered_at_amazon_from/npqih21/,206,206,False,128-256

"Go look at Fincher’s list of unrealized projects on Wikipedia; he’s always been very open to working on mainstream IP, he just can never get a studio onboard with his vision. Only reason he didn’t do Spider-Man was because he wanted to skip the origin story and just start with Peter Parker already being Spider-Man for years; Sony didn’t want that. His remake of Utopia for HBO didn’t happen because HBO gave it a $90 million production budget, but Fincher wanted $100 million. HBO wouldn’t budge, so he walked. Budget issues derailed his remake of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, as well, something he seemed really excited about when discussing in interviews. He was attached to a World War Z sequel for a couple of years, but couldn’t agree with the studio on the creative direction.

Beyond all that, everything Fincher has done in his career has been mainstream. He’s one of the most acclaimed filmmakers alive, but he’s never been an arthouse filmmaker. Debatably, he’s not even an auteur since he doesn’t write his films. Hell, the dude got his start in music videos and his feature debut was Alien 3. A significant chunk of his filmography is adaptations, as well. If anything, his last two movies were his least Hollywood friendly projects to date - both Mank and The Killer were movies he wanted to make over twenty years ago, he couldn’t get the legacy studios to back them. He finally got enough goodwill with Netflix to fund them, and now he’s paying them back with more mainstream projects with the Cliff Booth movie and a new Squid Game show.",reddit_television,comment,1,2025-11-19 16:05:41,https://reddit.com/r/television/comments/1p1fx08/david_finchers_squid_game_america_to_begin/npqfogh/,367,367,False,256-384

What bad guy poses a threat when Tauri are now the most advanced civilization around?

Asgard were already a deus ex machina that occasionally just swooped in to solve problems. They were prevented from being a fix all solution because they were busy and had treaties. 


But if Tauri have all the same tech as Asgard and then some it will quickly become increasingly contrived situations where they can’t use it.
